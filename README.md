| **[SuperEvent: Cross-Modal Learning of Event-based Keypoint Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00139v1)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event-based keypoint detection and matching holds significant potential, enabling the integration of event sensors into highly optimized Visual SLAM systems developed for frame cameras over decades of research. Unfortunately, existing approaches struggle with the motion-dependent appearance of keypoints and the complex noise prevalent in event streams, resulting in severely limited feature matching capabilities and poor performance on downstream tasks. To mitigate this problem, we propose SuperEvent, a data-driven approach to predict stable keypoints with expressive descriptors. Due to the absence of event datasets with ground truth keypoint labels, we leverage existing frame-based keypoint detectors on readily available event-aligned and synchronized gray-scale frames for self-supervision: we generate temporally sparse keypoint pseudo-labels considering that events are a product of both scene appearance and camera motion. Combined with our novel, information-rich event representation, we enable SuperEvent to effectively learn robust keypoint detection and description in event streams. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of SuperEvent by its integration into a modern sparse keypoint and descriptor-based SLAM framework originally developed for traditional cameras, surpassing the state-of-the-art in event-based SLAM by a wide margin.

| **[ROVER: A Multi-Season Dataset for Visual SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02506v2)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust SLAM is a crucial enabler for autonomous navigation in natural, semi-structured environments such as parks and gardens. However, these environments present unique challenges for SLAM due to frequent seasonal changes, varying light conditions, and dense vegetation. These factors often degrade the performance of visual SLAM algorithms originally developed for structured urban environments. To address this gap, we present ROVER, a comprehensive benchmark dataset tailored for evaluating visual SLAM algorithms under diverse environmental conditions and spatial configurations. We captured the dataset with a robotic platform equipped with monocular, stereo, and RGBD cameras, as well as inertial sensors. It covers 39 recordings across five outdoor locations, collected through all seasons and various lighting scenarios, i.e., day, dusk, and night with and without external lighting. With this novel dataset, we evaluate several traditional and deep learning-based SLAM methods and study their performance in diverse challenging conditions. The results demonstrate that while stereo-inertial and RGBD configurations generally perform better under favorable lighting and moderate vegetation, most SLAM systems perform poorly in low-light and high-vegetation scenarios, particularly during summer and autumn. Our analysis highlights the need for improved adaptability in visual SLAM algorithms for outdoor applications, as current systems struggle with dynamic environmental factors affecting scale, feature extraction, and trajectory consistency. This dataset provides a solid foundation for advancing visual SLAM research in real-world, semi-structured environments, fostering the development of more resilient SLAM systems for long-term outdoor localization and mapping. The dataset and the code of the benchmark are available under https://iis-esslingen.github.io/rover.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 9 figures, 12 tables</p></details> |
| **[Survey on Monocular Metric Depth Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11841v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) is fundamental to computer vision, enabling spatial understanding, 3D reconstruction, and autonomous driving. Deep learning-based MDE predicts relative depth from a single image, but the lack of metric scale introduces inconsistencies, limiting applicability in tasks such as visual SLAM, 3D reconstruction, and novel view synthesis. Monocular Metric Depth Estimation (MMDE) overcomes this limitation by enabling precise scene-scale inference, improving depth consistency, enhancing stability in sequential tasks, and streamlining integration into practical systems. This paper systematically reviews the evolution of depth estimation, from traditional geometric methods to deep learning breakthroughs, emphasizing scale-agnostic approaches in zero-shot generalization which is crucial for advancing MMDE. Recent progress in zero-shot MMDE is examined, focusing on challenges such as model generalization and boundary detail loss. To address these issues, researchers have explored unlabeled data augmentation, image patching, architectural optimization, and generative techniques. This review analyzes these developments, assessing their impact and limitations. Key findings are synthesized, unresolved challenges outlined, and future research direction proposal. By providing a clear technical roadmap and insight into emerging trends, this work aims to drive innovation and expand the real-world applications of MMDE.</p></details> |  |
| **[MCVO: A Generic Visual Odometry for Arbitrarily Arranged Multi-Cameras](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03146v2)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Making multi-camera visual SLAM systems easier to set up and more robust to the environment is attractive for vision robots. Existing monocular and binocular vision SLAM systems have narrow sensing Field-of-View (FoV), resulting in degenerated accuracy and limited robustness in textureless environments. Thus multi-camera SLAM systems are gaining attention because they can provide redundancy with much wider FoV. However, the usual arbitrary placement and orientation of multiple cameras make the pose scale estimation and system updating challenging. To address these problems, we propose a robust visual odometry system for rigidly-bundled arbitrarily-arranged multi-cameras, namely MCVO, which can achieve metric-scale state estimation with high flexibility in the cameras' arrangement. Specifically, we first design a learning-based feature tracking framework to shift the pressure of CPU processing of multiple video streams to GPU. Then we initialize the odometry system with the metric-scale poses under the rigid constraints between moving cameras. Finally, we fuse the features of the multi-cameras in the back-end to achieve robust pose estimation and online scale optimization. Additionally, multi-camera features help improve the loop detection for pose graph optimization. Experiments on KITTI-360 and MultiCamData datasets validate its robustness over arbitrarily arranged cameras. Compared with other stereo and multi-camera visual SLAM systems, our method obtains higher pose accuracy with better generalization ability. Our codes and online demos are available at https://github.com/JunhaoWang615/MCVO</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Loop Closure from Two Views: Revisiting PGO for Scalable Trajectory Estimation through Monocular Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16275v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>(Visual) Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) remains a fundamental challenge in enabling autonomous systems to navigate and understand large-scale environments. Traditional SLAM approaches struggle to balance efficiency and accuracy, particularly in large-scale settings where extensive computational resources are required for scene reconstruction and Bundle Adjustment (BA). However, this scene reconstruction, in the form of sparse pointclouds of visual landmarks, is often only used within the SLAM system because navigation and planning methods require different map representations. In this work, we therefore investigate a more scalable Visual SLAM (VSLAM) approach without reconstruction, mainly based on approaches for two-view loop closures. By restricting the map to a sparse keyframed pose graph without dense geometry representations, our '2GO' system achieves efficient optimization with competitive absolute trajectory accuracy. In particular, we find that recent advancements in image matching and monocular depth priors enable very accurate trajectory optimization from two-view edges. We conduct extensive experiments on diverse datasets, including large-scale scenarios, and provide a detailed analysis of the trade-offs between runtime, accuracy, and map size. Our results demonstrate that this streamlined approach supports real-time performance, scales well in map size and trajectory duration, and effectively broadens the capabilities of VSLAM for long-duration deployments to large environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[NF-SLAM: Effective, Normalizing Flow-supported Neural Field representations for object-level visual SLAM in automotive applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11199v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel, vision-only object-level SLAM framework for automotive applications representing 3D shapes by implicit signed distance functions. Our key innovation consists of augmenting the standard neural representation by a normalizing flow network. As a result, achieving strong representation power on the specific class of road vehicles is made possible by compact networks with only 16-dimensional latent codes. Furthermore, the newly proposed architecture exhibits a significant performance improvement in the presence of only sparse and noisy data, which is demonstrated through comparative experiments on synthetic data. The module is embedded into the back-end of a stereo-vision based framework for joint, incremental shape optimization. The loss function is given by a combination of a sparse 3D point-based SDF loss, a sparse rendering loss, and a semantic mask-based silhouette-consistency term. We furthermore leverage semantic information to determine keypoint extraction density in the front-end. Finally, experimental results on real-world data reveal accurate and reliable performance comparable to alternative frameworks that make use of direct depth readings. The proposed method performs well with only sparse 3D points obtained from bundle adjustment, and eventually continues to deliver stable results even under exclusive use of the mask-consistency term.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, IROS 2024</p></details> |
| **[MonoSLAM: Robust Monocular SLAM with Global Structure Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09296v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a robust monocular visual SLAM system that simultaneously utilizes point, line, and vanishing point features for accurate camera pose estimation and mapping. To address the critical challenge of achieving reliable localization in low-texture environments, where traditional point-based systems often fail due to insufficient visual features, we introduce a novel approach leveraging Global Primitives structural information to improve the system's robustness and accuracy performance. Our key innovation lies in constructing vanishing points from line features and proposing a weighted fusion strategy to build Global Primitives in the world coordinate system. This strategy associates multiple frames with non-overlapping regions and formulates a multi-frame reprojection error optimization, significantly improving tracking accuracy in texture-scarce scenarios. Evaluations on various datasets show that our system outperforms state-of-the-art methods in trajectory precision, particularly in challenging environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[AirSwarm: Enabling Cost-Effective Multi-UAV Research with COTS drones](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06890v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm missions rely heavily on expensive custom-made drones with onboard perception or external positioning systems, limiting their widespread adoption in research and education. To address this issue, we propose AirSwarm. AirSwarm democratizes multi-drone coordination using low-cost commercially available drones such as Tello or Anafi, enabling affordable swarm aerial robotics research and education. Key innovations include a hierarchical control architecture for reliable multi-UAV coordination, an infrastructure-free visual SLAM system for precise localization without external motion capture, and a ROS-based software framework for simplified swarm development. Experiments demonstrate cm-level tracking accuracy, low-latency control, communication failure resistance, formation flight, and trajectory tracking. By reducing financial and technical barriers, AirSwarm makes multi-robot education and research more accessible. The complete instructions and open source code will be available at</p></details> |  |
| **[OpenGV 2.0: Motion prior-assisted calibration and SLAM with vehicle-mounted surround-view systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03230v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The present paper proposes optimization-based solutions to visual SLAM with a vehicle-mounted surround-view camera system. Owing to their original use-case, such systems often only contain a single camera facing into either direction and very limited overlap between fields of view. Our novelty consist of three optimization modules targeting at practical online calibration of exterior orientations from simple two-view geometry, reliable front-end initialization of relative displacements, and accurate back-end optimization using a continuous-time trajectory model. The commonality between the proposed modules is given by the fact that all three of them exploit motion priors that are related to the inherent non-holonomic characteristics of passenger vehicle motion. In contrast to prior related art, the proposed modules furthermore excel in terms of bypassing partial unobservabilities in the transformation variables that commonly occur for Ackermann-motion. As a further contribution, the modules are built into a novel surround-view camera SLAM system that specifically targets deployment on Ackermann vehicles operating in urban environments. All modules are studied in the context of in-depth ablation studies, and the practical validity of the entire framework is supported by a successful application to challenging, large-scale publicly available online datasets. Note that upon acceptance, the entire framework is scheduled for open-source release as part of an extension of the OpenGV library.</p></details> |  |
| **[Monocular visual simultaneous localization and mapping: (r)evolution from geometry to deep learning-based pipelines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02955v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rise of deep learning, there is a fundamental change in visual SLAM algorithms toward developing different modules trained as end-to-end pipelines. However, regardless of the implementation domain, visual SLAM's performance is subject to diverse environmental challenges, such as dynamic elements in outdoor environments, harsh imaging conditions in underwater environments, or blurriness in high-speed setups. These environmental challenges need to be identified to study the real-world viability of SLAM implementations. Motivated by the aforementioned challenges, this paper surveys the current state of visual SLAM algorithms according to the two main frameworks: geometry-based and learning-based SLAM. First, we introduce a general formulation of the SLAM pipeline that includes most of the implementations in the literature. Second, those implementations are classified and surveyed for geometry and learning-based SLAM. After that, environment-specific challenges are formulated to enable experimental evaluation of the resilience of different visual SLAM classes to varying imaging conditions. We address two significant issues in surveying visual SLAM, providing (1) a consistent classification of visual SLAM pipelines and (2) a robust evaluation of their performance under different deployment conditions. Finally, we give our take on future opportunities for visual SLAM implementations.</p></details> |  |
| **[vS-Graphs: Integrating Visual SLAM and Situational Graphs through Multi-level Scene Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01783v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (VSLAM) systems often struggle to create maps that are both semantically rich and easily interpretable. While incorporating semantic scene knowledge aids in building richer maps with contextual associations among mapped objects, representing them in structured formats like scene graphs has not been widely addressed, encountering complex map comprehension and limited scalability. This paper introduces visual S-Graphs (vS-Graphs), a novel real-time VSLAM framework that integrates vision-based scene understanding with map reconstruction and comprehensible graph-based representation. The framework infers structural elements (i.e., rooms and corridors) from detected building components (i.e., walls and ground surfaces) and incorporates them into optimizable 3D scene graphs. This solution enhances the reconstructed map's semantic richness, comprehensibility, and localization accuracy. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks and real-world datasets demonstrate that vS-Graphs outperforms state-of-the-art VSLAM methods, reducing trajectory error by an average of 3.38% and up to 9.58% on real-world data. Furthermore, the proposed framework achieves environment-driven semantic entity detection accuracy comparable to precise LiDAR-based frameworks using only visual features.

| **[MUSt3R: Multi-view Network for Stereo 3D Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01661v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>DUSt3R introduced a novel paradigm in geometric computer vision by proposing a model that can provide dense and unconstrained Stereo 3D Reconstruction of arbitrary image collections with no prior information about camera calibration nor viewpoint poses. Under the hood, however, DUSt3R processes image pairs, regressing local 3D reconstructions that need to be aligned in a global coordinate system. The number of pairs, growing quadratically, is an inherent limitation that becomes especially concerning for robust and fast optimization in the case of large image collections. In this paper, we propose an extension of DUSt3R from pairs to multiple views, that addresses all aforementioned concerns. Indeed, we propose a Multi-view Network for Stereo 3D Reconstruction, or MUSt3R, that modifies the DUSt3R architecture by making it symmetric and extending it to directly predict 3D structure for all views in a common coordinate frame. Second, we entail the model with a multi-layer memory mechanism which allows to reduce the computational complexity and to scale the reconstruction to large collections, inferring thousands of 3D pointmaps at high frame-rates with limited added complexity. The framework is designed to perform 3D reconstruction both offline and online, and hence can be seamlessly applied to SfM and visual SLAM scenarios showing state-of-the-art performance on various 3D downstream tasks, including uncalibrated Visual Odometry, relative camera pose, scale and focal estimation, 3D reconstruction and multi-view depth estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2025</p></details> |

To address the ambiguity of this setup, we present HMD^2, a novel system that balances motion reconstruction and generation. From a reconstruction standpoint, it aims to maximally utilize the camera streams to produce both analytical and learned features, including head motion, SLAM point cloud, and image embeddings. On the generative front, HMD^2 employs a multi-modal conditional motion diffusion model with a Transformer backbone to maintain temporal coherence of generated motions, and utilizes autoregressive inpainting to facilitate online motion inference with minimal latency (0.17 seconds). We show that our system provides an effective and robust solution that scales to a diverse dataset of over 200 hours of motion in complex indoor and outdoor environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on 3D Vision 2025 (3DV 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Action-Consistent Decentralized Belief Space Planning with Inconsistent Beliefs and Limited Data Sharing: Framework and Simplification Algorithms with Formal Guarantees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05962v2)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In multi-robot systems, ensuring safe and reliable decision making under uncertain conditions demands robust multi-robot belief space planning (MR-BSP) algorithms. While planning with multiple robots, each robot maintains a belief over the state of the environment and reasons how the belief would evolve in the future for different possible actions. However, existing MR-BSP works have a common assumption that the beliefs of different robots are same at planning time. Such an assumption is often unrealistic as it requires prohibitively extensive and frequent data sharing capabilities. In practice, robots may have limited communication capabilities, and consequently beliefs of the robots can be different. Crucially, when the robots have inconsistent beliefs, the existing approaches could result in lack of coordination between the robots and may lead to unsafe decisions. In this paper, we present decentralized MR-BSP algorithms, with performance guarantees, for tackling this crucial gap. Our algorithms leverage the notion of action preferences. The base algorithm VerifyAC guarantees a consistent joint action selection by the cooperative robots via a three-step verification. When the verification succeeds, VerifyAC finds a consistent joint action without triggering a communication; otherwise it triggers a communication. We design an extended algorithm R-VerifyAC for further reducing the number of communications, by relaxing the criteria of action consistency. Another extension R-VerifyAC-simp builds on verifying a partial set of observations and improves the computation time significantly. The theoretical performance guarantees are corroborated with simulation results in discrete setting. Furthermore, we formulate our approaches for continuous and high-dimensional state and observation spaces, and provide experimental results for active multi-robot visual SLAM with real robots.</p></details> | <details><summary>The n...</summary><p>The new version has been extended from the existing arxiv version of the paper in the following way: - The old (base) algorithm VerifyAC has been retained in the new version. - Added two new algorithms R-VerifyAC and R-VerifyAC-simp along with their performance guarantees. - A new formulation in continuous spaces have been added. - Experimental results for the new approaches have been added</p></details> |
| **[AirSLAM: An Efficient and Illumination-Robust Point-Line Visual SLAM System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03520v4)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present an efficient visual SLAM system designed to tackle both short-term and long-term illumination challenges. Our system adopts a hybrid approach that combines deep learning techniques for feature detection and matching with traditional backend optimization methods. Specifically, we propose a unified convolutional neural network (CNN) that simultaneously extracts keypoints and structural lines. These features are then associated, matched, triangulated, and optimized in a coupled manner. Additionally, we introduce a lightweight relocalization pipeline that reuses the built map, where keypoints, lines, and a structure graph are used to match the query frame with the map. To enhance the applicability of the proposed system to real-world robots, we deploy and accelerate the feature detection and matching networks using C++ and NVIDIA TensorRT. Extensive experiments conducted on various datasets demonstrate that our system outperforms other state-of-the-art visual SLAM systems in illumination-challenging environments. Efficiency evaluations show that our system can run at a rate of 73Hz on a PC and 40Hz on an embedded platform. Our implementation is open-sourced: https://github.com/sair-lab/AirSLAM.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 15 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |
| **[Increasing the Task Flexibility of Heavy-Duty Manipulators Using Visual 6D Pose Estimation of Objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19169v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in visual 6D pose estimation of objects using deep neural networks have enabled novel ways of vision-based control for heavy-duty robotic applications. In this study, we present a pipeline for the precise tool positioning of heavy-duty, long-reach (HDLR) manipulators using advanced machine vision. A camera is utilized in the so-called eye-in-hand configuration to estimate directly the poses of a tool and a target object of interest (OOI). Based on the pose error between the tool and the target, along with motion-based calibration between the camera and the robot, precise tool positioning can be reliably achieved using conventional robotic modeling and control methods prevalent in the industry. The proposed methodology comprises orientation and position alignment based on the visually estimated OOI poses, whereas camera-to-robot calibration is conducted based on motion utilizing visual SLAM. The methods seek to avert the inaccuracies resulting from rigid-body--based kinematics of structurally flexible HDLR manipulators via image-based algorithms. To train deep neural networks for OOI pose estimation, only synthetic data are utilized. The methods are validated in a real-world setting using an HDLR manipulator with a 5 m reach. The experimental results demonstrate that an image-based average tool positioning error of less than 2 mm along the non-depth axes is achieved, which facilitates a new way to increase the task flexibility and automation level of non-rigid HDLR manipulators.</p></details> |  |

However, thermal imaging faces challenges like low contrast, high noise, and limited large-scale annotated datasets, restricting the use of deep learning in outdoor scenarios. We present DarkSLAM, a noval deep learning-based monocular thermal SLAM system designed for large-scale localization and reconstruction in complex lighting conditions.Our approach incorporates the Efficient Channel Attention (ECA) mechanism in visual odometry and the Selective Kernel Attention (SKA) mechanism in depth estimation to enhance pose accuracy and mitigate thermal depth degradation. Additionally, the system includes thermal depth-based loop closure detection and pose optimization, ensuring robust performance in low-texture thermal scenes. Extensive outdoor experiments demonstrate that DarkSLAM significantly outperforms existing methods like SC-Sfm-Learner and Shin et al., delivering precise localization and 3D dense mapping even in challenging nighttime environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[GSORB-SLAM: Gaussian Splatting SLAM benefits from ORB features and Transmittance information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11356v3)** | 2025-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently ignited a renewed wave of research in dense visual SLAM. However, existing approaches encounter challenges, including sensitivity to artifacts and noise, suboptimal selection of training viewpoints, and the absence of global optimization. In this paper, we propose GSORB-SLAM, a dense SLAM framework that integrates 3DGS with ORB features through a tightly coupled optimization pipeline. To mitigate the effects of noise and artifacts, we propose a novel geometric representation and optimization method for tracking, which significantly enhances localization accuracy and robustness. For high-fidelity mapping, we develop an adaptive Gaussian expansion and regularization method that facilitates compact yet expressive scene modeling while suppressing redundant primitives. Furthermore, we design a hybrid graph-based viewpoint selection mechanism that effectively reduces overfitting and accelerates convergence. Extensive evaluations across various datasets demonstrate that our system achieves state-of-the-art performance in both tracking precision-improving RMSE by 16.2% compared to ORB-SLAM2 baselines-and reconstruction quality-improving PSNR by 3.93 dB compared to 3DGS-SLAM baselines.

Despite the strong progress in this field, there are still challenging situations in which established methods fail. We present an approach to significantly improve the accuracy and reliability of established visual localization methods by adding rendered images. In detail, we first use a modern visual SLAM approach that provides a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) based map to create reference data. We demonstrate that enriching reference data with images rendered from 3DGS at randomly sampled poses significantly improves the performance of both geometry-based visual localization and Scene Coordinate Regression (SCR) methods. Through comprehensive evaluation in a large industrial environment, we analyze the performance impact of incorporating these additional rendered views.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a novel active illumination framework to enhance the performance of VO and V-SLAM algorithms in these challenging conditions. The developed approach dynamically controls a moving light source to illuminate highly textured areas, thereby improving feature extraction and tracking. Specifically, a detector block, which incorporates a deep learning-based enhancing network, identifies regions with relevant features. Then, a pan-tilt controller is responsible for guiding the light beam toward these areas, so that to provide information-rich images to the ego-motion estimation algorithm. Experimental results on a real robotic platform demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, showing a reduction in the pose estimation error up to 75% with respect to a traditional fixed lighting technique.</p></details> |  |

While extensive research has explored 3DGS for indoor trajectory tracking using visual sensor alone or in combination with Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), its integration with GNSS for large-scale outdoor navigation remains underexplored. To address these concerns, we proposed GS-GVINS: a tightly-integrated GNSS-Visual-Inertial Navigation System augmented by 3DGS. This system leverages 3D Gaussian as a continuous differentiable scene representation in largescale outdoor environments, enhancing navigation performance through the constructed 3D Gaussian map. Notably, GS-GVINS is the first GNSS-Visual-Inertial navigation application that directly utilizes the analytical jacobians of SE3 camera pose with respect to 3D Gaussians. To maintain the quality of 3DGS rendering in extreme dynamic states, we introduce a motionaware 3D Gaussian pruning mechanism, updating the map based on relative pose translation and the accumulated opacity along the camera ray. For validation, we test our system under different driving environments: open-sky, sub-urban, and urban. Both self-collected and public datasets are used for evaluation. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of GS-GVINS in enhancing navigation accuracy across diverse driving environments.</p></details> |  |

Our FLAF-based visual navigation is built upon a feature-based visual teach and repeat (VT\&R) framework, which supports many robotic applications by teaching a robot to navigate on various paths that cover a significant portion of daily autonomous navigation requirements. However, tracking failure in feature-based visual simultaneous localization and mapping (VSLAM) caused by textureless regions in human-made environments is still limiting VT\&R to be adopted in the real world. To address this problem, the proposed view planner is integrated into a feature-based visual SLAM system to build up an active VT\&R system that avoids tracking failure. In our system, a pan-tilt unit (PTU)-based active camera is mounted on the mobile robot. Using FLAF, the active camera-based VSLAM operates during the teaching phase to construct a complete path map and in the repeat phase to maintain stable localization. FLAF orients the robot toward more map points to avoid mapping failures during path learning and toward more feature-identifiable map points beneficial for localization while following the learned trajectory. Experiments in real scenarios demonstrate that FLAF outperforms the methods that do not consider feature-identifiability, and our active VT\&R system performs well in complex environments by effectively dealing with low-texture regions.</p></details> |  |

Such scene representations should be both, geometrically accurate and photorealistic to support downstream tasks. While this can be achieved by building distance fields from range sensors and radiance fields from cameras, the scalable incremental mapping of both fields consistently and at the same time with high quality remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel map representation that unifies a continuous signed distance field and a Gaussian splatting radiance field within an elastic and compact point-based implicit neural map. By enforcing geometric consistency between these fields, we achieve mutual improvements by exploiting both modalities. We devise a LiDAR-visual SLAM system called PINGS using the proposed map representation and evaluate it on several challenging large-scale datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that PINGS can incrementally build globally consistent distance and radiance fields encoded with a compact set of neural points. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, PINGS achieves superior photometric and geometric rendering at novel views by leveraging the constraints from the distance field. Furthermore, by utilizing dense photometric cues and multi-view consistency from the radiance field, PINGS produces more accurate distance fields, leading to improved odometry estimation and mesh reconstruction.</p></details> | 14 pages, 8 figures |

Traditional approaches require careful manual tuning and incur substantial computational overhead, while learning-based methods either lack explicit loop closure capabilities or implement them through computationally expensive methods. We present AutoLoop, a novel approach that combines automated curriculum learning with efficient fine-tuning for visual SLAM systems. Our method employs a DDPG (Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient) agent to dynamically adjust loop closure weights during training, eliminating the need for manual hyperparameter search while significantly reducing the required training steps. The approach pre-computes potential loop closure pairs offline and leverages them through an agent-guided curriculum, allowing the model to adapt efficiently to new scenarios. Experiments conducted on TartanAir for training and validated across multiple benchmarks including KITTI, EuRoC, ICL-NUIM and TUM RGB-D demonstrate that AutoLoop achieves comparable or superior performance while reducing training time by an order of magnitude compared to traditional approaches. AutoLoop provides a practical solution for rapid adaptation of visual SLAM systems, automating the weight tuning process that traditionally requires multiple manual iterations. Our results show that this automated curriculum strategy not only accelerates training but also maintains or improves the model's performance across diverse environmental conditions.</p></details> |  |

Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is a prominent solution to this problem. SLAM is a framework that consists of a diverse set of computational tasks ranging from real-time tracking to computation-intensive map optimization. This combination can present a challenge for resource-limited mobile robots. Previously, edge-assisted SLAM methods have demonstrated promising real-time execution capabilities by offloading heavy computations while performing real-time tracking onboard. However, the common approach of utilizing a client-server architecture for offloading is sensitive to server and network failures. In this article, we propose a novel edge-assisted SLAM framework capable of self-organizing fully distributed SLAM execution across a network of devices or functioning on a single device without connectivity. The architecture consists of three layers and is designed to be device-agnostic, resilient to network failures, and minimally invasive to the core SLAM system. We have implemented and demonstrated the framework for monocular ORB SLAM3 and evaluated it in both fully distributed and standalone SLAM configurations against the ORB SLAM3. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed design matches the accuracy and resource utilization of the monolithic approach while enabling collaborative execution.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

However, tracking loss can lead to the creation of disjoint submaps in multimap SLAM systems like ORB-SLAM3. Because of that, these systems employ submap merging strategies. As we show, these strategies are not always successful. In this paper, we investigate the impact of using modern VPR approaches for submap merging in visual SLAM. We argue that classical evaluation metrics are not sufficient to estimate the impact of a modern VPR component on the overall system. We show that naively replacing the VPR component does not leverage its full potential without requiring substantial interference in the original system. Because of that, we present a post-processing pipeline along with a set of metrics that allow us to estimate the impact of modern VPR components. We evaluate our approach on the NCLT and Newer College datasets using ORB-SLAM3 with NetVLAD and HDC-DELF as VPR components. Additionally, we present a simple approach for combining VPR with temporal consistency for map merging. We show that the map merging performance of ORB-SLAM3 can be improved. Building on these results, researchers in VPR can assess the potential of their approaches for SLAM systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at TAROS 2024.

Traditional Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) and Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (VSLAM) methods, though adequate for local pose estimation, suffer from drift in the long term due to reliance on local sensor data. While GPS counteracts this drift, it is unavailable indoors and often unreliable in urban areas. An alternative is to localize the camera to an existing 3D map using visual-feature matching. This can provide centimeter-level accurate localization but is limited by the visual similarities between the current view and the map. This paper introduces a novel approach that achieves accurate and globally-consistent localization by aligning the sparse 3D point cloud generated by the VIO/VSLAM system to a digital twin using point-to-plane matching; no visual data association is needed. The proposed method provides a 6-DoF global measurement tightly integrated into the VIO/VSLAM system. Experiments run on a high-fidelity GPS simulator and real-world data collected from a drone demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art VIO-GPS systems and offers superior robustness against viewpoint changes compared to the state-of-the-art Visual SLAM systems.</p></details> |  |

Most conventional structure from motion and monocular SLAM techniques assume input videos that feature predominantly static scenes with large amounts of parallax. Such methods tend to produce erroneous estimates in the absence of these conditions. Recent neural network-based approaches attempt to overcome these challenges; however, such methods are either computationally expensive or brittle when run on dynamic videos with uncontrolled camera motion or unknown field of view. We demonstrate the surprising effectiveness of a deep visual SLAM framework: with careful modifications to its training and inference schemes, this system can scale to real-world videos of complex dynamic scenes with unconstrained camera paths, including videos with little camera parallax. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real videos demonstrate that our system is significantly more accurate and robust at camera pose and depth estimation when compared with prior and concurrent work, with faster or comparable running times.

Ground-Truth-Free Tuning of Structure from Motion and Visual SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01116v1)** | 2024-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluation is critical to both developing and tuning Structure from Motion (SfM) and Visual SLAM (VSLAM) systems, but is universally reliant on high-quality geometric ground truth -- a resource that is not only costly and time-intensive but, in many cases, entirely unobtainable. This dependency on ground truth restricts SfM and SLAM applications across diverse environments and limits scalability to real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose a novel ground-truth-free (GTF) evaluation methodology that eliminates the need for geometric ground truth, instead using sensitivity estimation via sampling from both original and noisy versions of input images. Our approach shows strong correlation with traditional ground-truth-based benchmarks and supports GTF hyperparameter tuning. Removing the need for ground truth opens up new opportunities to leverage a much larger number of dataset sources, and for self-supervised and online tuning, with the potential for a data-driven breakthrough analogous to what has occurred in generative AI.</p></details> |  |

However, reconstructing thin structures of indoor scenes while ensuring real-time performance remains a challenge for dense visual SLAM systems. Previous methods do not consider varying quality of input RGB-D data and employ fixed-frequency mapping process to reconstruct the scene, which could result in the loss of valuable information in some frames. In this paper, we propose Uni-SLAM, a decoupled 3D spatial representation based on hash grids for indoor reconstruction. We introduce a novel defined predictive uncertainty to reweight the loss function, along with strategic local-to-global bundle adjustment. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our system achieves state-of-the-art tracking and mapping accuracy while maintaining real-time performance. It significantly improves over current methods with a 25% reduction in depth L1 error and a 66.86% completion rate within 1 cm on the Replica dataset, reflecting a more accurate reconstruction of thin structures.

It incorporates appearance, geometry, and semantic features through multi-channel optimization, addressing the oversmoothing limitations of neural implicit SLAM systems in high-quality rendering, scene understanding, and object-level geometry. We introduce a unique semantic feature loss that effectively compensates for the shortcomings of traditional depth and color losses in object optimization. Through a semantic-guided keyframe selection strategy, we prevent erroneous reconstructions caused by cumulative errors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SGS-SLAM delivers state-of-the-art performance in camera pose estimation, map reconstruction, precise semantic segmentation, and object-level geometric accuracy, while ensuring real-time rendering capabilities.</p></details> |  |

Notably, LiV-GS is the first method that directly aligns discrete and sparse LiDAR data with continuous differentiable Gaussian maps in large-scale outdoor scenes, overcoming the limitation of fixed resolution in traditional LiDAR mapping. The system aligns point clouds with Gaussian maps using shared covariance attributes for front-end tracking and integrates the normal orientation into the loss function to refines the Gaussian map. To reliably and stably update Gaussians outside the LiDAR field of view, we introduce a novel conditional Gaussian constraint that aligns these Gaussians closely with the nearest reliable ones. The targeted adjustment enables LiV-GS to achieve fast and accurate mapping with novel view synthesis at a rate of 7.98 FPS. Extensive comparative experiments demonstrate LiV-GS's superior performance in SLAM, image rendering and mapping. The successful cross-modal radar-LiDAR localization highlights the potential of LiV-GS for applications in cross-modal semantic positioning and object segmentation with Gaussian maps.</p></details> |  |

Recent advancements integrating Gaussian Splatting into SLAM systems have proven effective in creating high-quality renderings using explicit 3D Gaussian models, significantly improving environmental reconstruction fidelity. However, these approaches depend on a static environment assumption and face challenges in dynamic environments due to inconsistent observations of geometry and photometry. To address this problem, we propose DG-SLAM, the first robust dynamic visual SLAM system grounded in 3D Gaussians, which provides precise camera pose estimation alongside high-fidelity reconstructions. Specifically, we propose effective strategies, including motion mask generation, adaptive Gaussian point management, and a hybrid camera tracking algorithm to improve the accuracy and robustness of pose estimation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DG-SLAM delivers state-of-the-art performance in camera pose estimation, map reconstruction, and novel-view synthesis in dynamic scenes, outperforming existing methods meanwhile preserving real-time rendering ability.</p></details> |  |
| **[MBA-SLAM: Motion Blur Aware Dense Visual SLAM with Radiance Fields Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08279v1)** | 2024-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Emerging 3D scene representations, such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have demonstrated their effectiveness in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) for photo-realistic rendering, particularly when using high-quality video sequences as input. However, existing methods struggle with motion-blurred frames, which are common in real-world scenarios like low-light or long-exposure conditions. This often results in a significant reduction in both camera localization accuracy and map reconstruction quality. To address this challenge, we propose a dense visual SLAM pipeline (i.e. MBA-SLAM) to handle severe motion-blurred inputs. Our approach integrates an efficient motion blur-aware tracker with either neural radiance fields or Gaussian Splatting based mapper. By accurately modeling the physical image formation process of motion-blurred images, our method simultaneously learns 3D scene representation and estimates the cameras' local trajectory during exposure time, enabling proactive compensation for motion blur caused by camera movement. In our experiments, we demonstrate that MBA-SLAM surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods in both camera localization and map reconstruction, showcasing superior performance across a range of datasets, including synthetic and real datasets featuring sharp images as well as those affected by motion blur, highlighting the versatility and robustness of our approach.

However, these algorithms are application-specific and do not work across applications with different types of motion; even a tracking algorithm designed for a given application does not work in scenarios deviating from highly standard conditions. For example, a tracking algorithm designed for robot navigation inside a building will not work for tracking the same robot in an outdoor environment. To demonstrate this problem, we evaluate the performance of the state-of-the-art tracking methods across various applications and scenarios. To inform our analysis, we first categorize algorithmic, environmental, and locomotion-related challenges faced by tracking algorithms. We quantitatively evaluate the performance using multiple tracking algorithms and representative datasets for a wide range of Internet of Things (IoT) and Extended Reality (XR) applications, including autonomous vehicles, drones, and humans. Our analysis shows that no tracking algorithm works across different applications and scenarios within applications. Ultimately, using the insights generated from our analysis, we discuss multiple approaches to improving the tracking performance using input data characterization, leveraging intermediate information, and output evaluation.</p></details> |  |

However, generating these maps in complex environments, such as multi-level parking garages or shopping malls, remains a formidable challenge. In this paper, we introduce a participatory sensing approach that delegates map-building tasks to map users, thereby enabling cost-effective and continuous data collection. The proposed method harnesses the collective efforts of users, facilitating the expansion and ongoing update of the maps as the environment evolves. We realized this approach by developing Map++, an efficient system that functions as a plug-and-play extension, supporting participatory map-building based on existing SLAM algorithms. Map++ addresses a plethora of scalability issues in this participatory map-building system by proposing a set of lightweight, application-layer protocols. We evaluated Map++ in four representative settings: an indoor garage, an outdoor plaza, a public SLAM benchmark, and a simulated environment. The results demonstrate that Map++ can reduce traffic volume by approximately 46% with negligible degradation in mapping accuracy, i.e., less than 0.03m compared to the baseline system. It can support approximately $2 \times$ as many concurrent users as the baseline under the same network bandwidth. Additionally, for users who travel on already-mapped trajectories, they can directly utilize the existing maps for localization and save 47% of the CPU usage.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 15 figures.

While Monocular Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (MVSLAM) has emerged as a promising solution, its implementation in endoscopic procedures faces significant challenges due to hardware limitations, such as the use of a monocular camera and the absence of odometry sensors. This study presents BodySLAM, a robust deep learning-based MVSLAM approach that addresses these challenges through three key components: CycleVO, a novel unsupervised monocular pose estimation module; the integration of the state-of-the-art Zoe architecture for monocular depth estimation; and a 3D reconstruction module creating a coherent surgical map. The approach is rigorously evaluated using three publicly available datasets (Hamlyn, EndoSLAM, and SCARED) spanning laparoscopy, gastroscopy, and colonoscopy scenarios, and benchmarked against four state-of-the-art methods. Results demonstrate that CycleVO exhibited competitive performance with the lowest inference time among pose estimation methods, while maintaining robust generalization capabilities, whereas Zoe significantly outperformed existing algorithms for depth estimation in endoscopy. BodySLAM's strong performance across diverse endoscopic scenarios demonstrates its potential as a viable MVSLAM solution for endoscopic applications.</p></details> | 16 pages, 7 figures |

In general, they heavily rely on global visual similarity matching. However, the ambiguous similarity interference in uncertain regions could often lead to excessive noise in correspondences, ultimately misleading SLAM in geometric modeling. To address this issue, we propose a Learnable Gaussian Uncertainty (LGU) matching. It mainly focuses on precise correspondence construction. In our scheme, a learnable 2D Gaussian uncertainty model is designed to associate matching-frame pairs. It could generate input-dependent Gaussian distributions for each correspondence map. Additionally, a multi-scale deformable correlation sampling strategy is devised to adaptively fine-tune the sampling of each direction by a priori look-up ranges, enabling reliable correlation construction. Furthermore, a KAN-bias GRU component is adopted to improve a temporal iterative enhancement for accomplishing sophisticated spatio-temporal modeling with limited parameters. The extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets are conducted to validate the effectiveness and superiority of our method.</p></details> |  |

While VSLAM research has achieved significant advancements, its robustness under challenging situations, such as poor lighting, dynamic environments, motion blur, and sensor failures, remains a challenging issue. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel RGB-D dataset designed for evaluating the robustness of VSLAM systems. The dataset comprises real-world indoor scenes with dynamic objects, motion blur, and varying illumination, as well as emulated camera failures, including lens dirt, condensation, underexposure, and overexposure. Additionally, we offer open-source scripts for injecting camera failures into any images, enabling further customization by the research community. Our experiments demonstrate that ORB-SLAM2, a traditional VSLAM algorithm, and TartanVO, a Deep Learning-based VO algorithm, can experience performance degradation under these challenging conditions. Therefore, this dataset and the camera failure open-source tools provide a valuable resource for developing more robust VSLAM systems capable of handling real-world challenges.</p></details> | 6 pages |

Of the various thermal comfort indicators, the mean radiant temperature (MRT) is very challenging to measure. Most common measurement methodologies are time-consuming and not user-friendly. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel MRT measurement framework that uses visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and semantic segmentation techniques. The proposed approach follows the rule of thumb of the traditional MRT calculation method using surface temperature and view factors. However, it employs visual SLAM and creates a 3D thermal point cloud with enriched surface temperature information. The framework then implements Grounded SAM, a new object detection and segmentation tool to extract features with distinct temperature profiles on building surfaces. The detailed segmentation of thermal features not only reduces potential errors in the calculation of the MRT but also provides an efficient reconstruction of the spatial MRT distribution in the indoor environment. We also validate the calculation results with the reference measurement methodology. This data-driven framework offers faster and more efficient MRT measurements and spatial mapping than conventional methods. It can enable the direct engagement of researchers and practitioners in MRT measurements and contribute to research on thermal comfort and radiant cooling and heating systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2024 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshop</p></details> |

To this end, one of the key challenges is cross-modal place recognition, which involves retrieving 3D scenes (point clouds) from a LiDAR map according to online RGB images. In this paper, we introduce an efficient framework to learn descriptors for both RGB images and point clouds. It takes visual state space model (VMamba) as the backbone and employs a pixel-view-scene joint training strategy for cross-modal contrastive learning. To address the field-of-view differences, independent descriptors are generated from multiple evenly distributed viewpoints for point clouds. A visible 3D points overlap strategy is then designed to quantify the similarity between point cloud views and RGB images for multi-view supervision. Additionally, when generating descriptors from pixel-level features using NetVLAD, we compensate for the loss of geometric information, and introduce an efficient scheme for multi-view generation. Experimental results on the KITTI and KITTI-360 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our method. The code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

However, these approaches are built on a tremendous number of redundant 3D Gaussian ellipsoids, leading to high memory and storage costs, and slow training speed. To address the limitation, we propose a compact 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM system that reduces the number and the parameter size of Gaussian ellipsoids. A sliding window-based masking strategy is first proposed to reduce the redundant ellipsoids. Then we observe that the covariance matrix (geometry) of most 3D Gaussian ellipsoids are extremely similar, which motivates a novel geometry codebook to compress 3D Gaussian geometric attributes, i.e., the parameters. Robust and accurate pose estimation is achieved by a global bundle adjustment method with reprojection loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves faster training and rendering speed while maintaining the state-of-the-art (SOTA) quality of the scene representation.</p></details> |  |

| **[Addressing the challenges of loop detection in agricultural environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15761v2)** | 2024-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While visual SLAM systems are well studied and achieve impressive results in indoor and urban settings, natural, outdoor and open-field environments are much less explored and still present relevant research challenges. Visual navigation and local mapping have shown a relatively good performance in open-field environments. However, globally consistent mapping and long-term localization still depend on the robustness of loop detection and closure, for which the literature is scarce. In this work we propose a novel method to pave the way towards robust loop detection in open fields, particularly in agricultural settings, based on local feature search and stereo geometric refinement, with a final stage of relative pose estimation. Our method consistently achieves good loop detections, with a median error of 15cm. We aim to characterize open fields as a novel environment for loop detection, understanding the limitations and problems that arise when dealing with them.</p></details> |  |

The method consists of two steps: visual perception and path planning. The visual perception part uses ORBSLAM3 enhanced with optical flow to estimate the car's poses and extract rich texture information from the scene. In the path planning phase, we employ a method combining a control Lyapunov function and control barrier function in the form of quadratic program (CLF-CBF-QP) together with an obstacle shape reconstruction process (SRP) to plan safe and stable trajectories. To validate the performance and robustness of the proposed method, simulation experiments were conducted with a car in various complex indoor environments using the Gazebo simulation environment. Our method can effectively avoid obstacles in the scenes. The proposed algorithm outperforms benchmark algorithms in achieving more stable and shorter trajectories across multiple simulated scenes.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages; Submitted to a journal</p></details> |
| **[Visual SLAM with 3D Gaussian Primitives and Depth Priors Enabling Novel View Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05635v2)** | 2024-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional geometry-based SLAM systems lack dense 3D reconstruction capabilities since their data association usually relies on feature correspondences. Additionally, learning-based SLAM systems often fall short in terms of real-time performance and accuracy. Balancing real-time performance with dense 3D reconstruction capabilities is a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a real-time RGB-D SLAM system that incorporates a novel view synthesis technique, 3D Gaussian Splatting, for 3D scene representation and pose estimation. This technique leverages the real-time rendering performance of 3D Gaussian Splatting with rasterization and allows for differentiable optimization in real time through CUDA implementation. We also enable mesh reconstruction from 3D Gaussians for explicit dense 3D reconstruction. To estimate accurate camera poses, we utilize a rotation-translation decoupled strategy with inverse optimization. This involves iteratively updating both in several iterations through gradient-based optimization. This process includes differentiably rendering RGB, depth, and silhouette maps and updating the camera parameters to minimize a combined loss of photometric loss, depth geometry loss, and visibility loss, given the existing 3D Gaussian map. However, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) struggles to accurately represent surfaces due to the multi-view inconsistency of 3D Gaussians, which can lead to reduced accuracy in both camera pose estimation and scene reconstruction. To address this, we utilize depth priors as additional regularization to enforce geometric constraints, thereby improving the accuracy of both pose estimation and 3D reconstruction. We also provide extensive experimental results on public benchmark datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods in terms of pose accuracy, geometric accuracy, and rendering performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[DynaPix SLAM: A Pixel-Based Dynamic Visual SLAM Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09879v2)** | 2024-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (V-SLAM) methods achieve remarkable performance in static environments, but face challenges in dynamic scenes where moving objects severely affect their core modules. To avoid this, dynamic V-SLAM approaches often leverage semantic information, geometric constraints, or optical flow. However, these methods are limited by imprecise estimations and their reliance on the accuracy of deep-learning models. Moreover, predefined thresholds for static/dynamic classification, the a-priori selection of dynamic object classes, and the inability to recognize unknown or unexpected moving objects, often degrade their performance. To address these limitations, we introduce DynaPix, a novel semantic-free V-SLAM system based on per-pixel motion probability estimation and an improved pose optimization process. The per-pixel motion probability is estimated using a static background differencing method on image data and optical flows computed on splatted frames. With DynaPix, we fully integrate these probabilities into map point selection and apply them through weighted bundle adjustment within the tracking and optimization modules of ORB-SLAM2. We thoroughly evaluate our method using the GRADE and TUM RGB-D datasets, showing significantly lower trajectory errors and longer tracking times in both static and dynamic sequences. The source code, datasets, and results are available at https://dynapix.is.tue.mpg.de/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Cheng...</summary><p>Chenghao Xu and Elia Bonetto contributed equally to this work as first authors. 19 pages, 4 tables, 6 figures.

| **[Advancements in Translation Accuracy for Stereo Visual-Inertial Initialization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15082v4)** | 2024-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the current initialization method in the state-of-the-art Stereo Visual-Inertial SLAM framework, ORB-SLAM3 has limitations. Its success depends on the performance of the pure stereo SLAM system and is based on the underlying assumption that pure visual SLAM can accurately estimate the camera trajectory, which is essential for inertial parameter estimation. Meanwhile, the further improved initialization method for ORB-SLAM3, known as Stereo-NEC, is time-consuming due to applying keypoint tracking to estimate gyroscope bias with normal epipolar constraints. To address the limitations of previous methods, this paper proposes a method aimed at enhancing translation accuracy during the initialization stage. The fundamental concept of our method is to improve the translation estimate with a 3 Degree-of-Freedom (DoF) Bundle Adjustment (BA), independently, while the rotation estimate is fixed, instead of using ORB-SLAM3's 6-DoF BA. Additionally, the rotation estimate will be updated by considering IMU measurements and gyroscope bias, unlike ORB-SLAM3's rotation, which is directly obtained from stereo visual odometry and may yield inferior results when operating in challenging scenarios. We also conduct extensive evaluations on the public benchmark, the EuRoC dataset, demonstrating that our method excels in accuracy.</p></details> |  |

It determines the pose of a camera sensor by robustly associating the object detections in the current frame with 3D objects in a lightweight object-level map. Object graphs, considering semantic uncertainties, are constructed for both the incoming camera frame and the pre-built map. Objects are represented as graph nodes, and each node employs unique semantic descriptors based on our devised graph kernels. We extract a subgraph from the target map graph by identifying potential object associations for each object detection, then refine these associations and pose estimations using a RANSAC-inspired strategy. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate that our method achieves more accurate data association and significantly increases relocalization success rates compared to baseline methods. The implementation of our method is released at \url{https://github.com/yutongwangBIT/GOReloc}.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, accepted by IEEE RAL</p></details> |

Despite excellent accuracy, however, such approaches are often expensive to run or do not generalize well zero-shot. Their runtime can also fluctuate wildly while their frontend and backend fight for access to GPU resources. To address these problems, we introduce Deep Patch Visual (DPV) SLAM, a method for monocular visual SLAM on a single GPU. DPV-SLAM maintains a high minimum framerate and small memory overhead (5-7G) compared to existing deep SLAM systems. On real-world datasets, DPV-SLAM runs at 1x-4x real-time framerates. We achieve comparable accuracy to DROID-SLAM on EuRoC and TartanAir while running 2.5x faster using a fraction of the memory. DPV-SLAM is an extension to the DPVO visual odometry system; its code can be found in the same repository: https://github.com/princeton-vl/DPVO</p></details> |  |

This capability is crucial for mobile robots to have reliable navigation, build accurate maps, and have precise behaviors around human collaborators. This paper focuses on the development of robust short-term relocalization capabilities for mobile robots using a monocular camera system. A novel multimodal keyframe descriptor is introduced, that contains semantic information of objects detected in the environment and the spatial information of the camera. Using this descriptor, a new Keyframe-based Place Recognition (KPR) method is proposed that is formulated as a multi-stage keyframe filtering algorithm, leading to a new relocalization pipeline for MKVSLAM systems. The proposed approach is evaluated over several indoor GPS denied datasets and demonstrates accurate pose recovery, in comparison to a bag-of-words approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, Keywords: VSLAM, Localization, Semantics.

However, the presence of inaccuracies in these depth images can greatly hinder the effectiveness of these applications, resulting in sub-optimal results. Depth images produced by commercially available cameras frequently exhibit noise, which manifests as flickering pixels and erroneous patches. ML-based methods to rectify these images are unsuitable for edge devices that have very limited computational resources. Non-ML methods are much faster but have limited accuracy, especially for correcting errors that are a result of occlusion and camera movement. We propose a scheme called VoxDepth that is fast, accurate, and runs very well on edge devices. It relies on a host of novel techniques: 3D point cloud construction and fusion, and using it to create a template that can fix erroneous depth images. VoxDepth shows superior results on both synthetic and real-world datasets. We demonstrate a 31% improvement in quality as compared to state-of-the-art methods on real-world depth datasets, while maintaining a competitive framerate of 27 FPS (frames per second).</p></details> |  |

Casual video captures often suffer from motion blur and varying appearances, which degrade the final quality of coherent 3D visual representation. We propose integrating the physical imaging into the SLAM system, which employs linear HDR radiance maps to collect measurements. Specifically, individual frames aggregate images of multiple poses along the camera trajectory to explain prevalent motion blur in hand-held videos. Additionally, we accommodate per-frame appearance variation by dedicating explicit variables for image formation steps, namely white balance, exposure time, and camera response function. Through joint optimization of additional variables, the SLAM pipeline produces high-quality images with more accurate trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach can be incorporated into recent visual SLAM pipelines using various scene representations, such as neural radiance fields or Gaussian splatting.</p></details> | ECCV 2024 |

RGB-based scene-level semantic segmentation has been well-addressed in the literature.

To this end, we propose a complementarity-aware deep learning approach for RGB-D-based material classification built on top of an object-oriented pipeline. The approach further integrates the ORB-SLAM2 method for 3D scene mapping with multiscale clustering of the detected material semantics in the point cloud map generated by the visual SLAM algorithm.

Addressing these challenges, our research introduces AVM-SLAM, a cutting-edge semantic visual SLAM architecture with multi-sensor fusion in a bird's eye view (BEV). This novel framework synergizes the capabilities of four fisheye cameras, wheel encoders, and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) to construct a robust SLAM system. Unique to our approach is the implementation of a flare removal technique within the BEV imagery, significantly enhancing road marking detection and semantic feature extraction by convolutional neural networks for superior mapping and localization. Our work also pioneers a semantic pre-qualification (SPQ) module, designed to adeptly handle the challenges posed by environments with repetitive textures, thereby enhancing loop detection and system robustness.

In our work, we employ dictionary factors for scene representation, encoding the geometry and appearance information of the scene as a combination of basis and coefficient factors. Compared to neural implicit dense visual SLAM methods that directly encode scene information as features, our method exhibits superior scene detail reconstruction capabilities and more efficient memory usage, while our model size is insensitive to the size of the scene map, making our method more suitable for large-scale scenes. Additionally, we employ feature integration rendering to accelerate color rendering speed while ensuring color rendering quality, further enhancing the real-time performance of our neural SLAM method. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method is competitive with existing state-of-the-art neural implicit SLAM methods in terms of real-time performance, localization accuracy, and scene reconstruction quality.

Although deep learning-based local features excel at capturing high-level information and perform well on matching benchmarks, they struggle with generalization in continuous motion scenes, adversely affecting loop detection accuracy. Our system employs a Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) strategy to optimize the training of keypoint extraction networks, enhancing their adaptability to diverse environments. Additionally, we introduce a coarse-to-fine feature tracking mechanism for learned keypoints. It begins with a direct method to approximate the relative pose between consecutive frames, followed by a feature matching method for refined pose estimation. To mitigate cumulative positioning errors, DK-SLAM incorporates a novel online learning module that utilizes binary features for loop closure detection. This module dynamically identifies loop nodes within a sequence, ensuring accurate and efficient localization. Experimental evaluations on publicly available datasets demonstrate that DK-SLAM outperforms leading traditional and learning based SLAM systems, such as ORB-SLAM3 and LIFT-SLAM. These results underscore the efficacy and robustness of our DK-SLAM in varied and challenging real-world environments.</p></details> | In submission |

A probabilistic interpretation of the SLAM task allows for incorporating prior knowledge and for operation under uncertainty. Contrary to the common practice of computing point estimates of the system states, we capture the full posterior density through approximate Bayesian inference. This dynamic learning task falls under state estimation, where the state-of-the-art is in sequential Monte Carlo methods that tackle the forward filtering problem. In this paper, we introduce a framework for probabilistic SLAM using particle smoothing that does not only incorporate observed data in current state estimates, but it also back-tracks the updated knowledge to correct for past drift and ambiguities in both the map and in the states. Our solution can efficiently handle both dense and sparse map representations by Rao-Blackwellization of conditionally linear and conditionally linearized models. We show through simulations and real-world experiments how the principles apply to radio (BLE/Wi-Fi), magnetic field, and visual SLAM. The proposed solution is general, efficient, and works well under confounding noise.</p></details> | 23 pages, 7 figures |

However, human colonoscopies pose formidable challenges like occlusions, blur, light changes, lack of texture, deformation, water jets or tool interaction, which result in very frequent tracking losses. ORB-SLAM3, the top performing multiple-map V-SLAM, is unable to recover from them by merging sub-maps or relocalizing the camera, due to the poor performance of its place recognition algorithm based on ORB features and DBoW2 bag-of-words. We present CudaSIFT-SLAM, the first V-SLAM system able to process complete human colonoscopies in real-time. To overcome the limitations of ORB-SLAM3, we use SIFT instead of ORB features and replace the DBoW2 direct index with the more computationally demanding brute-force matching, being able to successfully match images separated in time for relocation and map merging. Real-time performance is achieved thanks to CudaSIFT, a GPU implementation for SIFT extraction and brute-force matching. We benchmark our system in the C3VD phantom colon dataset, and in a full real colonoscopy from the Endomapper dataset, demonstrating the capabilities to merge sub-maps and relocate in them, obtaining significantly longer sub-maps. Our system successfully maps in real-time 88 % of the frames in the C3VD dataset. In a real screening colonoscopy, despite the much higher prevalence of occluded and blurred frames, the mapping coverage is 53 % in carefully explored areas and 38 % in the full sequence, a 70 % improvement over ORB-SLAM3.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 10 figures, 6 tables, under revision</p></details> |

Extensive experiments validate that our proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on several public datasets, including TartanAir, EuRoC and ETH3D-SLAM.

Yet, the two problems have largely been approached independently, without much synergy. Most visual SLAM methods can only reconstruct camera trajectories and scene structures up to scale, while most HMR methods reconstruct human meshes in metric scale but fall short in reasoning with cameras and scenes. This work introduces Synergistic Camera and Human Reconstruction (SynCHMR) to marry the best of both worlds. Specifically, we design Human-aware Metric SLAM to reconstruct metric-scale camera poses and scene point clouds using camera-frame HMR as a strong prior, addressing depth, scale, and dynamic ambiguities. Conditioning on the dense scene recovered, we further learn a Scene-aware SMPL Denoiser to enhance world-frame HMR by incorporating spatio-temporal coherency and dynamic scene constraints. Together, they lead to consistent reconstructions of camera trajectories, human meshes, and dense scene point clouds in a common world frame.

However, traditional manual feature-based methods in challenging lighting environments make it difficult to ensure robustness and accuracy. Some deep learning-based methods show potential but still have significant drawbacks. To address this problem, we propose a novel hybrid system for visual SLAM based on the LightGlue deep learning network. It uses deep local feature descriptors to replace traditional hand-crafted features and a more efficient and accurate deep network to achieve fast and precise feature matching. Thus, we use the robustness of deep learning to improve the whole system. We have combined traditional geometry-based approaches to introduce a complete visual SLAM system for monocular, binocular, and RGB-D sensors. We thoroughly tested the proposed system on four public datasets: KITTI, EuRoC, TUM, and 4Season, as well as on actual campus scenes. The experimental results show that the proposed method exhibits better accuracy and robustness in adapting to low-light and strongly light-varying environments than traditional manual features and deep learning-based methods.

This paper presents a generic sparse visual SLAM framework capable of running on any number of cameras and in any arrangement. Our SLAM system uses the generalized camera model, which allows us to represent an arbitrary multi-camera system as a single imaging device. Additionally, it takes advantage of the overlapping fields of view (FoV) by extracting cross-matched features across cameras in the rig. This limits the linear rise in the number of features with the number of cameras and keeps the computational load in check while enabling an accurate representation of the scene. We evaluate our method in terms of accuracy, robustness, and run time on indoor and outdoor datasets that include challenging real-world scenarios such as narrow corridors, featureless spaces, and dynamic objects. We show that our system can adapt to different camera configurations and allows real-time execution for typical robotic applications. Finally, we benchmark the impact of the critical design parameters - the number of cameras and the overlap between their FoV that define the camera configuration for SLAM. All our software and datasets are freely available for further research.</p></details> |  |

The ones that deal with dynamic objects in the scenes usually rely on deep-learning-based methods to detect and filter these objects. However, these methods cannot deal with unknown moving objects. This work presents Panoptic-SLAM, an open-source visual SLAM system robust to dynamic environments, even in the presence of unknown objects. It uses panoptic segmentation to filter dynamic objects from the scene during the state estimation process. Panoptic-SLAM is based on ORB-SLAM3, a state-of-the-art SLAM system for static environments. The implementation was tested using real-world datasets and compared with several state-of-the-art systems from the literature, including DynaSLAM, DS-SLAM, SaD-SLAM, PVO and FusingPanoptic. For example, Panoptic-SLAM is on average four times more accurate than PVO, the most recent panoptic-based approach for visual SLAM. Also, experiments were performed using a quadruped robot with an RGB-D camera to test the applicability of our method in real-world scenarios.

| **[SLAM for Indoor Mapping of Wide Area Construction Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17215v1)** | 2024-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), i.e., the reconstruction of the environment represented by a (3D) map and the concurrent pose estimation, has made astonishing progress. Meanwhile, large scale applications aiming at the data collection in complex environments like factory halls or construction sites are becoming feasible. However, in contrast to small scale scenarios with building interiors separated to single rooms, shop floors or construction areas require measures at larger distances in potentially texture less areas under difficult illumination. Pose estimation is further aggravated since no GNSS measures are available as it is usual for such indoor applications. In our work, we realize data collection in a large factory hall by a robot system equipped with four stereo cameras as well as a 3D laser scanner. We apply our state-of-the-art LiDAR and visual SLAM approaches and discuss the respective pros and cons of the different sensor types for trajectory estimation and dense map generation in such an environment. Additionally, dense and accurate depth maps are generated by 3D Gaussian splatting, which we plan to use in the context of our project aiming on the automatic construction and site monitoring.</p></details> |  |

The main work of this project is as follows: (1) Construction of Visual SLAM system. Research has been conducted on the basic architecture of Visual SLAM. A Visual SLAM system is developed based on ORB-SLAM3 system, which can conduct dense point cloud mapping. (2) The map suitable for two-dimensional path planning is obtained through map conversion.

The map conversion converts the dense point cloud map containing a large amount of redundant map information into an extremely lightweight grid map suitable for path planning. (3) Research on path planning algorithm based on reinforcement learning. This project has conducted experimental comparisons between the Q-learning algorithm, the DQN algorithm, and the SARSA algorithm, and found that DQN is the algorithm with the fastest convergence and best performance in high-dimensional complex environments. This project has conducted experimental verification of the Visual SLAM system in a simulation environment. The experimental results obtained based on open-source dataset and self-made dataset prove the feasibility and effectiveness of the designed Visual SLAM system.

Our method, which runs live at 3fps, utilises Gaussians as the only 3D representation, unifying the required representation for accurate, efficient tracking, mapping, and high-quality rendering. Designed for challenging monocular settings, our approach is seamlessly extendable to RGB-D SLAM when an external depth sensor is available. Several innovations are required to continuously reconstruct 3D scenes with high fidelity from a live camera. First, to move beyond the original 3DGS algorithm, which requires accurate poses from an offline Structure from Motion (SfM) system, we formulate camera tracking for 3DGS using direct optimisation against the 3D Gaussians, and show that this enables fast and robust tracking with a wide basin of convergence. Second, by utilising the explicit nature of the Gaussians, we introduce geometric verification and regularisation to handle the ambiguities occurring in incremental 3D dense reconstruction. Finally, we introduce a full SLAM system which not only achieves state-of-the-art results in novel view synthesis and trajectory estimation but also reconstruction of tiny and even transparent objects.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR2...</summary><p>CVPR2024 Highlight.

When a pre-built 3D map is not available, the techniques of visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) are typically adopted. Due to error accumulation, visual SLAM (vSLAM) usually suffers from long-term drift. This paper proposes a framework to increase the localization accuracy by fusing the vSLAM with a deep-learning-based ground-to-satellite (G2S) image registration method. In this framework, a coarse (spatial correlation bound check) to fine (visual odometry consistency check) method is designed to select the valid G2S prediction. The selected prediction is then fused with the SLAM measurement by solving a scaled pose graph problem. To further increase the localization accuracy, we provide an iterative trajectory fusion pipeline. The proposed framework is evaluated on two well-known autonomous driving datasets, and the results demonstrate the accuracy and robustness in terms of vehicle localization.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 6 figures, to be published in 2024 International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)</p></details> |

It facilitates a better balance between efficiency and accuracy. Compared to recent SLAM methods employing neural implicit representations, our method utilizes a real-time differentiable splatting rendering pipeline that offers significant speedup to map optimization and RGB-D rendering. Specifically, we propose an adaptive expansion strategy that adds new or deletes noisy 3D Gaussians in order to efficiently reconstruct new observed scene geometry and improve the mapping of previously observed areas. This strategy is essential to extend 3D Gaussian representation to reconstruct the whole scene rather than synthesize a static object in existing methods. Moreover, in the pose tracking process, an effective coarse-to-fine technique is designed to select reliable 3D Gaussian representations to optimize camera pose, resulting in runtime reduction and robust estimation. Our method achieves competitive performance compared with existing state-of-the-art real-time methods on the Replica, TUM-RGBD datasets.

| **[BundledSLAM: An Accurate Visual SLAM System Using Multiple Cameras](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19886v2)** | 2024-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-camera SLAM systems offer a plethora of advantages, primarily stemming from their capacity to amalgamate information from a broader field of view, thereby resulting in heightened robustness and improved localization accuracy. In this research, we present a significant extension and refinement of the state-of-the-art stereo SLAM system, known as ORB-SLAM2, with the objective of attaining even higher precision. To accomplish this objective, we commence by mapping measurements from all cameras onto a virtual camera termed BundledFrame. This virtual camera is meticulously engineered to seamlessly adapt to multi-camera configurations, facilitating the effective fusion of data captured from multiple cameras. Additionally, we harness extrinsic parameters in the bundle adjustment (BA) process to achieve precise trajectory estimation.Furthermore, we conduct an extensive analysis of the role of bundle adjustment (BA) in the context of multi-camera scenarios, delving into its impact on tracking, local mapping, and global optimization. Our experimental evaluation entails comprehensive comparisons between ground truth data and the state-of-the-art SLAM system. To rigorously assess the system's performance, we utilize the EuRoC datasets. The consistent results of our evaluations demonstrate the superior accuracy of our system in comparison to existing approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[PLGSLAM: Progressive Neural Scene Represenation with Local to Global Bundle Adjustment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09866v2)** | 2024-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural implicit scene representations have recently shown encouraging results in dense visual SLAM. However, existing methods produce low-quality scene reconstruction and low-accuracy localization performance when scaling up to large indoor scenes and long sequences. These limitations are mainly due to their single, global radiance field with finite capacity, which does not adapt to large scenarios. Their end-to-end pose networks are also not robust enough with the growth of cumulative errors in large scenes. To this end, we introduce PLGSLAM, a neural visual SLAM system capable of high-fidelity surface reconstruction and robust camera tracking in real-time. To handle large-scale indoor scenes, PLGSLAM proposes a progressive scene representation method which dynamically allocates new local scene representation trained with frames within a local sliding window. This allows us to scale up to larger indoor scenes and improves robustness (even under pose drifts). In local scene representation, PLGSLAM utilizes tri-planes for local high-frequency features with multi-layer perceptron (MLP) networks for the low-frequency feature, achieving smoothness and scene completion in unobserved areas. Moreover, we propose local-to-global bundle adjustment method with a global keyframe database to address the increased pose drifts on long sequences. Experimental results demonstrate that PLGSLAM achieves state-of-the-art scene reconstruction results and tracking performance across various datasets and scenarios (both in small and large-scale indoor environments).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2024</p></details> |
| **[Towards Long Term SLAM on Thermal Imagery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19885v1)** | 2024-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual SLAM with thermal imagery, and other low contrast visually degraded environments such as underwater, or in areas dominated by snow and ice, remain a difficult problem for many state of the art (SOTA) algorithms. In addition to challenging front-end data association, thermal imagery presents an additional difficulty for long term relocalization and map reuse. The relative temperatures of objects in thermal imagery change dramatically from day to night. Feature descriptors typically used for relocalization in SLAM are unable to maintain consistency over these diurnal changes. We show that learned feature descriptors can be used within existing Bag of Word based localization schemes to dramatically improve place recognition across large temporal gaps in thermal imagery. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of our trained vocabulary, we have developed a baseline SLAM system, integrating learned features and matching into a classical SLAM algorithm. Our system demonstrates good local tracking on challenging thermal imagery, and relocalization that overcomes dramatic day to night thermal appearance changes.

| **[OASIS: Optimal Arrangements for Sensing in SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10698v2)** | 2024-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The number and arrangement of sensors on mobile robot dramatically influence its perception capabilities. Ensuring that sensors are mounted in a manner that enables accurate detection, localization, and mapping is essential for the success of downstream control tasks. However, when designing a new robotic platform, researchers and practitioners alike usually mimic standard configurations or maximize simple heuristics like field-of-view (FOV) coverage to decide where to place exteroceptive sensors. In this work, we conduct an information-theoretic investigation of this overlooked element of robotic perception in the context of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). We show how to formalize the sensor arrangement problem as a form of subset selection under the E-optimality performance criterion. While this formulation is NP-hard in general, we show that a combination of greedy sensor selection and fast convex relaxation-based post-hoc verification enables the efficient recovery of certifiably optimal sensor designs in practice. Results from synthetic experiments reveal that sensors placed with OASIS outperform benchmarks in terms of mean squared error of visual SLAM estimates.</p></details> |  |
| **[DVN-SLAM: Dynamic Visual Neural SLAM Based on Local-Global Encoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11776v1)** | 2024-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research on Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) based on implicit representation has shown promising results in indoor environments. However, there are still some challenges: the limited scene representation capability of implicit encodings, the uncertainty in the rendering process from implicit representations, and the disruption of consistency by dynamic objects. To address these challenges, we propose a real-time dynamic visual SLAM system based on local-global fusion neural implicit representation, named DVN-SLAM. To improve the scene representation capability, we introduce a local-global fusion neural implicit representation that enables the construction of an implicit map while considering both global structure and local details. To tackle uncertainties arising from the rendering process, we design an information concentration loss for optimization, aiming to concentrate scene information on object surfaces. The proposed DVN-SLAM achieves competitive performance in localization and mapping across multiple datasets. More importantly, DVN-SLAM demonstrates robustness in dynamic scenes, a trait that sets it apart from other NeRF-based methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stereo-NEC: Enhancing Stereo Visual-Inertial SLAM Initialization with Normal Epipolar Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07225v1)** | 2024-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an accurate and robust initialization approach for stereo visual-inertial SLAM systems. Unlike the current state-of-the-art method, which heavily relies on the accuracy of a pure visual SLAM system to estimate inertial variables without updating camera poses, potentially compromising accuracy and robustness, our approach offers a different solution. We realize the crucial impact of precise gyroscope bias estimation on rotation accuracy. This, in turn, affects trajectory accuracy due to the accumulation of translation errors. To address this, we first independently estimate the gyroscope bias and use it to formulate a maximum a posteriori problem for further refinement. After this refinement, we proceed to update the rotation estimation by performing IMU integration with gyroscope bias removed from gyroscope measurements. We then leverage robust and accurate rotation estimates to enhance translation estimation via 3-DoF bundle adjustment. Moreover, we introduce a novel approach for determining the success of the initialization by evaluating the residual of the normal epipolar constraint. Extensive evaluations on the EuRoC dataset illustrate that our method excels in accuracy and robustness. It outperforms ORB-SLAM3, the current leading stereo visual-inertial initialization method, in terms of absolute trajectory error and relative rotation error, while maintaining competitive computational speed. Notably, even with 5 keyframes for initialization, our method consistently surpasses the state-of-the-art approach using 10 keyframes in rotation accuracy.</p></details> |  |

It then grew to implement Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) on various robots and mobile platforms. As each application brings its own set of contraints on sensors, processing capabilities and locomotion, it raises the question of which SLAM approach is the most appropriate to use in terms of cost, accuracy, computation power and ease of integration. Since most of SLAM approaches are either visual or lidar-based, comparison is difficult. Therefore, we decided to extend RTAB-Map to support both visual and lidar SLAM, providing in one package a tool allowing users to implement and compare a variety of 3D and 2D solutions for a wide range of applications with different robots and sensors. This paper presents this extended version of RTAB-Map and its use in comparing, both quantitatively and qualitatively, a large selection of popular real-world datasets (e.g., KITTI, EuRoC, TUM RGB-D, MIT Stata Center on PR2 robot), outlining strengths and limitations of visual and lidar SLAM configurations from a practical perspective for autonomous navigation applications.</p></details> | 40 pages, 19 figures |

In this paper, we propose a joint multi-task network design for learning several tasks simultaneously. Our main motivation is the computational efficiency achieved by sharing the expensive initial convolutional layers between all tasks. Indeed, the main bottleneck in automated driving systems is the limited processing power available on deployment hardware. There is also some evidence for other benefits in improving accuracy for some tasks and easing development effort. It also offers scalability to add more tasks leveraging existing features and achieving better generalization. We survey various CNN based solutions for visual perception tasks in automated driving. Then we propose a unified CNN model for the important tasks and discuss several advanced optimization and architecture design techniques to improve the baseline model. The paper is partly review and partly positional with demonstration of several preliminary results promising for future research. We first demonstrate results of multi-stream learning and auxiliary learning which are important ingredients to scale to a large multi-task model.

Some researchers have attempted to enhance localization accuracy by integrating the modeled object residuals into bundle adjustment. However, few have demonstrated better results than feature-based visual SLAM systems, as the generic coarse object models, such as cuboids or ellipsoids, are less accurate than feature points. In this paper, we propose a Visual Object Odometry and Mapping framework VOOM using high-level objects and low-level points as the hierarchical landmarks in a coarse-to-fine manner instead of directly using object residuals in bundle adjustment. Firstly, we introduce an improved observation model and a novel data association method for dual quadrics, employed to represent physical objects. It facilitates the creation of a 3D map that closely reflects reality. Next, we use object information to enhance the data association of feature points and consequently update the map. In the visual object odometry backend, the updated map is employed to further optimize the camera pose and the objects. Meanwhile, local bundle adjustment is performed utilizing the objects and points-based covisibility graphs in our visual object mapping process. Experiments show that VOOM outperforms both object-oriented SLAM and feature points SLAM systems such as ORB-SLAM2 in terms of localization. The implementation of our method is available at https://github.com/yutongwangBIT/VOOM.git.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables, conference icra 2024 accepted</p></details> |
| **[An Error-Matching Exclusion Method for Accelerating Visual SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14345v2)** | 2024-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Visual SLAM, achieving accurate feature matching consumes a significant amount of time, severely impacting the real-time performance of the system. This paper proposes an accelerated method for Visual SLAM by integrating GMS (Grid-based Motion Statistics) with RANSAC (Random Sample Consensus) for the removal of mismatched features. The approach first utilizes the GMS algorithm to estimate the quantity of matched pairs within the neighborhood and ranks the matches based on their confidence. Subsequently, the Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) algorithm is employed to further eliminate mismatched features. To address the time-consuming issue of randomly selecting all matched pairs, this method transforms it into the problem of prioritizing sample selection from high-confidence matches. This enables the iterative solution of the optimal model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a comparable accuracy to the original GMS-RANSAC while reducing the average runtime by 24.13% on the KITTI, TUM desk, and TUM doll datasets.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, based on a multi-level fine matching strategy, we propose a new feature matching method called KTGP-ORB. This method utilizes the similarity of local appearance in the Hamming space generated by feature descriptors to establish initial correspondences. It combines the constraint of local image motion smoothness, uses the GMS algorithm to enhance the accuracy of initial matches, and finally employs the PROSAC algorithm to optimize matches, achieving precise matching based on global grayscale information in Euclidean space. Experimental results demonstrate that the KTGP-ORB method reduces the error by an average of 29.92% compared to the ORB algorithm in complex scenes with illumination variations and blur.</p></details> |  |

As one such use case, drones in GPS-denied environments require equipping with different sensors (e.g., vision sensors) that provide reliable sensing results while performing pose estimation and localization. In this paper, reconstructing the maps of indoor environments alongside generating 3D scene graphs for a high-level representation using a camera mounted on a drone is targeted. Accordingly, an aerial robot equipped with a companion computer and an RGB-D camera was built and employed to be appropriately integrated with a Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (VSLAM) framework proposed by the authors. To enhance the situational awareness of the robot while reconstructing maps, various structural elements, including doors and walls, were labeled with printed fiducial markers, and a dictionary of the topological relations among them was fed to the system. The VSLAM system detects markers and reconstructs the map of the indoor areas enriched with higher-level semantic entities, including corridors and rooms. Another achievement is generating multi-layered vision-based situational graphs containing enhanced hierarchical representations of the indoor environment. In this regard, integrating VSLAM into the employed drone is the primary target of this paper to provide an end-to-end robot application for GPS-denied environments. To show the practicality of the system, various real-world condition experiments have been conducted in indoor scenarios with dissimilar structural layouts. Evaluations show the proposed drone application can perform adequately w.r.t. the ground-truth data and its baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Due to the improvement of CNN-based object detection algorithm, the robustness of visual relocalization is greatly enhanced especially in viewpoints where classical methods fail. However, ellipsoids (quadrics) generated by axis-aligned object detection may limit the accuracy of the object-level representation and degenerate the performance of visual relocalization system. In this paper, we propose a novel method of automatic object-level voxel modeling for accurate ellipsoidal representations of objects. As for visual relocalization, we design a better pose optimization strategy for camera pose recovery, to fully utilize the projection characteristics of 2D fitted ellipses and the 3D accurate ellipsoids. All of these modules are entirely intergrated into visual SLAM system. Experimental results show that our semantic object-level mapping and object-based visual relocalization methods significantly enhance the performance of visual relocalization in terms of robustness to new viewpoints.</p></details> |  |

However, current research faces challenges in accurately localizing and mapping in planar ambiguous scenes, primarily due to the poor accuracy of the employed planar features and data association methods. In this paper, we propose a visual SLAM system based on planar features designed for planar ambiguous scenes, encompassing planar processing, data association, and multi-constraint factor graph optimization. We introduce a planar processing strategy that integrates semantic information with planar features, extracting the edges and vertices of planes to be utilized in tasks such as plane selection, data association, and pose optimization. Next, we present an integrated data association strategy that combines plane parameters, semantic information, projection IoU (Intersection over Union), and non-parametric tests, achieving accurate and robust plane data association in planar ambiguous scenes. Finally, we design a set of multi-constraint factor graphs for camera pose optimization. Qualitative and quantitative experiments conducted on publicly available datasets demonstrate that our proposed system competes effectively in both accuracy and robustness in terms of map construction and camera localization compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional vSLAM systems are limited by the camera's narrow field-of-view, resulting in challenges such as sparse feature distribution and lack of dense depth information. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a 360ORB-SLAM system for panoramic images that combines with a depth completion network. The system extracts feature points from the panoramic image, utilizes a panoramic triangulation module to generate sparse depth information, and employs a depth completion network to obtain a dense panoramic depth map. Experimental results on our novel panoramic dataset constructed based on Carla demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior scale accuracy compared to existing monocular SLAM methods and effectively addresses the challenges of feature association and scale ambiguity. The integration of the depth completion network enhances system stability and mitigates the impact of dynamic elements on SLAM performance.</p></details> | 6 pages, 9 figures |

This approach is devised with the dual objectives of sustaining an efficient exploration rate while optimizing SLAM accuracy. Initially, an estimation of a global traversability map is conducted, which accounts for the environmental constraints pertaining to traversability. Subsequently, we propose a goal candidate selection approach along with a path planning method towards this goal that takes into account the information provided by the landmarks used by the SLAM backend to achieve robust localization and successful path execution . The entire algorithm is tested and evaluated first in a simulated 3D world, followed by a real-world environment and is compared to pre-existing exploration methods.

To improve the computational and storage efficiency of the framework, we adopt a streamlined voxel-based 3D map representation - OctoMap to build a working system. Furthermore, the fusion algorithm is incorporated to obtain the semantic information of each frame from the front-end SLAM task, and the corresponding point. By leveraging semantic information, our framework enhances the UAV's ability to perceive and navigate through indoor spaces, addressing challenges in pose estimation accuracy and uncertainty reduction. Through Gazebo simulations, we validate the efficacy of our proposed system and successfully embed our approach into a Jetson Xavier AGX unit for real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Th...</summary><p>In The 2024 IEEE/SICE International Symposium on System Integration (SII2024), Ha Long, Vietnam</p></details> |

However, its accuracy and especially robustness still suffer from low illumination conditions, illumination changes, and aggressive motion. Event-based cameras are bio-inspired visual sensors that perform well in HDR conditions and have high temporal resolution, and thus provide an interesting alternative in such challenging scenarios. While purely event-based solutions currently do not yet produce satisfying mapping results, the present work demonstrates the feasibility of purely event-based tracking if an alternative sensor is permitted for mapping. The method relies on geometric 3D-2D registration of semi-dense maps and events, and achieves highly reliable and accurate cross-modal tracking results. Practically relevant scenarios are given by depth camera-supported tracking or map-based localization with a semi-dense map prior created by a regular image-based visual SLAM or structure-from-motion system. Conventional edge-based 3D-2D alignment is extended by a novel polarity-aware registration that makes use of signed time-surface maps (STSM) obtained from event streams. We furthermore introduce a novel culling strategy for occluded points. Both modifications increase the speed of the tracker and its robustness against occlusions or large view-point variations. The approach is validated on many real datasets covering the above-mentioned challenging conditions, and compared against similar solutions realised with regular cameras.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by IEEE Transactions on Robotics (T-RO). arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2202.02556</p></details> |

The application of these technologies has propelled society towards an era of symbiosis between humans and machines. To facilitate efficient communication between humans and intelligent robots, we propose the "Avatar" system, an immersive low-latency panoramic human-robot interaction platform.

The system enables remote control over vast physical distances, spanning campuses, provinces, countries, and even continents (New York to Shenzhen). Additionally, the system incorporates visual SLAM technology for map and trajectory recording, providing autonomous navigation capabilities. We believe that this intuitive system platform can enhance efficiency and situational experience in human-robot collaboration, and with further advancements in related technologies, it will become a versatile tool for efficient and symbiotic cooperation between AI and humans.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |

However, it is hard to develop a dedicated algorithm for mobile robots due to dynamic and challenging situations, such as poor lighting conditions and motion blur. To tackle this issue, we propose a tightly-coupled LiDAR-visual SLAM based on geometric features, which includes two sub-systems (LiDAR and monocular visual SLAM) and a fusion framework. The fusion framework associates the depth and semantics of the multi-modal geometric features to complement the visual line landmarks and to add direction optimization in Bundle Adjustment (BA). This further constrains visual odometry. On the other hand, the entire line segment detected by the visual subsystem overcomes the limitation of the LiDAR subsystem, which can only perform the local calculation for geometric features. It adjusts the direction of linear feature points and filters out outliers, leading to a higher accurate odometry system. Finally, we employ a module to detect the subsystem's operation, providing the LiDAR subsystem's output as a complementary trajectory to our system while visual subsystem tracking fails. The evaluation results on the public dataset M2DGR, gathered from ground robots across various indoor and outdoor scenarios, show that our system achieves more accurate and robust pose estimation compared to current state-of-the-art multi-modal methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ROBIO 2023</p></details> |

Addressing these challenges, this paper introduces a novel, tightly-coupled Acoustic-Visual-Inertial SLAM approach, termed AQUA-SLAM, to fuse a Doppler Velocity Log (DVL), a stereo camera, and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) within a graph optimization framework. Moreover, we propose an efficient sensor calibration technique, encompassing multi-sensor extrinsic calibration (among the DVL, camera and IMU) and DVL transducer misalignment calibration, with a fast linear approximation procedure for real-time online execution. The proposed methods are extensively evaluated in a tank environment with ground truth, and validated for offshore applications in the North Sea. The results demonstrate that our method surpasses current state-of-the-art underwater and visual-inertial SLAM systems in terms of localization accuracy and robustness. The proposed system will be made open-source for the community.</p></details> |  |

These environments pose significant challenges due to variable lighting, weather conditions, and complex terrain. Visual-Inertial SLAM has emerged as a promising solution for robust localization under such conditions. This paper benchmarks several open-source Visual-Inertial SLAM systems, including traditional methods (ORB-SLAM3, VINS-Fusion, OpenVINS, Kimera, and SVO Pro) and learning-based approaches (HFNet-SLAM, AirSLAM), to evaluate their performance in unstructured natural outdoor settings. We focus on the impact of loop closing on localization accuracy and computational demands, providing a comprehensive analysis of these systems' effectiveness in real-world environments and especially their application to embedded systems in outdoor robotics. Our contributions further include an assessment of varying frame rates on localization accuracy and computational load. The findings highlight the importance of loop closing in improving localization accuracy while managing computational resources efficiently, offering valuable insights for optimizing Visual-Inertial SLAM systems for practical outdoor applications in mobile robotics.

Hereby depth predictions from a deep neural network are fused in a fully probabilistic manner. Specifically, our method is rigorously uncertainty-aware: first, we use depth and uncertainty predictions from a deep network not only from the robot's stereo rig, but we further probabilistically fuse motion stereo that provides depth information across a range of baselines, therefore drastically increasing mapping accuracy. Next, predicted and fused depth uncertainty propagates not only into occupancy probabilities but also into alignment factors between generated dense submaps that enter the probabilistic nonlinear least squares estimator. This submap representation offers globally consistent geometry at scale. Our method is thoroughly evaluated in two benchmark datasets, resulting in localization and mapping accuracy that exceeds the state of the art, while simultaneously offering volumetric occupancy directly usable for downstream robotic planning and control in real-time.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables, accepted in ICRA 2025</p></details> |

Safe navigation is crucial for all robotics applications and requires accurate and consistent maps of the robot's surroundings. To achieve full autonomy and allow deployment in a wide variety of environments, the robot must rely on on-board state estimation which is prone to drift over time. We propose a Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV) exploration framework based on local submaps to allow retaining global consistency by applying loop-closure corrections to the relative submap poses. To enable large-scale exploration we efficiently compute global, environment-wide frontiers from the local submap frontiers and use a sampling-based next-best-view exploration planner. Our method seamlessly supports using either a LiDAR sensor or a depth camera, making it suitable for different kinds of MAV platforms. We perform comparative evaluations in simulation against a state-of-the-art submap-based exploration framework to showcase the efficiency and reconstruction quality of our approach. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of our method to real-world MAVs, one equipped with a LiDAR and the other with a depth camera.

Specifically, for line matching process, we propose a novel geometric line optical flow algorithm that efficiently tracks line features with varying lengths, whitch is do not require detections and descriptors in every frame. To address the instability of Manhattan estimation from line features, we propose a tracking-by-detection module that consistently tracks and optimizes Manhattan framse in consecutive images. By aligning the Manhattan World with the VIO world frame, the tracking could restart using the latest pose from back-end, simplifying the coordinate transformations within the system. Furthermore, we implement a mechanism to validate Manhattan frames and a novel global structural constraints back-end optimization. Extensive experiments results on vairous datasets, including benchmark and self-collected datasets, show that the proposed approach outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy and long-range robustness.

| **[RUSSO: Robust Underwater SLAM with Sonar Optimization against Visual Degradation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01434v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual degradation in underwater environments poses unique and significant challenges, which distinguishes underwater SLAM from popular vision-based SLAM on the ground. In this paper, we propose RUSSO, a robust underwater SLAM system which fuses stereo camera, inertial measurement unit (IMU), and imaging sonar to achieve robust and accurate localization in challenging underwater environments for 6 degrees of freedom (DoF) estimation. During visual degradation, the system is reduced to a sonar-inertial system estimating 3-DoF poses. The sonar pose estimation serves as a strong prior for IMU propagation, thereby enhancing the reliability of pose estimation with IMU propagation. Additionally, we propose a SLAM initialization method that leverages the imaging sonar to counteract the lack of visual features during the initialization stage of SLAM. We extensively validate RUSSO through experiments in simulator, pool, and sea scenarios. The results demonstrate that RUSSO achieves better robustness and localization accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art visual-inertial SLAM systems, especially in visually challenging scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time fusing stereo camera, IMU, and imaging sonar to realize robust underwater SLAM against visual degradation.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce LVI-GS, a tightly-coupled LiDAR-Visual-Inertial mapping framework with 3DGS, which leverages the complementary characteristics of LiDAR and image sensors to capture both geometric structures and visual details of 3D scenes. To this end, the 3D Gaussians are initialized from colourized LiDAR points and optimized using differentiable rendering. In order to achieve high-fidelity mapping, we introduce a pyramid-based training approach to effectively learn multi-level features and incorporate depth loss derived from LiDAR measurements to improve geometric feature perception. Through well-designed strategies for Gaussian-Map expansion, keyframe selection, thread management, and custom CUDA acceleration, our framework achieves real-time photo-realistic mapping. Numerical experiments are performed to evaluate the superior performance of our method compared to state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[SuperVINS: A Real-Time Visual-Inertial SLAM Framework for Challenging Imaging Conditions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21348v2)** | 2024-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The traditional visual-inertial SLAM system often struggles with stability under low-light or motion-blur conditions, leading to potential lost of trajectory tracking. High accuracy and robustness are essential for the long-term and stable localization capabilities of SLAM systems. Addressing the challenges of enhancing robustness and accuracy in visual-inertial SLAM, this paper propose SuperVINS, a real-time visual-inertial SLAM framework designed for challenging imaging conditions. In contrast to geometric modeling, deep learning features are capable of fully leveraging the implicit information present in images, which is often not captured by geometric features. Therefore, SuperVINS, developed as an enhancement of VINS-Fusion, integrates the deep learning neural network model SuperPoint for feature point extraction and loop closure detection. At the same time, a deep learning neural network LightGlue model for associating feature points is integrated in front-end feature matching. A feature matching enhancement strategy based on the RANSAC algorithm is proposed. The system is allowed to set different masks and RANSAC thresholds for various environments, thereby balancing computational cost and localization accuracy. Additionally, it allows for flexible training of specific SuperPoint bag of words tailored for loop closure detection in particular environments. The system enables real-time localization and mapping. Experimental validation on the well-known EuRoC dataset demonstrates that SuperVINS is comparable to other visual-inertial SLAM system in accuracy and robustness across the most challenging sequences. This paper analyzes the advantages of SuperVINS in terms of accuracy, real-time performance, and robustness. To facilitate knowledge exchange within the field, we have made the code for this paper publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Visual-Inertial SLAM as Simple as A, B, VINS](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05969v3)** | 2024-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present AB-VINS, a different kind of visual-inertial SLAM system. Unlike most popular VINS methods which only use hand-crafted techniques, AB-VINS makes use of three different deep neural networks. Instead of estimating sparse feature positions, AB-VINS only estimates the scale and bias parameters (a and b) of monocular depth maps, as well as other terms to correct the depth using multi-view information, which results in a compressed feature state. Despite being an optimization-based system, the front-end motion tracking thread of AB-VINS surpasses the efficiency of a state-of-the-art filtering-based method while also providing dense depth. When performing loop closures, standard keyframe-based SLAM systems need to relinearize a number of variables which is linear with respect to the number of keyframes. In contrast, the proposed AB-VINS can incorporate loop closures while only affecting a constant number of variables. This is thanks to a novel data structure called the memory tree, where keyframe poses are defined relative to each other rather than all in one global frame, allowing for all but a few states to be fixed. While AB-VINS might not be as accurate as state-of-the-art VINS algorithms, it is shown to be more robust.</p></details> | Submitted to T-RO |
| **[Enhancing Visual Inertial SLAM with Magnetic Measurements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09904v1)** | 2024-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents an extension to visual inertial odometry (VIO) by introducing tightly-coupled fusion of magnetometer measurements. A sliding window of keyframes is optimized by minimizing re-projection errors, relative inertial errors, and relative magnetometer orientation errors. The results of IMU orientation propagation are used to efficiently transform magnetometer measurements between frames producing relative orientation constraints between consecutive frames. The soft and hard iron effects are calibrated using an ellipsoid fitting algorithm. The introduction of magnetometer data results in significant reductions in the orientation error and also in recovery of the true yaw orientation with respect to the magnetic north. The proposed framework operates in all environments with slow-varying magnetic fields, mainly outdoors and underwater. We have focused our work on the underwater domain, especially in underwater caves, as the narrow passage and turbulent flow make it difficult to perform loop closures and reset the localization drift. The underwater caves present challenges to VIO due to the absence of ambient light and the confined nature of the environment, while also being a crucial source of fresh water and providing valuable historical records. Experimental results from underwater caves demonstrate the improvements in accuracy and robustness introduced by the proposed VIO extension.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advancements in Translation Accuracy for Stereo Visual-Inertial Initialization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15082v4)** | 2024-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the current initialization method in the state-of-the-art Stereo Visual-Inertial SLAM framework, ORB-SLAM3 has limitations. Its success depends on the performance of the pure stereo SLAM system and is based on the underlying assumption that pure visual SLAM can accurately estimate the camera trajectory, which is essential for inertial parameter estimation. Meanwhile, the further improved initialization method for ORB-SLAM3, known as Stereo-NEC, is time-consuming due to applying keypoint tracking to estimate gyroscope bias with normal epipolar constraints. To address the limitations of previous methods, this paper proposes a method aimed at enhancing translation accuracy during the initialization stage. The fundamental concept of our method is to improve the translation estimate with a 3 Degree-of-Freedom (DoF) Bundle Adjustment (BA), independently, while the rotation estimate is fixed, instead of using ORB-SLAM3's 6-DoF BA. Additionally, the rotation estimate will be updated by considering IMU measurements and gyroscope bias, unlike ORB-SLAM3's rotation, which is directly obtained from stereo visual odometry and may yield inferior results when operating in challenging scenarios. We also conduct extensive evaluations on the public benchmark, the EuRoC dataset, demonstrating that our method excels in accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Our framework fully exploits the benefits of wide field-of-view from multi-camera systems, and the metric scale measurements provided by an inertial measurement unit (IMU). We introduce an improved IMU pre-integration formulation based on the exponential function of an automorphism of SE_2(3), which can effectively enhance tracking performance under fast rotational motion and extended integration time. Furthermore, we extend conventional front-end tracking and back-end optimization module designed for monocular or stereo setup towards multi-camera systems, and introduce implementation details that contribute to the performance of our system in challenging scenarios. The practical validity of our approach is supported by our experiments on public datasets.

| **[IDLS: Inverse Depth Line based Visual-Inertial SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11748v2)** | 2024-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For robust visual-inertial SLAM in perceptually-challenging indoor environments,recent studies exploit line features to extract descriptive information about scene structure to deal with the degeneracy of point features. But existing point-line-based SLAM methods mainly use Pl\"ucker matrix or orthogonal representation to represent a line, which needs to calculate at least four variables to determine a line. Given the numerous line features to determine in each frame, the overly flexible line representation increases the computation burden and comprises the accuracy of the results. In this paper, we propose inverse depth representation for a line, which models each extracted line feature using only two variables, i.e., the inverse depths of the two ending points. It exploits the fact that the projected line's pixel coordinates on the image plane are rather accurate, which partially restrict the line. Using this compact line presentation, Inverse Depth Line SLAM (IDLS) is proposed to track the line features in SLAM in an accurate and efficient way. A robust line triangulation method and a novel line re-projection error model are introduced. And a two-step optimization method is proposed to firstly determine the lines and then to estimate the camera poses in each frame. IDLS is extensively evaluated in multiple perceptually-challenging datasets. The results show it is more accurate, robust, and needs lower computational overhead than the current state-of-the-art of point-line-based SLAM methods.</p></details> |  |

However, how to make full use of visual information as well as better integrate with inertial measurement unit (IMU) in visual SLAM has potential research value. This paper proposes a novel deep SLAM network with dual visual factors. The basic idea is to integrate both photometric factor and re-projection factor into the end-to-end differentiable structure through multi-factor data association module. We show that the proposed network dynamically learns and adjusts the confidence maps of both visual factors and it can be further extended to include the IMU factors as well. Extensive experiments validate that our proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on several public datasets, including TartanAir, EuRoC and ETH3D-SLAM. Specifically, when dynamically fusing the three factors together, the absolute trajectory error for both monocular and stereo configurations on EuRoC dataset has reduced by 45.3% and 36.2% respectively.</p></details> | Accepted to ICRA2024 |
| **[A Probabilistic-based Drift Correction Module for Visual Inertial SLAMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10140v1)** | 2024-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Positioning is a prominent field of study, notably focusing on Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO) and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) methods. Despite their advancements, these methods often encounter dead-reckoning errors that leads to considerable drift in estimated platform motion especially during long traverses. In such cases, the drift error is not negligible and should be rectified. Our proposed approach minimizes the drift error by correcting the estimated motion generated by any SLAM method at each epoch. Our methodology treats positioning measurements rendered by the SLAM solution as random variables formulated jointly in a multivariate distribution. In this setting, The correction of the drift becomes equivalent to finding the mode of this multivariate distribution which jointly maximizes the likelihood of a set of relevant geo-spatial priors about the platform motion and environment. Our method is integrable into any SLAM/VIO method as an correction module. Our experimental results shows the effectiveness of our approach in minimizing the drift error by 10x in long treverses.</p></details> |  |

The main limitation is the difficulty of obtaining accurate maps at high temporal and spatial resolution as a basis for informed forestry decision-making, due to the vast area forests extend over and the sheer number of trees. To address this challenge, we present an autonomous Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV) system which purely relies on cost-effective and light-weight passive visual and inertial sensors to perform under-canopy autonomous navigation. We leverage visual-inertial simultaneous localization and mapping (VI-SLAM) for accurate MAV state estimates and couple it with a volumetric occupancy submapping system to achieve a scalable mapping framework which can be directly used for path planning. As opposed to a monolithic map, submaps inherently deal with inevitable drift and corrections from VI-SLAM, since they move with pose estimates as they are updated. To ensure the safety of the MAV during navigation, we also propose a novel reference trajectory anchoring scheme that moves and deforms the reference trajectory the MAV is tracking upon state updates from the VI-SLAM system in a consistent way, even upon large changes in state estimates due to loop-closures. We thoroughly validate our system in both real and simulated forest environments with high tree densities in excess of 400 trees per hectare and at speeds up to 3 m/s - while not encountering a single collision or system failure. To the best of our knowledge this is the first system which achieves this level of performance in such unstructured environment using low-cost passive visual sensors and fully on-board computation including VI-SLAM.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |

Unlike the current state-of-the-art method, which heavily relies on the accuracy of a pure visual SLAM system to estimate inertial variables without updating camera poses, potentially compromising accuracy and robustness, our approach offers a different solution. We realize the crucial impact of precise gyroscope bias estimation on rotation accuracy. This, in turn, affects trajectory accuracy due to the accumulation of translation errors. To address this, we first independently estimate the gyroscope bias and use it to formulate a maximum a posteriori problem for further refinement. After this refinement, we proceed to update the rotation estimation by performing IMU integration with gyroscope bias removed from gyroscope measurements. We then leverage robust and accurate rotation estimates to enhance translation estimation via 3-DoF bundle adjustment. Moreover, we introduce a novel approach for determining the success of the initialization by evaluating the residual of the normal epipolar constraint. Extensive evaluations on the EuRoC dataset illustrate that our method excels in accuracy and robustness. It outperforms ORB-SLAM3, the current leading stereo visual-inertial initialization method, in terms of absolute trajectory error and relative rotation error, while maintaining competitive computational speed. Notably, even with 5 keyframes for initialization, our method consistently surpasses the state-of-the-art approach using 10 keyframes in rotation accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Our system relies solely on onboard IMU measurements, stereo infrared images, and depth images and autonomously corrects teleoperated inputs when they are deemed unsafe. We define a point in 3D space as unsafe if it satisfies either of two conditions: (i) it is occupied by an obstacle, or (ii) it remains unmapped. At each time step, an occupancy map of the environment is updated by the VI-SLAM by fusing the onboard measurements, and a CBF is constructed to parameterize the (un)safe region in the 3D space. Given the CBF and state feedback from the VI-SLAM module, a safety filter computes a certified reference that best matches the teleoperation input while satisfying the safety constraint encoded by the CBF. In contrast to existing perception-based safe control frameworks, we directly close the perception-action loop and demonstrate the full capability of safe control in combination with real-time VI-SLAM without any external infrastructure or prior knowledge of the environment. We verify the efficacy of the perceptive safety filter in real-time MAV experiments using exclusively onboard sensing and computation and show that the teleoperated MAV is able to safely navigate through unknown environments despite arbitrary inputs sent by the teleoperator.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) 2024, 7 pages, 7 figures, supplementary video is available at https://youtu.be/rCxbWY4PIfQ?si=DC-9mg7g1WooNdaV</p></details> |

Besides high-accuracy state estimation, a suitable and globally consistent representation of the 3D environment is indispensable. We present a fully tightly-coupled LiDAR-Visual-Inertial SLAM system and 3D mapping framework applying local submapping strategies to achieve scalability to large-scale environments. A novel and correspondence-free, inherently probabilistic, formulation of LiDAR residuals is introduced, expressed only in terms of the occupancy fields and its respective gradients. These residuals can be added to a factor graph optimisation problem, either as frame-to-map factors for the live estimates or as map-to-map factors aligning the submaps with respect to one another. Experimental validation demonstrates that the approach achieves state-of-the-art pose accuracy and furthermore produces globally consistent volumetric occupancy submaps which can be directly used in downstream tasks such as navigation or exploration.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) 2024</p></details> |

In this paper, we build on Kimera and extend it to use multiple cameras as well as external (eg wheel) odometry sensors, to obtain accurate and robust odometry estimates in real-world problems. Additionally, we propose an effective scheme for closing loops that circumvents the drawbacks of common alternatives based on the Perspective-n-Point method and also works with a single monocular camera. Finally, we develop a method for dense 3D mapping of the free space that combines a segmentation network for free-space detection with a homography-based dense mapping technique. We test our system on photo-realistic simulations and on several real datasets collected on a car prototype developed by the Ford Motor Company, spanning both indoor and outdoor parking scenarios. Our multi-camera system is shown to outperform state-of-the art open-source visual-inertial-SLAM pipelines (Vins-Fusion, ORB-SLAM3), and exhibits an average trajectory error under 1% of the trajectory length across more than 8km of distance traveled (combined across all datasets).

The fusion of camera and inertial measurement unit (IMU) makes up for the shortcomings of a signal sensor, which significantly improves the accuracy and robustness of localization in challenging environments. This article presents PLE-SLAM, an accurate and real-time visual-inertial SLAM algorithm based on point-line features and efficient IMU initialization. First, we use parallel computing methods to extract features and compute descriptors to ensure real-time performance. Adjacent short line segments are merged into long line segments, and isolated short line segments are directly deleted. Second, a rotation-translation-decoupled initialization method is extended to use both points and lines. Gyroscope bias is optimized by tightly coupling IMU measurements and image observations. Accelerometer bias and gravity direction are solved by an analytical method for efficiency. To improve the system's intelligence in handling complex environments, a scheme of leveraging semantic information and geometric constraints to eliminate dynamic features and A solution for loop detection and closed-loop frame pose estimation using CNN and GNN are integrated into the system. All networks are accelerated to ensure real-time performance. The experiment results on public datasets illustrate that PLE-SLAM is one of the state-of-the-art visual-inertial SLAM systems.</p></details> |  |

| **[LF-VISLAM: A SLAM Framework for Large Field-of-View Cameras with Negative Imaging Plane on Mobile Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05167v3)** | 2023-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) has become a crucial aspect in the fields of autonomous driving and robotics. One crucial component of visual SLAM is the Field-of-View (FoV) of the camera, as a larger FoV allows for a wider range of surrounding elements and features to be perceived. However, when the FoV of the camera reaches the negative half-plane, traditional methods for representing image feature points using [u,v,1]^T become ineffective. While the panoramic FoV is advantageous for loop closure, its benefits are not easily realized under large-attitude-angle differences where loop-closure frames cannot be easily matched by existing methods. As loop closure on wide-FoV panoramic data further comes with a large number of outliers, traditional outlier rejection methods are not directly applicable. To address these issues, we propose LF-VISLAM, a Visual Inertial SLAM framework for cameras with extremely Large FoV with loop closure. A three-dimensional vector with unit length is introduced to effectively represent feature points even on the negative half-plane. The attitude information of the SLAM system is leveraged to guide the feature point detection of the loop closure. Additionally, a new outlier rejection method based on the unit length representation is integrated into the loop closure module. We collect the PALVIO dataset using a Panoramic Annular Lens (PAL) system with an entire FoV of 360{\deg}x(40{\deg}~120{\deg}) and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) for Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO) to address the lack of panoramic SLAM datasets. Experiments on the established PALVIO and public datasets show that the proposed LF-VISLAM outperforms state-of-the-art SLAM methods.

| **[EDI: ESKF-based Disjoint Initialization for Visual-Inertial SLAM Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02670v1)** | 2023-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual-inertial initialization can be classified into joint and disjoint approaches. Joint approaches tackle both the visual and the inertial parameters together by aligning observations from feature-bearing points based on IMU integration then use a closed-form solution with visual and acceleration observations to find initial velocity and gravity. In contrast, disjoint approaches independently solve the Structure from Motion (SFM) problem and determine inertial parameters from up-to-scale camera poses obtained from pure monocular SLAM. However, previous disjoint methods have limitations, like assuming negligible acceleration bias impact or accurate rotation estimation by pure monocular SLAM. To address these issues, we propose EDI, a novel approach for fast, accurate, and robust visual-inertial initialization. Our method incorporates an Error-state Kalman Filter (ESKF) to estimate gyroscope bias and correct rotation estimates from monocular SLAM, overcoming dependence on pure monocular SLAM for rotation estimation. To estimate the scale factor without prior information, we offer a closed-form solution for initial velocity, scale, gravity, and acceleration bias estimation. To address gravity and acceleration bias coupling, we introduce weights in the linear least-squares equations, ensuring acceleration bias observability and handling outliers. Extensive evaluation on the EuRoC dataset shows that our method achieves an average scale error of 5.8% in less than 3 seconds, outperforming other state-of-the-art disjoint visual-inertial initialization approaches, even in challenging environments and with artificial noise corruption.</p></details> |  |
| **[PEBO-SLAM: Observer design for visual inertial SLAM with convergence guarantees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12723v1)** | 2023-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a new linear parameterization to the problem of visual inertial simultaneous localization and mapping (VI-SLAM) -- without any approximation -- for the case only using information from a single monocular camera and an inertial measurement unit. In this problem set, the system state evolves on the nonlinear manifold $SE(3)\times \mathbb{R}^{3n}$, on which we design dynamic extensions carefully to generate invariant foliations, such that the problem can be reformulated into online \emph{constant parameter} identification, then interestingly with linear regression models obtained. It demonstrates that VI-SLAM can be translated into a linear least squares problem, in the deterministic sense, \emph{globally} and \emph{exactly}. Based on this observation, we propose a novel SLAM observer, following the recently established parameter estimation-based observer (PEBO) methodology. A notable merit is that the proposed observer enjoys almost global asymptotic stability, requiring neither persistency of excitation nor uniform complete observability, which, however, are widely adopted in most existing works with provable stability but can hardly be assured in many practical scenarios.</p></details> |  |

First, our system directly operates on raw fisheye images, enabling us to fully exploit the wide Field-of-View (FoV) of fisheye cameras. Second, to overcome the low-texture challenge, we explore the tightly-coupled integration of multi-camera inputs and complementary inertial measurements via a unified factor graph and jointly optimize the poses and dense depth maps. Third, for global consistency, the wide FoV of the fisheye camera allows the system to find more potential loop closures, and powered by the broad convergence basin of RFT, our system can perform very wide baseline loop closing with little overlap. Furthermore, we introduce a semi-pose-graph BA method to avoid the expensive full global BA. By combining relative pose factors with loop closure factors, the global states can be adjusted efficiently with modest memory footprint while maintaining high accuracy. Evaluations on TUM-VI, Hilti-Oxford and Newer College datasets show the superior performance of the proposed system over prior works. In the Hilti SLAM Challenge 2022, our VIO version achieves second place. In a subsequent submission, our complete system, including the global BA backend, outperforms the winning approach.</p></details> | Accepted to ICRA2023 |

The paradigm of a centralized architecture is well established, with the robots (i.e. agents) running Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) onboard while communicating relevant data, such as e.g. Keyframes (KFs), to a central back-end (i.e. server), which then merges and optimizes the joint maps of the agents. While these frameworks have proven to be successful, their capability and performance are highly dependent on the choice of the VIO front-end, thus limiting their flexibility. In this work, we present COVINS-G, a generalized back-end building upon the COVINS framework, enabling the compatibility of the server-back-end with any arbitrary VIO front-end, including, for example, off-the-shelf cameras with odometry capabilities, such as the Realsense T265. The COVINS-G back-end deploys a multi-camera relative pose estimation algorithm for computing the loop-closure constraints allowing the system to work purely on 2D image data. In the experimental evaluation, we show on-par accuracy with state-of-the-art multi-session and collaborative SLAM systems, while demonstrating the flexibility and generality of our approach by employing different front-ends onboard collaborating agents within the same mission. The COVINS-G codebase along with a generalized front-end wrapper to allow any existing VIO front-end to be readily used in combination with the proposed collaborative back-end is open-sourced.

A core aspect of UrbanFly is its ability to robustly plan directly on the sparse point clouds generated by a Monocular Visual Inertial SLAM (VINS) backend. It achieves this by using the sparse point clouds to build an uncertainty-integrated cuboid representation of the environment through a data-driven monocular plane segmentation network. Our chosen world model provides faster distance queries than the more common voxel-grid representation, and UrbanFly leverages this capability in two different ways leading to two trajectory optimizers. The first optimizer uses a gradient-free cross-entropy method to compute trajectories that minimize collision probability and smoothness cost. Our second optimizer is a simplified version of the first and uses a sequential convex programming optimizer initialized based on probabilistic safety estimates on a set of randomly drawn trajectories. Both our trajectory optimizers are made computationally tractable and independent of the nature of underlying uncertainty by embedding the distribution of collision violations in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space. Empowered by the algorithmic innovation, UrbanFly outperforms competing baselines in metrics such as collision rate, trajectory length, etc., on a high-fidelity AirSim simulator augmented with synthetic and real-world dataset scenes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ACC 2023, Code available at https://github.com/sudarshan-s-harithas/UrbanFly</p></details> |

Most of the SLAM algorithms are based on assumption that landmarks are static. However, in the real-world, various dynamic objects exist, and they degrade the pose estimation accuracy. In addition, temporarily static objects, which are static during observation but move when they are out of sight, trigger false positive loop closings. To overcome these problems, we propose a novel visual-inertial SLAM framework, called DynaVINS, which is robust against both dynamic objects and temporarily static objects. In our framework, we first present a robust bundle adjustment that could reject the features from dynamic objects by leveraging pose priors estimated by the IMU preintegration. Then, a keyframe grouping and a multi-hypothesis-based constraints grouping methods are proposed to reduce the effect of temporarily static objects in the loop closing. Subsequently, we evaluated our method in a public dataset that contains numerous dynamic objects. Finally, the experimental results corroborate that our DynaVINS has promising performance compared with other state-of-the-art methods by successfully rejecting the effect of dynamic and temporarily static objects.

To achieve that goal, a highly robust and accurate state estimation is indispensable. Combining visual and inertial sensor modalities has proven to yield accurate and locally consistent results in short-term applications. Unfortunately, visual-inertial state estimators suffer from the accumulation of drift for long-term trajectories. To eliminate this drift, global measurements can be fused into the state estimation pipeline. The most known and widely available source of global measurements is the Global Positioning System (GPS). In this paper, we propose a novel approach that fully combines stereo Visual-Inertial Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM), including visual loop closures, with the fusion of global sensor modalities in a tightly-coupled and optimisation-based framework. Incorporating measurement uncertainties, we provide a robust criterion to solve the global reference frame initialisation problem. Furthermore, we propose a loop-closure-like optimisation scheme to compensate drift accumulated during outages in receiving GPS signals. Experimental validation on datasets and in a real-world experiment demonstrates the robustness of our approach to GPS dropouts as well as its capability to estimate highly accurate and globally consistent trajectories compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) 2022</p></details> |

Sparse visual SLAM systems have attained high levels of accuracy and robustness through the inclusion of inertial measurements in a tightly-coupled fusion. Inspired by this performance, we propose the first tightly-coupled dense RGB-D-inertial SLAM system. Our system has real-time capability while running on a GPU. It jointly optimises for the camera pose, velocity, IMU biases and gravity direction while building up a globally consistent, fully dense surfel-based 3D reconstruction of the environment. Through a series of experiments on both synthetic and real world datasets, we show that our dense visual-inertial SLAM system is more robust to fast motions and periods of low texture and low geometric variation than a related RGB-D-only SLAM system.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IROS 2017; supplementary video available at https://youtu.be/-gUdQ0cxDh0</p></details> |

State estimation techniques that rely on non-linear filtering are a strong paradigm for solving the associated information fusion task. The de facto inference method in this space is the celebrated extended Kalman filter (EKF), which relies on first-order linearizations of both the dynamical and measurement model. This paper takes a critical look at the practical implications and limitations posed by the EKF, especially under faulty visual feature associations and the presence of strong confounding noise. As an alternative, we revisit the assumed density formulation of Bayesian filtering and employ a moment matching (unscented Kalman filtering) approach to both visual-inertial odometry and visual SLAM.

Our system leverages a CNN to predict the depth map and the corresponding uncertainty map for each image. The CNN depth effectively bootstraps the back-end optimization of SLAM and meanwhile the CNN uncertainty adaptively weighs the contribution of each feature point to the back-end optimization. Given the gravity direction from the inertial sensor, we further present a fast plane detection method that detects horizontal planes via one-point RANSAC and vertical planes via two-point RANSAC. Those stably detected planes are in turn used to regularize the back-end optimization of SLAM. We evaluate our system on a public dataset, \ie, EuRoC, and demonstrate improved results over a state-of-the-art SLAM system, \ie, ORB-SLAM3.</p></details> |  |

However, real-time performance when incorporating line features in VINS has not been addressed. This paper presents PL-VINS, a real-time optimization-based monocular VINS method with point and line features, developed based on the state-of-the-art point-based VINS-Mono \cite{vins}. We observe that current works use the LSD \cite{lsd} algorithm to extract line features; however, LSD is designed for scene shape representation instead of the pose estimation problem, which becomes the bottleneck for the real-time performance due to its high computational cost. In this paper, a modified LSD algorithm is presented by studying a hidden parameter tuning and length rejection strategy. The modified LSD can run at least three times as fast as LSD. Further, by representing space lines with the Pl\"{u}cker coordinates, the residual error in line estimation is modeled in terms of the point-to-line distance, which is then minimized by iteratively updating the minimum four-parameter orthonormal representation of the Pl\"{u}cker coordinates. Experiments in a public benchmark dataset show that the localization error of our method is 12-16\% less than that of VINS-Mono at the same pose update frequency. %For the benefit of the community, The source code of our method is available at: https://github.com/cnqiangfu/PL-VINS.</p></details> | <details><summary>Visua...</summary><p>Visual-Inertial SLAM, LSD, Lines, SLAM, VINS-Mono</p></details> |

These depth sensors, however, suffer from stereo artefacts and do not provide dense depth estimates.In this work, we present the first self-supervised depth completion method for active stereo systems that predicts accurate dense depth maps. Our system leverages a feature-based visual inertial SLAM system to produce motion estimates and accurate (but sparse) 3D landmarks. The 3D landmarks are used both as model input and as supervision during training. The motion estimates are used in our novel reconstruction loss that relies on a combination of passive and active stereo frames, resulting in significant improvements in textureless areas that are common in indoor environments. Due to the nonexistence of publicly available active stereo datasets, we release a real dataset together with additional information for a publicly available synthetic dataset (TartanAir [42]) needed for active depth completion and prediction. Through rigorous evaluations we show that our method outperforms state of the art on both datasets. Additionally we show how our method obtains more complete, and therefore safer, 3D maps when used in a robotic platform.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to RAL-ICRA 21</p></details> |

This mental model captures geometric and semantic aspects of the scene, describes the environment at multiple levels of abstractions (e.g., objects, rooms, buildings), includes static and dynamic entities and their relations (e.g., a person is in a room at a given time). In contrast, current robots' internal representations still provide a partial and fragmented understanding of the environment, either in the form of a sparse or dense set of geometric primitives (e.g., points, lines, planes, voxels) or as a collection of objects. This paper attempts to reduce the gap between robot and human perception by introducing a novel representation, a 3D Dynamic Scene Graph(DSG), that seamlessly captures metric and semantic aspects of a dynamic environment. A DSG is a layered graph where nodes represent spatial concepts at different levels of abstraction, and edges represent spatio-temporal relations among nodes. Our second contribution is Kimera, the first fully automatic method to build a DSG from visual-inertial data. Kimera includes state-of-the-art techniques for visual-inertial SLAM, metric-semantic 3D reconstruction, object localization, human pose and shape estimation, and scene parsing. Our third contribution is a comprehensive evaluation of Kimera in real-life datasets and photo-realistic simulations, including a newly released dataset, uHumans2, which simulates a collection of crowded indoor and outdoor scenes. Our evaluation shows that Kimera achieves state-of-the-art performance in visual-inertial SLAM, estimates an accurate 3D metric-semantic mesh model in real-time, and builds a DSG of a complex indoor environment with tens of objects and humans in minutes.

A multi-state constrained filter (MSCKF) and its Schmidt version have been developed to address the computational cost, which treats keyframes as static nuisance parameters, leading to sub-optimal performance. We propose a new Compressed-MSCKF which can achieve improved accuracy with moderate computational costs. By keeping the information gain with compressed form, it can limit to $\mathcal{O}(L)$ with $L$ being the number of local keyframes. The performance of the proposed system has been evaluated using a MATLAB simulator.</p></details> |  |

This article presents COVINS, a novel collaborative SLAM system, that enables multi-agent, scalable SLAM in large environments and for large teams of more than 10 agents. The paradigm here is that each agent runs visual-inertial odomety independently onboard in order to ensure its autonomy, while sharing map information with the COVINS server back-end running on a powerful local PC or a remote cloud server. The server back-end establishes an accurate collaborative global estimate from the contributed data, refining the joint estimate by means of place recognition, global optimization and removal of redundant data, in order to ensure an accurate, but also efficient SLAM process. A thorough evaluation of COVINS reveals increased accuracy of the collaborative SLAM estimates, as well as efficiency in both removing redundant information and reducing the coordination overhead, and demonstrates successful operation in a large-scale mission with 12 agents jointly performing SLAM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Collaborative Visual Inertial SLAM for Multiple Smart Phones](http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.12186v1)** | 2021-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The efficiency and accuracy of mapping are crucial in a large scene and long-term AR applications. Multi-agent cooperative SLAM is the precondition of multi-user AR interaction. The cooperation of multiple smart phones has the potential to improve efficiency and robustness of task completion and can complete tasks that a single agent cannot do. However, it depends on robust communication, efficient location detection, robust mapping, and efficient information sharing among agents. We propose a multi-intelligence collaborative monocular visual-inertial SLAM deployed on multiple ios mobile devices with a centralized architecture. Each agent can independently explore the environment, run a visual-inertial odometry module online, and then send all the measurement information to a central server with higher computing resources. The server manages all the information received, detects overlapping areas, merges and optimizes the map, and shares information with the agents when needed. We have verified the performance of the system in public datasets and real environments. The accuracy of mapping and fusion of the proposed system is comparable to VINS-Mono which requires higher computing resources.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages,4 figures,ICRA2021</p></details> |

The first main novelty is a feature-based tightly-integrated visual-inertial SLAM system that fully relies on Maximum-a-Posteriori (MAP) estimation, even during the IMU initialization phase. The result is a system that operates robustly in real-time, in small and large, indoor and outdoor environments, and is 2 to 5 times more accurate than previous approaches. The second main novelty is a multiple map system that relies on a new place recognition method with improved recall. Thanks to it, ORB-SLAM3 is able to survive to long periods of poor visual information: when it gets lost, it starts a new map that will be seamlessly merged with previous maps when revisiting mapped areas. Compared with visual odometry systems that only use information from the last few seconds, ORB-SLAM3 is the first system able to reuse in all the algorithm stages all previous information. This allows to include in bundle adjustment co-visible keyframes, that provide high parallax observations boosting accuracy, even if they are widely separated in time or if they come from a previous mapping session. Our experiments show that, in all sensor configurations, ORB-SLAM3 is as robust as the best systems available in the literature, and significantly more accurate. Notably, our stereo-inertial SLAM achieves an average accuracy of 3.6 cm on the EuRoC drone and 9 mm under quick hand-held motions in the room of TUM-VI dataset, a setting representative of AR/VR scenarios. For the benefit of the community we make public the source code.</p></details> |  |
| **[Consistent Right-Invariant Fixed-Lag Smoother with Application to Visual Inertial SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.08596v2)** | 2021-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State estimation problems without absolute position measurements routinely arise in navigation of unmanned aerial vehicles, autonomous ground vehicles, etc., whose proper operation relies on accurate state estimates and reliable covariances. Unaware of absolute positions, these problems have immanent unobservable directions. Traditional causal estimators, however, usually gain spurious information on the unobservable directions, leading to over-confident covariance inconsistent with actual estimator errors. The consistency problem of fixed-lag smoothers (FLSs) has only been attacked by the first estimate Jacobian (FEJ) technique because of the complexity to analyze their observability property. But the FEJ has several drawbacks hampering its wide adoption. To ensure the consistency of a FLS, this paper introduces the right invariant error formulation into the FLS framework. To our knowledge, we are the first to analyze the observability of a FLS with the right invariant error. Our main contributions are twofold. As the first novelty, to bypass the complexity of analysis with the classic observability matrix, we show that observability analysis of FLSs can be done equivalently on the linearized system. Second, we prove that the inconsistency issue in the traditional FLS can be elegantly solved by the right invariant error formulation without artificially correcting Jacobians. By applying the proposed FLS to the monocular visual inertial simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem, we confirm that the method consistently estimates covariance similarly to a batch smoother in simulation and that our method achieved comparable accuracy as traditional FLSs on real data.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 4 figures, AAAI 2021 Conference</p></details> |

The front-end module of the state-of-the-art visual-inertial SLAM methods (e.g. visual feature extraction and matching schemes) relies on feature tracks across image frames, which are easily broken in challenging scenarios, resulting in insufficient visual measurement and accumulated error in pose estimation. In this paper, we propose an efficient drift-less SLAM method by re-identifying existing features from a spatial-temporal sensitive sub-global map. The re-identified features over a long time span serve as augmented visual measurements and are incorporated into the optimization module which can gradually decrease the accumulative error in the long run, and further build a drift-less global map in the system. Extensive experiments show that our feature re-identification method is both effective and efficient. Specifically, when combining the feature re-identification with the state-of-the-art SLAM method [11], our method achieves 67.3% and 87.5% absolute translation error reduction with only a small additional computational cost on two public SLAM benchmark DBs: EuRoC and TUM-VI respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, Submitted to ICRA2021</p></details> |

In this paper, firstly we perform an observability analysis w.r.t. the extrinsic parameters before the first turning, which is a complement of the existing results of observability analyses. Secondly, inspired by the above observability analyses, we propose a bidirectional trajectory computation method, by which the poses before the first turning are refined in the backward computation thread, and the real-time trajectory is adjusted accordingly. Experimental results prove that our proposed method not only solves the problem of the unobservability of accelerometer bias and extrinsic parameters before the first turning, but also results in more accurate trajectories in comparison with the state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters</p></details> |

Specifically, in order to achieve real-time operation, existing approaches often assume previously-estimated states to be perfectly known, which leads to inconsistent estimates. Instead, based on the idea of the Schmidt-Kalman filter, which has processing cost linear in the size of the state vector but quadratic memory requirements, we derive a new consistent approximate method in the information domain, which has linear memory requirements and adjustable (constant to linear) processing cost. In particular, this method, the resource-aware inverse Schmidt estimator (RISE), allows trading estimation accuracy for computational efficiency. Furthermore, and in order to better address the requirements of a SLAM system during an exploration vs. a relocalization phase, we employ different configurations of RISE (in terms of the number and order of states updated) to maximize accuracy while preserving efficiency. Lastly, we evaluate the proposed RISE-SLAM algorithm on publicly-available datasets and demonstrate its superiority, both in terms of accuracy and efficiency, as compared to alternative visual-inertial SLAM systems.</p></details> | IROS 2019 |
| **[Deep Depth Estimation from Visual-Inertial SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.00092v2)** | 2020-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the problem of learning to complete a scene's depth from sparse depth points and images of indoor scenes. Specifically, we study the case in which the sparse depth is computed from a visual-inertial simultaneous localization and mapping (VI-SLAM) system. The resulting point cloud has low density, it is noisy, and has non-uniform spatial distribution, as compared to the input from active depth sensors, e.g., LiDAR or Kinect. Since the VI-SLAM produces point clouds only over textured areas, we compensate for the missing depth of the low-texture surfaces by leveraging their planar structures and their surface normals which is an important intermediate representation. The pre-trained surface normal network, however, suffers from large performance degradation when there is a significant difference in the viewing direction (especially the roll angle) of the test image as compared to the trained ones. To address this limitation, we use the available gravity estimate from the VI-SLAM to warp the input image to the orientation prevailing in the training dataset. This results in a significant performance gain for the surface normal estimate, and thus the dense depth estimates. Finally, we show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches both on training (ScanNet and NYUv2) and testing (collected with Azure Kinect) datasets.</p></details> | 9 pages |

Scene graphs are directed graphs where nodes represent entities in the scene (e.g. objects, walls, rooms), and edges represent relations (e.g. inclusion, adjacency) among nodes. Dynamic scene graphs (DSGs) extend this notion to represent dynamic scenes with moving agents (e.g. humans, robots), and to include actionable information that supports planning and decision-making (e.g. spatio-temporal relations, topology at different levels of abstraction). Our second contribution is to provide the first fully automatic Spatial PerceptIon eNgine(SPIN) to build a DSG from visual-inertial data. We integrate state-of-the-art techniques for object and human detection and pose estimation, and we describe how to robustly infer object, robot, and human nodes in crowded scenes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that reconciles visual-inertial SLAM and dense human mesh tracking. Moreover, we provide algorithms to obtain hierarchical representations of indoor environments (e.g. places, structures, rooms) and their relations. Our third contribution is to demonstrate the proposed spatial perception engine in a photo-realistic Unity-based simulator, where we assess its robustness and expressiveness. Finally, we discuss the implications of our proposal on modern robotics applications. 3D Dynamic Scene Graphs can have a profound impact on planning and decision-making, human-robot interaction, long-term autonomy, and scene prediction.

| **[Monocular visual-inertial SLAM algorithm combined with wheel speed anomaly detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.09901v1)** | 2020-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To address the weak observability of monocular visual-inertial odometers on ground-based mobile robots, this paper proposes a monocular inertial SLAM algorithm combined with wheel speed anomaly detection. The algorithm uses a wheel speed odometer pre-integration method to add the wheel speed measurement to the least-squares problem in a tightly coupled manner. For abnormal motion situations, such as skidding and abduction, this paper adopts the Mecanum mobile chassis control method, based on torque control. This method uses the motion constraint error to estimate the reliability of the wheel speed measurement. At the same time, in order to prevent incorrect chassis speed measurements from negatively influencing robot pose estimation, this paper uses three methods to detect abnormal chassis movement and analyze chassis movement status in real time. When the chassis movement is determined to be abnormal, the wheel odometer pre-integration measurement of the current frame is removed from the state estimation equation, thereby ensuring the accuracy and robustness of the state estimation. Experimental results show that the accuracy and robustness of the method in this paper are better than those of a monocular visual-inertial odometer.</p></details> |  |

Conventionally, the performance of visual-inertial SLAM is evaluated with open-loop analysis, with a focus on the drift level of SLAM systems. In this paper, we raise the question on the importance of visual estimation latency in closed-loop navigation tasks, such as accurate trajectory tracking. To understand the impact of both drift and latency on visual-inertial SLAM systems, a closed-loop benchmarking simulation is conducted, where a robot is commanded to follow a desired trajectory using the feedback from visual-inertial estimation. By extensively evaluating the trajectory tracking performance of representative state-of-the-art visual-inertial SLAM systems, we reveal the importance of latency reduction in visual estimation module of these systems. The findings suggest directions of future improvements for visual-inertial SLAM.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures.

The library goes beyond existing visual and visual-inertial SLAM libraries (e.g., ORB-SLAM, VINS- Mono, OKVIS, ROVIO) by enabling mesh reconstruction and semantic labeling in 3D. Kimera is designed with modularity in mind and has four key components: a visual-inertial odometry (VIO) module for fast and accurate state estimation, a robust pose graph optimizer for global trajectory estimation, a lightweight 3D mesher module for fast mesh reconstruction, and a dense 3D metric-semantic reconstruction module. The modules can be run in isolation or in combination, hence Kimera can easily fall back to a state-of-the-art VIO or a full SLAM system. Kimera runs in real-time on a CPU and produces a 3D metric-semantic mesh from semantically labeled images, which can be obtained by modern deep learning methods. We hope that the flexibility, computational efficiency, robustness, and accuracy afforded by Kimera will build a solid basis for future metric-semantic SLAM and perception research, and will allow researchers across multiple areas (e.g., VIO, SLAM, 3D reconstruction, segmentation) to benchmark and prototype their own efforts without having to start from scratch.</p></details> | 8 pages |

Extending visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) with other modalities such as an inertial measurement unit (IMU) can boost robustness and accuracy. However, for a tight sensor fusion, accurate time synchronization of the sensors is often crucial. Changing exposure times, internal sensor filtering, multiple clock sources and unpredictable delays from operation system scheduling and data transfer can make sensor synchronization challenging. In this paper, we present VersaVIS, an Open Versatile Multi-Camera Visual-Inertial Sensor Suite aimed to be an efficient research platform for easy deployment, integration and extension for many mobile robotic applications. VersaVIS provides a complete, open-source hardware, firmware and software bundle to perform time synchronization of multiple cameras with an IMU featuring exposure compensation, host clock translation and independent and stereo camera triggering. The sensor suite supports a wide range of cameras and IMUs to match the requirements of the application. The synchronization accuracy of the framework is evaluated on multiple experiments achieving timing accuracy of less than 1 ms. Furthermore, the applicability and versatility of the sensor suite is demonstrated in multiple applications including visual-inertial SLAM, multi-camera applications, multimodal mapping, reconstruction and object based mapping.</p></details> |  |

We improve accuracy with several rounds of visual-inertial bundle adjustment, and robustify the method with novel observability and consensus tests, that discard erroneous solutions. Our results on the EuRoC dataset show that, while the original method produces scale errors up to 156%, our method is able to consistently initialize in less than two seconds with scale errors around 5%, which can be further reduced to less than 1% performing visual-inertial bundle adjustment after ten seconds.</p></details> | <details><summary>2019 ...</summary><p>2019 International Conference on Robotics and Automation</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose a novel, high-precision, efficient visual-inertial (VI)-SLAM algorithm, termed Schmidt-EKF VI-SLAM (SEVIS), which optimally fuses IMU measurements and monocular images in a tightly-coupled manner to provide 3D motion tracking with bounded error. In particular, we adapt the Schmidt Kalman filter formulation to selectively include informative features in the state vector while treating them as nuisance parameters (or Schmidt states) once they become matured. This change in modeling allows for significant computational savings by no longer needing to constantly update the Schmidt states (or their covariance), while still allowing the EKF to correctly account for their cross-correlations with the active states. As a result, we achieve linear computational complexity in terms of map size, instead of quadratic as in the standard SLAM systems. In order to fully exploit the map information to bound navigation drifts, we advocate efficient keyframe-aided 2D-to-2D feature matching to find reliable correspondences between current 2D visual measurements and 3D map features. The proposed SEVIS is extensively validated in both simulations and experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 2019 Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)</p></details> |
| **[Observability Analysis of Aided INS with Heterogeneous Features of Points, Lines and Planes](http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.05876v1)** | 2018-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we perform a thorough observability analysis for linearized inertial navigation systems (INS) aided by exteroceptive range and/or bearing sensors (such as cameras, LiDAR and sonars) with different geometric features (points, lines and planes). While the observability of vision-aided INS (VINS) with point features has been extensively studied in the literature, we analytically show that the general aided INS with point features preserves the same observability property: that is, 4 unobservable directions, corresponding to the global yaw and the global position of the sensor platform. We further prove that there are at least 5 (and 7) unobservable directions for the linearized aided INS with a single line (and plane) feature; and, for the first time, analytically derive the unobservable subspace for the case of multiple lines/planes. Building upon this, we examine the system observability of the linearized aided INS with different combinations of points, lines and planes, and show that, in general, the system preserves at least 4 unobservable directions, while if global measurements are available, as expected, some unobservable directions diminish. In particular, when using plane features, we propose to use a minimal, closest point (CP) representation; and we also study in-depth the effects of 5 degenerate motions identified on observability. To numerically validate our analysis, we develop and evaluate both EKF-based visual-inertial SLAM and visual-inertial odometry (VIO) using heterogeneous geometric features in Monte Carlo simulations.</p></details> |  |

This is achieved by firstly performing the visual-inertial extended kalman filter(EKF) to provide motion estimate at a high rate. However the filter becomes inconsistent due to the well known linearization issues. So we perform a keyframe-based visual-inertial bundle adjustment to improve the consistency and accuracy of the system. In addition, a loop closure detection and correction module is also added to eliminate the accumulated drift when revisiting an area. Finally, the optimized motion estimates and map are fed back to the EKF-based visual-inertial odometry module, thus the inconsistency and estimation error of the EKF estimator are reduced. In this way, the system can continuously provide reliable motion estimates for the long-term operation. The performance of the algorithm is validated on public datasets and real-world experiments, which proves the superiority of the proposed algorithm.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures |

However, such locally accurate visual-inertial odometry is prone to drift and cannot provide absolute pose estimation. Leveraging history information to relocalize and correct drift has become a hot topic. In this paper, we propose a monocular visual-inertial SLAM system, which can relocalize camera and get the absolute pose in a previous-built map. Then 4-DOF pose graph optimization is performed to correct drifts and achieve global consistent. The 4-DOF contains x, y, z, and yaw angle, which is the actual drifted direction in the visual-inertial system. Furthermore, the proposed system can reuse a map by saving and loading it in an efficient way. Current map and previous map can be merged together by the global pose graph optimization. We validate the accuracy of our system on public datasets and compare against other state-of-the-art algorithms. We also evaluate the map merging ability of our system in the large-scale outdoor environment. The source code of map reuse is integrated into our public code, VINS-Mono.</p></details> | 8 pages |

Current methods improve VIO by incorporating a model of the translational vehicle dynamics, yet their performance degrades when faced with low-accuracy vehicle models or continuous external disturbances, like wind. Additionally, incorporating rotational dynamics in these models is computationally intractable when they are deployed in online applications, e.g., in a closed-loop control system. We present HDVIO2.0, which models full 6-DoF, translational and rotational, vehicle dynamics and tightly incorporates them into a VIO with minimal impact on the runtime. HDVIO2.0 builds upon the previous work, HDVIO, and addresses these challenges through a hybrid dynamics model combining a point-mass vehicle model with a learning-based component, with access to control commands and IMU history, to capture complex aerodynamic effects. The key idea behind modeling the rotational dynamics is to represent them with continuous-time functions. HDVIO2.0 leverages the divergence between the actual motion and the predicted motion from the hybrid dynamics model to estimate external forces as well as the robot state. Our system surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art methods in experiments using public and new drone dynamics datasets, as well as real-world flights in winds up to 25 km/h. Unlike existing approaches, we also show that accurate vehicle dynamics predictions are achievable without precise knowledge of the full vehicle state.</p></details> |  |
| **[Flying through Moving Gates without Full State Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15799v3)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous drone racing requires powerful perception, planning, and control and has become a benchmark and test field for autonomous, agile flight. Existing work usually assumes static race tracks with known maps, which enables offline planning of time-optimal trajectories, performing localization to the gates to reduce the drift in visual-inertial odometry (VIO) for state estimation or training learning-based methods for the particular race track and operating environment. In contrast, many real-world tasks like disaster response or delivery need to be performed in unknown and dynamic environments. To make drone racing more robust against unseen environments and moving gates, we propose a control algorithm that operates without a race track map or VIO, relying solely on monocular measurements of the line of sight to the gates. For this purpose, we adopt the law of proportional navigation (PN) to accurately fly through the gates despite gate motions or wind. We formulate the PN-informed vision-based control problem for drone racing as a constrained optimization problem and derive a closed-form optimal solution.

In particular, when visual tracking encounters errors, the optimized bias results may deviate significantly from the true values, adversely impacting the system's stability and localization precision. In this paper, we propose a novel plug-and-play framework featuring the Inertial Prior Network (IPNet), which is designed to accurately estimate IMU bias. Recognizing the substantial impact of initial bias errors in low-cost inertial devices on system performance, our network directly leverages raw IMU data to estimate the mean bias, eliminating the dependency on historical estimates in traditional recursive predictions and effectively preventing error propagation. Furthermore, we introduce an iterative approach to calculate the mean value of the bias for network training, addressing the lack of bias labels in many visual-inertial datasets. The framework is evaluated on two public datasets and one self-collected dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly enhances both localization precision and robustness, with the ATE-RMSE metric improving on average by 46\%.

Providing valuable contextual information about the environment, the prior map is a vital tool for mitigating drift. In this paper, we propose a map-based visual-inertial localization algorithm (NeRF-VIO) with initialization using neural radiance fields (NeRF). Our algorithm utilizes a multilayer perceptron model and redefines the loss function as the geodesic distance on \(SE(3)\), ensuring the invariance of the initialization model under a frame change within \(\mathfrak{se}(3)\). The evaluation demonstrates that our model outperforms existing NeRF-based initialization solution in both accuracy and efficiency. By integrating a two-stage update mechanism within a multi-state constraint Kalman filter (MSCKF) framework, the state of NeRF-VIO is constrained by both captured images from an onboard camera and rendered images from a pre-trained NeRF model. The proposed algorithm is validated using a real-world AR dataset, the results indicate that our two-stage update pipeline outperforms MSCKF across all data sequences.</p></details> |  |

However, the filter-based method has the problem of insufficient accuracy. To this end, we propose the State transformation and Pose-only VIO (SP-VIO) by rebuilding the state and measurement models, and considering further visual deprived conditions. In detail, we first proposed the double state transformation extended Kalman filter (DST-EKF) to replace the standard extended Kalman filter (Std-EKF) for improving the system's consistency, and then adopt pose-only (PO) visual description to avoid the linearization error caused by 3D feature estimation. The comprehensive observability analysis shows that SP-VIO has a more stable unobservable subspace, which can better avoid the inconsistency problem caused by spurious information. Moreover, we propose an enhanced double state transformation Rauch-Tung-Striebel (DST-RTS) backtracking method to optimize motion trajectories during visual interruption. Monte-Carlo simulations and real-world experiments show that SP-VIO has better accuracy and efficiency than state-of-the-art (SOTA) VIO algorithms, and has better robustness under visual deprived conditions.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, for line matching process, we propose a novel geometric line optical flow algorithm that efficiently tracks line features with varying lengths, whitch is do not require detections and descriptors in every frame. To address the instability of Manhattan estimation from line features, we propose a tracking-by-detection module that consistently tracks and optimizes Manhattan framse in consecutive images. By aligning the Manhattan World with the VIO world frame, the tracking could restart using the latest pose from back-end, simplifying the coordinate transformations within the system. Furthermore, we implement a mechanism to validate Manhattan frames and a novel global structural constraints back-end optimization. Extensive experiments results on vairous datasets, including benchmark and self-collected datasets, show that the proposed approach outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy and long-range robustness.

However, real-world scenes often feature dynamic objects, compromising the accuracy of VIO. The diversity and partial occlusion of these objects present a tough challenge for existing dynamic VIO methods. To tackle this challenge, we introduce ADUGS-VINS, which integrates an enhanced SORT algorithm along with a promptable foundation model into VIO, thereby improving pose estimation accuracy in environments with diverse dynamic objects and frequent occlusions. We evaluated our proposed method using multiple public datasets representing various scenes, as well as in a real-world scenario involving diverse dynamic objects. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method performs impressively in multiple scenarios, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods. This highlights its remarkable generalization and adaptability in diverse dynamic environments, showcasing its potential to handle various dynamic objects in practical applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[ESVO2: Direct Visual-Inertial Odometry with Stereo Event Cameras](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09374v3)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event-based visual odometry is a specific branch of visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) techniques, which aims at solving tracking and mapping subproblems (typically in parallel), by exploiting the special working principles of neuromorphic (i.e., event-based) cameras. Due to the motion-dependent nature of event data, explicit data association (i.e., feature matching) under large-baseline view-point changes is difficult to establish, making direct methods a more rational choice. However, state-of-the-art direct methods are limited by the high computational complexity of the mapping sub-problem and the degeneracy of camera pose tracking in certain degrees of freedom (DoF) in rotation. In this paper, we tackle these issues by building an event-based stereo visual-inertial odometry system on top of a direct pipeline. Specifically, to speed up the mapping operation, we propose an efficient strategy for sampling contour points according to the local dynamics of events. The mapping performance is also improved in terms of structure completeness and local smoothness by merging the temporal stereo and static stereo results. To circumvent the degeneracy of camera pose tracking in recovering the pitch and yaw components of general 6-DoF motion, we introduce IMU measurements as motion priors via pre-integration. To this end, a compact back-end is proposed for continuously updating the IMU bias and predicting the linear velocity, enabling an accurate motion prediction for camera pose tracking. The resulting system scales well with modern high-resolution event cameras and leads to better global positioning accuracy in large-scale outdoor environments. Extensive evaluations on five publicly available datasets featuring different resolutions and scenarios justify the superior performance of the proposed system against five state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

By taking sequences of images and 6-DoF inertial measurements as inputs, XIRVIO's generator predicts pose trajectories through an iterative refinement process which are then evaluated by the critic to select the iteration with the optimised prediction. Additionally, the self-emergent adaptive sensor weighting reveals how XIRVIO attends to each sensory input based on contextual cues in the data, making it a promising approach for achieving explainability in safety-critical VIO applications. Evaluations on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that XIRVIO matches well-known state-of-the-art learning-based methods in terms of both translation and rotation errors.</p></details> | 7 pages, 6 figures |

To successfully bootstrap VIO algorithms, the initialization module is extremely important. Most initialization methods rely on the reconstruction of 3D visual point clouds. These methods suffer from high computational cost as state vector contains both motion states and 3D feature points. To address this issue, some researchers recently proposed a structureless initialization method, which can solve the initial state without recovering 3D structure. However, this method potentially compromises performance due to the decoupled estimation of rotation and translation, as well as linear constraints. To improve its accuracy, we propose novel structureless visual-inertial bundle adjustment to further refine previous structureless solution. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show our method significantly improves the VIO initialization accuracy, while maintaining real-time performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICRA 2025</p></details> |

During initialization, it is crucial to estimate parameters such as accelerometer bias, gyroscope bias, initial velocity, gravity, etc. Most existing VIO initialization methods adopt Structure from Motion (SfM) to solve for gyroscope bias. However, SfM is not stable and efficient enough in fast-motion or degenerate scenes. To overcome these limitations, we extended the rotation-translation-decoupled framework by adding new uncertainty parameters and optimization modules. First, we adopt a gyroscope bias estimator that incorporates probabilistic normal epipolar constraints. Second, we fuse IMU and visual measurements to solve for velocity, gravity, and scale efficiently. Finally, we design an additional refinement module that effectively reduces gravity and scale errors. Extensive EuRoC dataset tests show that our method reduces gyroscope bias and rotation errors by 16\% and 4\% on average, and gravity error by 29\% on average. On the TUM dataset, our method reduces the gravity error and scale error by 14.2\% and 5.7\% on average respectively.

These systems, including LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO) and Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO), often face challenges in localization due to adverse environmental conditions such as dust, smoke, and limited visual features. To address these limitations, we propose a novel head-mounted Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) dataset with ground truth, aimed at advancing data-driven IMU pose estimation. Our dataset captures human head motion patterns using a helmet-mounted system, with data from ten participants performing various activities. We explore the application of neural networks, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Transformer networks, to correct IMU biases and improve localization accuracy. Additionally, we evaluate the performance of these methods across different IMU data window dimensions, motion patterns, and sensor types. We release a publicly available dataset, demonstrate the feasibility of advanced neural network approaches for helmet-based localization, and provide evaluation metrics to establish a baseline for future studies in this field.

The method exploits a recurrent neural network using as inputs inertial cues, motor commands, and battery voltage readings alongside the hidden state of the previous time-step to output robust velocity estimates and their associated uncertainty. An ensemble of networks is utilized to enhance the velocity and uncertainty predictions. Fusing the network's outputs into an Extended Kalman Filter, alongside inertial predictions and barometer updates, the method enables long-term underwater odometry without further exteroception. Furthermore, when integrated into visual-inertial odometry, the method assists in enhanced estimation resilience when dealing with an order of magnitude fewer total features tracked (as few as 1) as compared to conventional visual-inertial systems. Tested onboard an underwater robot deployed both in a laboratory pool and the Trondheim Fjord, the method takes less than 5ms for inference either on the CPU or the GPU of an NVIDIA Orin AGX and demonstrates less than 4% relative position error in novel trajectories during complete visual blackout, and approximately 2% relative error when a maximum of 2 visual features from a monocular camera are available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at the 2025 IEEE International Conference on Robotics & Automation (ICRA 2025), Atlanta, USA</p></details> |
| **[A Transformation-based Consistent Estimation Framework: Analysis, Design and Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05008v1)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we investigate the inconsistency problem arising from observability mismatch that frequently occurs in nonlinear systems such as multi-robot cooperative localization and simultaneous localization and mapping. For a general nonlinear system, we discover and theoretically prove that the unobservable subspace of the EKF estimator system is independent of the state and belongs to the unobservable subspace of the original system. On this basis, we establish the necessary and sufficient conditions for achieving observability matching. These theoretical findings motivate us to introduce a linear time-varying transformation to achieve a transformed system possessing a state-independent unobservable subspace. We prove the existence of such transformations and propose two design methodologies for constructing them. Moreover, we propose two equivalent consistent transformation-based EKF estimators, referred to as T-EKF 1 and T-EKF 2, respectively. T-EKF 1 employs the transformed system for consistent estimation, whereas T-EKF 2 leverages the original system but ensures consistency through state and covariance corrections from transformations. To validate our proposed methods, we conduct experiments on several representative examples, including multi-robot cooperative localization, multi-source target tracking, and 3D visual-inertial odometry, demonstrating that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy, consistency, computational efficiency, and practical realizations.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods for initialization often suffer from either poor stability in visual Structure from Motion (SfM) or fragility in solving a huge number of parameters simultaneously. To address these challenges, we propose a new pipeline for visual inertial initialization that robustly handles various complex scenarios. By tightly coupling gyroscope measurements, we enhance the robustness and accuracy of visual SfM. Our method demonstrates stable performance even with only four image frames, yielding competitive results. In terms of feature matching, we introduce a hybrid method that combines optical flow and descriptor-based matching. By leveraging the robustness of continuous optical flow tracking and the accuracy of descriptor matching, our approach achieves efficient, accurate, and robust tracking results. Through evaluation on multiple benchmarks, our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and success rate. Additionally, a video demonstration on mobile devices showcases the practical applicability of our approach in the field of Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality (AR/VR).</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce FastUMI, a substantial redesign of the Universal Manipulation Interface (UMI) system that addresses these challenges by enabling rapid deployment, simplifying hardware-software integration, and delivering robust performance in real-world data acquisition. Compared with UMI, FastUMI has several advantages: 1) It adopts a decoupled hardware design and incorporates extensive mechanical modifications, removing dependencies on specialized robotic components while preserving consistent observation perspectives. 2) It also refines the algorithmic pipeline by replacing complex Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) implementations with an off-the-shelf tracking module, significantly reducing deployment complexity while maintaining accuracy. 3) FastUMI includes an ecosystem for data collection, verification, and integration with both established and newly developed imitation learning algorithms, accelerating policy learning advancement. Additionally, we have open-sourced a high-quality dataset of over 10,000 real-world demonstration trajectories spanning 22 everyday tasks, forming one of the most diverse UMI-like datasets to date. Experimental results confirm that FastUMI facilitates rapid deployment, reduces operational costs and labor demands, and maintains robust performance across diverse manipulation scenarios, thereby advancing scalable data-driven robotic learning.</p></details> |  |

The framework comprises four main components: VIO Front End, 2D Gaussian Map, NVS Loop Closure, and Dynamic Eraser. In the VIO Front End, RGB frames are processed through dense bundle adjustment and uncertainty estimation to extract scene geometry and poses. Based on this output, the mapping module incrementally constructs and maintains a 2D Gaussian map. Key components of the 2D Gaussian Map include a Sample-based Rasterizer, Score Manager, and Pose Refinement, which collectively improve mapping speed and localization accuracy. This enables the SLAM system to handle large-scale urban environments with up to 50 million Gaussian ellipsoids. To ensure global consistency in large-scale scenes, we design a Loop Closure module, which innovatively leverages the Novel View Synthesis (NVS) capabilities of Gaussian Splatting for loop closure detection and correction of the Gaussian map. Additionally, we propose a Dynamic Eraser to address the inevitable presence of dynamic objects in real-world outdoor scenes. Extensive evaluations in indoor and outdoor environments demonstrate that our approach achieves localization performance on par with Visual-Inertial Odometry while surpassing recent GS/NeRF SLAM methods. It also significantly outperforms all existing methods in terms of mapping and rendering quality. Furthermore, we developed a mobile app and verified that our framework can generate high-quality Gaussian maps in real time using only a smartphone camera and a low-frequency IMU sensor. To the best of our knowledge, VINGS-Mono is the first monocular Gaussian SLAM method capable of operating in outdoor environments and supporting kilometer-scale large scenes.</p></details> |  |

They also have multi-joint legs and variable height bodies that make them good candidates for tasks such as stairs climbing and squeezing under objects in a typical home environment or an attic. Expanding on our previous work on joist climbing in attics, we train a legged hexapod equipped with a depth camera and visual inertial odometry (VIO) to perform three tasks: climbing stairs, avoiding obstacles, and squeezing under obstacles such as a table. Our policies are trained with simulation data only and can be deployed on lowcost hardware not requiring real-time joint state feedback. We train our model in a teacher-student model with 2 phases: In phase 1, we use reinforcement learning with access to privileged information such as height maps and joint feedback. In phase 2, we use supervised learning to distill the model into one with access to only onboard observations, consisting of egocentric depth images and robot pose captured by a tracking VIO camera. By manipulating available privileged information, constructing simulation terrains, and refining reward functions during phase 1 training, we are able to train the robots with skills that are robust in non-ideal physical environments. We demonstrate successful sim-to-real transfer and achieve high success rates across all three tasks in physical experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Drift-free Visual SLAM using Digital Twins](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08496v2)** | 2024-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Globally-consistent localization in urban environments is crucial for autonomous systems such as self-driving vehicles and drones, as well as assistive technologies for visually impaired people. Traditional Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) and Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (VSLAM) methods, though adequate for local pose estimation, suffer from drift in the long term due to reliance on local sensor data. While GPS counteracts this drift, it is unavailable indoors and often unreliable in urban areas. An alternative is to localize the camera to an existing 3D map using visual-feature matching. This can provide centimeter-level accurate localization but is limited by the visual similarities between the current view and the map. This paper introduces a novel approach that achieves accurate and globally-consistent localization by aligning the sparse 3D point cloud generated by the VIO/VSLAM system to a digital twin using point-to-plane matching; no visual data association is needed. The proposed method provides a 6-DoF global measurement tightly integrated into the VIO/VSLAM system. Experiments run on a high-fidelity GPS simulator and real-world data collected from a drone demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art VIO-GPS systems and offers superior robustness against viewpoint changes compared to the state-of-the-art Visual SLAM systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Aerial Collaborative Stereo: Real-Time Cross-Camera Feature Association and Relative Pose Estimation for UAVs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17504v2)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The collaborative visual perception of multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has increasingly become a research hotspot. Compared to a single UAV equipped with a short-baseline stereo camera, multi-UAV collaborative vision offers a wide and variable baseline, providing potential benefits in flexible and large-scale depth perception. In this paper, we propose the concept of a collaborative stereo camera, where the left and right cameras are mounted on two UAVs that share an overlapping FOV. Considering the dynamic flight of two UAVs in the real world, the FOV and relative pose of the left and right cameras are continuously changing. Compared to fixed-baseline stereo cameras, this aerial collaborative stereo system introduces two challenges, which are highly real-time requirements for dynamic cross-camera stereo feature association and relative pose estimation of left and right cameras. To address these challenges, we first propose a real-time dual-channel feature association algorithm with a guidance-prediction structure. Then, we propose a Relative Multi-State Constrained Kalman Filter (Rel-MSCKF) algorithm to estimate the relative pose by fusing co-visual features and UAVs' visual-inertial odometry (VIO). Extensive experiments are performed on the popular onboard computer NVIDIA NX. Results on the resource-constrained platform show that the real-time performance of the dual-channel feature association is significantly superior to traditional methods. The convergence of Rel-MSCKF is assessed under different initial baseline errors. In the end, we present a potential application of aerial collaborative stereo for remote mapping obstacles in urban scenarios. We hope this work can serve as a foundational study for more multi-UAV collaborative vision research. Online video: https://youtu.be/avxMuOf5Qcw</p></details> | 13 pages |

However, during long-term use, irreversible structural deformation caused by temperature changes, mechanical squeezing, etc. will cause changes in extrinsic parameters, especially in the rotational part. Existing initialization methods that simultaneously estimate extrinsic parameters suffer from poor robustness, low precision, and long initialization latency due to the need for sufficient translational motion. To address these problems, we propose a novel VIO initialization method, which jointly considers extrinsic orientation and gyroscope bias within the normal epipolar constraints, achieving higher precision and better robustness without delayed rotational calibration. First, a rotation-only constraint is designed for extrinsic orientation and gyroscope bias estimation, which tightly couples gyroscope measurements and visual observations and can be solved in pure-rotation cases. Second, we propose a weighting strategy together with a failure detection strategy to enhance the precision and robustness of the estimator. Finally, we leverage Maximum A Posteriori to refine the results before enough translation parallax comes. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and robustness while maintaining competitive efficiency.</p></details> |  |

The cutting-edge DU-VIO framework is incorporating a GAN-based pre-processing module and a hybrid CNN-LSTM module for precise pose estimation, using visibility-enhanced underwater images and raw IMU data. Accurate pose estimation is paramount for various underwater robotics and exploration applications. However, underwater visibility is often compromised by suspended particles and attenuation effects, rendering visual-inertial pose estimation a formidable challenge. DU-VIO aims to overcome these limitations by effectively removing visual disturbances from raw image data, enhancing the quality of image features used for pose estimation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DU-VIO by calculating RMSE scores for translation and rotation vectors in comparison to their reference values. These scores are then compared to those of a base model using a modified AQUALOC Dataset. This study's significance lies in its potential to revolutionize underwater robotics and exploration. DU-VIO offers a robust solution to the persistent challenge of underwater visibility, significantly improving the accuracy of pose estimation. This research contributes valuable insights and tools for advancing underwater technology, with far-reaching implications for scientific research, environmental monitoring, and industrial applications.</p></details> |  |

Global Positioning Systems such as GPS and GNSS have been typically used in fusion with Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) for PE. However, the low update rate and lack of proper signals make their utility impractical for indoor and urban applications. On the other hand, Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) is gaining popularity as a practical alternative for GNSS/INS systems in GPS-denied environments. Among the many VIO-based methods, the Multi-State Constraint Kalman Filter (MSCKF) has received a greater attention due to its robustness, speed and accuracy. To this end, the high computational cost associated with image processing for real-time implementation of MSCKF on resource-constrained vehicles is still a challenging ongoing research. In this paper, an enhanced version of the MSCKF is proposed. To this aim, different feature marginalization and state pruning strategies are suggested that result in a much faster algorithm. The proposed algorithm is tested both on an open-source dataset and in real-world experiments for validation. It is demonstrated that the proposed Fast-MSCKF (FMSCKF) is about six times faster and at least 20% more accurate in final position estimation than the standard MSCKF algorithm.</p></details> |  |

While deep learning-based (DL) methods excel at inferring semantic object information from images, such as class and relative 6 degree of freedom (6-DoF) pose, they are computationally demanding and thus often not suitable for payload constrained mobile robots. In this letter we present a real-time capable unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) system for object-relative, closed-loop navigation with a minimal sensor configuration consisting of an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and RGB camera. Utilizing a DL-based object pose estimator, solely trained on synthetic data and optimized for companion board deployment, the object-relative pose measurements are fused with the IMU data to perform object-relative localization. We conduct multiple real-world experiments to validate the performance of our system for the challenging use case of power pole inspection. An example closed-loop flight is presented in the supplementary video.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L), 2024</p></details> |
| **[Fast Extrinsic Calibration for Multiple Inertial Measurement Units in Visual-Inertial System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16228v1)** | 2024-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a fast extrinsic calibration method for fusing multiple inertial measurement units (MIMU) to improve visual-inertial odometry (VIO) localization accuracy. Currently, data fusion algorithms for MIMU highly depend on the number of inertial sensors. Based on the assumption that extrinsic parameters between inertial sensors are perfectly calibrated, the fusion algorithm provides better localization accuracy with more IMUs, while neglecting the effect of extrinsic calibration error. Our method builds two non-linear least-squares problems to estimate the MIMU relative position and orientation separately, independent of external sensors and inertial noises online estimation. Then we give the general form of the virtual IMU (VIMU) method and propose its propagation on manifold. We perform our method on datasets, our self-made sensor board, and board with different IMUs, validating the superiority of our method over competing methods concerning speed, accuracy, and robustness. In the simulation experiment, we show that only fusing two IMUs with our calibration method to predict motion can rival nine IMUs. Real-world experiments demonstrate better localization accuracy of the VIO integrated with our calibration method and VIMU propagation on manifold.</p></details> |  |

However, their deployment on resource-constrained devices is non-trivial since large network parameters should be accommodated in the device memory. Furthermore, these networks may risk failure post-deployment due to environmental distribution shifts at test time. In light of this, we propose UL-VIO -- an ultra-lightweight (<1M) VIO network capable of test-time adaptation (TTA) based on visual-inertial consistency. Specifically, we perform model compression to the network while preserving the low-level encoder part, including all BatchNorm parameters for resource-efficient test-time adaptation. It achieves 36X smaller network size than state-of-the-art with a minute increase in error -- 1% on the KITTI dataset. For test-time adaptation, we propose to use the inertia-referred network outputs as pseudo labels and update the BatchNorm parameter for lightweight yet effective adaptation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to perform noise-robust TTA on VIO. Experimental results on the KITTI, EuRoC, and Marulan datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our resource-efficient adaptation method under diverse TTA scenarios with dynamic domain shifts.</p></details> |  |

Simultaneously, the approach enables on-par visual-inertial odometry performance in refractive media without prior knowledge of the refractive index or requirement of medium-specific camera calibration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 2024 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2024), 8 pages</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Visual Inertial SLAM with Magnetic Measurements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09904v1)** | 2024-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents an extension to visual inertial odometry (VIO) by introducing tightly-coupled fusion of magnetometer measurements. A sliding window of keyframes is optimized by minimizing re-projection errors, relative inertial errors, and relative magnetometer orientation errors. The results of IMU orientation propagation are used to efficiently transform magnetometer measurements between frames producing relative orientation constraints between consecutive frames. The soft and hard iron effects are calibrated using an ellipsoid fitting algorithm. The introduction of magnetometer data results in significant reductions in the orientation error and also in recovery of the true yaw orientation with respect to the magnetic north. The proposed framework operates in all environments with slow-varying magnetic fields, mainly outdoors and underwater. We have focused our work on the underwater domain, especially in underwater caves, as the narrow passage and turbulent flow make it difficult to perform loop closures and reset the localization drift. The underwater caves present challenges to VIO due to the absence of ambient light and the confined nature of the environment, while also being a crucial source of fresh water and providing valuable historical records. Experimental results from underwater caves demonstrate the improvements in accuracy and robustness introduced by the proposed VIO extension.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal Transformer for Fusion and Pose Estimation in Deep Visual Inertial Odometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08769v1)** | 2024-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, transformer-based architectures become the de facto standard for sequence modeling in deep learning frameworks. Inspired by the successful examples, we propose a causal visual-inertial fusion transformer (VIFT) for pose estimation in deep visual-inertial odometry. This study aims to improve pose estimation accuracy by leveraging the attention mechanisms in transformers, which better utilize historical data compared to the recurrent neural network (RNN) based methods seen in recent methods. Transformers typically require large-scale data for training. To address this issue, we utilize inductive biases for deep VIO networks. Since latent visual-inertial feature vectors encompass essential information for pose estimation, we employ transformers to refine pose estimates by updating latent vectors temporally. Our study also examines the impact of data imbalance and rotation learning methods in supervised end-to-end learning of visual inertial odometry by utilizing specialized gradients in backpropagation for the elements of SE$(3)$ group. The proposed method is end-to-end trainable and requires only a monocular camera and IMU during inference. Experimental results demonstrate that VIFT increases the accuracy of monocular VIO networks, achieving state-of-the-art results when compared to previous methods on the KITTI dataset. The code will be made available at https://github.com/ybkurt/VIFT.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ECCV 2024 2nd Workshop on Vision-Centric Autonomous Driving (VCAD)</p></details> |

Unlike its predecessor, the Mars 2020 mission, which relied on a state estimation system assuming planar terrain, MSH requires a novel approach due to the complex topography of the landing site. This work introduces a novel range-visual-inertial odometry system tailored for the unique challenges of the MSH mission. Our system extends the state-of-the-art xVIO framework by fusing consistent range information with visual and inertial measurements, preventing metric scale drift in the absence of visual-inertial excitation (mono camera and constant velocity descent), and enabling landing on any terrain structure, without requiring any planar terrain assumption. Through extensive testing in image-based simulations using actual terrain structure and textures collected in Mars orbit, we demonstrate that our range-VIO approach estimates terrain-relative velocity meeting the stringent mission requirements, and outperforming existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE/...</summary><p>IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots (IROS), 2024</p></details> |
| **[Robust Vehicle Localization and Tracking in Rain using Street Maps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01038v1)** | 2024-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>GPS-based vehicle localization and tracking suffers from unstable positional information commonly experienced in tunnel segments and in dense urban areas. Also, both Visual Odometry (VO) and Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO) are susceptible to adverse weather conditions that causes occlusions or blur on the visual input. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for vehicle localization that uses street network based map information to correct drifting odometry estimates and intermittent GPS measurements especially, in adversarial scenarios such as driving in rain and tunnels. Specifically, our approach is a flexible fusion algorithm that integrates intermittent GPS, drifting IMU and VO estimates together with 2D map information for robust vehicle localization and tracking. We refer to our approach as Map-Fusion. We robustly evaluate our proposed approach on four geographically diverse datasets from different countries ranging across clear and rain weather conditions. These datasets also include challenging visual segments in tunnels and underpasses. We show that with the integration of the map information, our Map-Fusion algorithm reduces the error of the state-of-the-art VO and VIO approaches across all datasets. We also validate our proposed algorithm in a real-world environment and in real-time on a hardware constrained mobile robot. Map-Fusion achieved 2.46m error in clear weather and 6.05m error in rain weather for a 150m route.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fusion of Visual-Inertial Odometry with LiDAR Relative Localization for Cooperative Guidance of a Micro-Scale Aerial Vehicle](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17544v2)** | 2024-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A novel relative localization approach for guidance of a micro-scale UAV by a well-equipped aerial robot fusing VIO with LiDAR is proposed in this paper. LiDAR-based localization is accurate and robust to challenging environmental conditions, but 3D LiDARs are relatively heavy and require large UAV platforms, in contrast to lightweight cameras. However, visual-based self-localization methods exhibit lower accuracy and can suffer from significant drift with respect to the global reference frame. To benefit from both sensory modalities, we focus on cooperative navigation in a heterogeneous team of a primary LiDAR-equipped UAV and a secondary micro-scale camera-equipped UAV. We propose a novel cooperative approach combining LiDAR relative localization data with VIO output on board the primary UAV to obtain an accurate pose of the secondary UAV. The pose estimate is used to precisely and reliably guide the secondary UAV along trajectories defined in the primary UAV reference frame. The experimental evaluation has shown the superior accuracy of our method to the raw VIO output and demonstrated its capability to guide the secondary UAV along desired trajectories while mitigating VIO drift. Thus, such a heterogeneous system can explore large areas with LiDAR precision, as well as visit locations inaccessible to the large LiDAR-carrying UAV platforms, as was showcased in a real-world cooperative mapping scenario.</p></details> | <details><summary>pre-p...</summary><p>pre-print submitted to Journal of Intelligent and Robotic Systems</p></details> |

However, the computational cost of NeRF rendering and degradation in quality due to the presence of artifacts pose significant challenges for its application in real-time and robust robotic tasks, especially on embedded systems. This paper introduces a novel framework that integrates NeRF-derived localization information with Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) to provide a robust solution for real-time robotic navigation. By training an absolute pose regression network with augmented image data rendered from a NeRF and quantifying its uncertainty, our approach effectively counters positional drift and enhances system reliability. We also establish a mathematically sound foundation for combining visual inertial navigation with camera localization neural networks, considering uncertainty under a Bayesian framework. Experimental validation in a photorealistic simulation environment demonstrates significant improvements in accuracy compared to a conventional VIO approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IROS 2024, 8 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Planes are commonplace in man-made environments, offering an active means to reduce drift, due to their extensive spatial and temporal observability. To make full use of planar information, we propose a novel visual-inertial odometry (VIO) using an RGBD camera and an inertial measurement unit (IMU), effectively integrating point and plane features in an extended Kalman filter (EKF) framework. Depth information of point features is leveraged to improve the accuracy of point triangulation, while plane features serve as direct observations added into the state vector. Notably, to benefit long-term navigation,a novel graph-based drift detection strategy is proposed to search overlapping and identical structures in the plane map so that the cumulative drift is suppressed subsequently. The experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate that our system outperforms state-of-the-art methods in localization accuracy and meanwhile generates a compact and consistent plane map, free of expensive global bundle adjustment and loop closing techniques.</p></details> |  |

We present a method that adapts to camera motion and allows high-quality scene reconstruction with handheld video data suffering from motion blur and rolling shutter distortion. Our approach is based on detailed modelling of the physical image formation process and utilizes velocities estimated using visual-inertial odometry (VIO). Camera poses are considered non-static during the exposure time of a single image frame and camera poses are further optimized in the reconstruction process. We formulate a differentiable rendering pipeline that leverages screen space approximation to efficiently incorporate rolling-shutter and motion blur effects into the 3DGS framework. Our results with both synthetic and real data demonstrate superior performance in mitigating camera motion over existing methods, thereby advancing 3DGS in naturalistic settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Sourc...</summary><p>Source code available at https://github.com/SpectacularAI/3dgs-deblur</p></details> |

For a drone equipped with monocular camera and an UGV equipped with LiDAR as an external sensor, we propose a robust and real-time relative pose estimation method (LVCP) based on the tight coupling of vision and LiDAR point cloud information, which does not require prior information such as maps or precise initial poses. Given that large-scale point clouds generated by 3D sensors has more accurate spatial geometric information than the feature point cloud generated by image, we utilize LiDAR point clouds to correct the drift in visual-inertial odometry (VIO) when the camera undergoes significant shaking or the IMU has a low signal-to-noise ratio. To achieve this, we propose a novel coarse-to-fine framework for LiDAR-vision collaborative localization. In this framework, we construct point-plane association based on spatial geometric information, and innovatively construct a point-aided Bundle Adjustment (BA) problem as the backend to simultaneously estimate the relative pose of the camera and LiDAR and correct the VIO drift. In this process, we propose a particle swarm optimization (PSO) based sampling algorithm to complete the coarse estimation of the current camera-LiDAR pose. In this process, the initial pose of the camera used for sampling is obtained based on VIO propagation, and the valid feature-plane association number (VFPN) is used to trigger PSO-sampling process. Additionally, we propose a method that combines Structure from Motion (SFM) and multi-level sampling to initialize the algorithm, addressing the challenge of lacking initial values.</p></details> | <details><summary>See m...</summary><p>See more details in https://sites.google.com/view/lvcp</p></details> |

For parking scenarios, dynamic lighting, sparse textures, and the instability of global positioning system (GPS) signals pose challenges for most traditional localization methods. To address these difficulties, we propose VIPS-Odom, a novel semantic visual-inertial odometry framework for underground autonomous parking, which adopts tightly-coupled optimization to fuse measurements from multi-modal sensors and solves odometry. Our VIPS-Odom integrates parking slots detected from the synthesized bird-eye-view (BEV) image with traditional feature points in the frontend, and conducts tightly-coupled optimization with joint constraints introduced by measurements from the inertial measurement unit, wheel speed sensor and parking slots in the backend. We develop a multi-object tracking framework to robustly track parking slots' states. To prove the superiority of our method, we equip an electronic vehicle with related sensors and build an experimental platform based on ROS2 system. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy and advantages of our method compared with other baselines for parking scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>A SLA...</summary><p>A SLAM Method for Autonomous Parking</p></details> |

Though modern optimization-based algorithms have achieved superior accuracy, the MSCKF-based VIO algorithms are still widely demanded for their efficient and consistent performance. As MSCKF is built upon the conventional multi-view geometry, the measured residuals are not only related to the state errors but also related to the feature position errors. To apply EKF fusion, a projection process is required to remove the feature position error from the observation model, which can lead to model and accuracy degradation. To obtain an efficient visual-inertial fusion model, while also preserving the model consistency, we propose to reconstruct the MSCKF VIO with the novel Pose-Only (PO) multi-view geometry description. In the newly constructed filter, we have modeled PO reprojection residuals, which are solely related to the motion states and thus overcome the requirements of space projection. Moreover, the new filter does not require any feature position information, which removes the computational cost and linearization errors brought in by the 3D reconstruction procedure. We have conducted comprehensive experiments on multiple datasets, where the proposed method has shown accuracy improvements and consistent performance in challenging sequences.</p></details> |  |

A crucial subtask within VIO is the tracking of features, which can be achieved through Optical Flow (OF). As the calculation of OF is a resource-demanding task in terms of computational load and memory footprint, which needs to be executed at low latency, especially in robotic applications, OF estimation is today performed on powerful CPUs or GPUs. This restricts its use in a broad spectrum of applications where the deployment of such powerful, power-hungry processors is unfeasible due to constraints related to cost, size, and power consumption. On-sensor hardware acceleration is a promising approach to enable low latency VIO even on resource-constrained devices such as nano drones. This paper assesses the speed-up in a VIO sensor system exploiting a compact OF sensor consisting of a global shutter camera and an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC). By replacing the feature tracking logic of the VINS-Mono pipeline with data from this OF camera, we demonstrate a 49.4% reduction in latency and a 53.7% reduction of compute load of the VIO pipeline over the original VINS-Mono implementation, allowing VINS-Mono operation up to 50 FPS instead of 20 FPS on the quad-core ARM Cortex-A72 processor of a Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This article has been accepted for publication in the IEEE Sensors Journal (JSEN)</p></details> |

Thanks to a passive detachable mechanism, the interface can be attached/detached from a robot, offering two control modes: local control (attached) and teleoperation (detached). These modes are integrated with a robot whole-body controller and presented in a unified close- and far-proximity control framework for MCR. The earlier introduction of the haptic component in this interface enabled users to execute intricate loco-manipulation tasks via admittance-type control, effectively decoupling task dynamics and enhancing human capabilities. In contrast, this ongoing work proposes a novel design that integrates a visual component. This design utilizes Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) for teleoperation, estimating the interface's pose through stereo cameras and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). The estimated pose serves as the reference for the robot's end-effector in teleoperation mode. Hence, the interface offers complete flexibility and adaptability, enabling any user to operate an MCR seamlessly without needing expert knowledge. In this letter, we primarily focus on the new visual feature, and first present a performance evaluation of different VIO-based methods for teleoperation. Next, the interface's usability is analyzed in a home-care application and compared to an alternative designed by a commercial MoCap system. Results show comparable performance in terms of accuracy, completion time, and usability. Nevertheless, the proposed interface is low-cost, poses minimal wearability constraints, and can be used anywhere and anytime without needing external devices or additional equipment, offering a versatile and accessible solution for teleoperation.</p></details> |  |

However, existing VIO methods lack the generalization ability to adjust to different environments and sensor attributes. In this paper, we propose Adaptive VIO, a new monocular visual-inertial odometry that combines online continual learning with traditional nonlinear optimization. Adaptive VIO comprises two networks to predict visual correspondence and IMU bias. Unlike end-to-end approaches that use networks to fuse the features from two modalities (camera and IMU) and predict poses directly, we combine neural networks with visual-inertial bundle adjustment in our VIO system. The optimized estimates will be fed back to the visual and IMU bias networks, refining the networks in a self-supervised manner. Such a learning-optimization-combined framework and feedback mechanism enable the system to perform online continual learning. Experiments demonstrate that our Adaptive VIO manifests adaptive capability on EuRoC and TUM-VI datasets. The overall performance exceeds the currently known learning-based VIO methods and is comparable to the state-of-the-art optimization-based methods.</p></details> |  |

Although in recent years, many works have been focusing on improving one of the most widely adopted state estimation methods, visual inertial odometry (VIO), by incorporating multiple cameras, these efforts predominantly address synchronous camera systems. Asynchronous cameras, which offer simpler hardware configurations and enhanced resilience, have been largely overlooked. To fill this gap, this paper presents VINS-Multi, a novel multi-camera-IMU state estimator for asynchronous cameras. The estimator comprises parallel front ends, a front end coordinator, and a back end optimization module capable of handling asynchronous input frames. It utilizes the frames effectively through a dynamic feature number allocation and a frame priority coordination strategy. The proposed estimator is integrated into a customized quadrotor platform and tested in multiple realistic and challenging scenarios to validate its practicality.

However, its performance under varying network setups, especially when combined with IMU data for real-time localization, has not been fully explored so far. In this study, we develop an error state Kalman filter (ESKF) and a pose graph optimization (PGO) approach to address this gap. We systematically evaluate the performance of the derived approaches for real-time MAV localization in realistic scenarios with 5G base stations in Line-Of-Sight (LOS), demonstrating the potential of 5G technologies in this domain. In order to experimentally test and compare our localization approaches, we augment the EuRoC MAV benchmark dataset for visual-inertial odometry with simulated yet highly realistic 5G ToA measurements. Our experimental results comprehensively assess the impact of varying network setups, including varying base station numbers and network configurations, on ToA-based MAV localization performance. The findings show promising results for seamless and robust localization using 5G ToA measurements, achieving an accuracy of 15 cm throughout the entire trajectory within a graph-based framework with five 5G base stations, and an accuracy of up to 34 cm in the case of ESKF-based localization. Additionally, we measure the run time of both algorithms and show that they are both fast enough for real-time implementation.</p></details> |  |

In this paper we approximate distributions at different points in the group in a single set of exponential coordinates and then use classical Gaussian fusion to obtain the fused posteriori in those coordinates. We consider several approximations including the exact Jacobian of the change of coordinate map, first and second order Taylor's expansions of the Jacobian, and parallel transport with and without curvature correction associated with the underlying geometry of the Lie group. Preliminary results on SO(3) demonstrate that a novel approximation using parallel transport with curvature correction achieves similar accuracy to the state-of-the-art optimisation based algorithms at a fraction of the computational cost.</p></details> | Preprint for L-CSS |

It combines visual and inertial measurements to accurately estimate position and orientation. Existing VIO methods assume a fixed noise covariance for the inertial uncertainty. However, accurately determining in real-time the noise variance of the inertial sensors presents a significant challenge as the uncertainty changes throughout the operation leading to suboptimal performance and reduced accuracy. To circumvent this, we propose VIO-DualProNet, a novel approach that utilizes deep learning methods to dynamically estimate the inertial noise uncertainty in real-time. By designing and training a deep neural network to predict inertial noise uncertainty using only inertial sensor measurements, and integrating it into the VINS-Mono algorithm, we demonstrate a substantial improvement in accuracy and robustness, enhancing VIO performance and potentially benefiting other VIO-based systems for precise localization and mapping across diverse conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 15 figures, bib file</p></details> |
| **[KS-APR: Keyframe Selection for Robust Absolute Pose Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05459v2)** | 2024-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Markerless Mobile Augmented Reality (AR) aims to anchor digital content in the physical world without using specific 2D or 3D objects. Absolute Pose Regressors (APR) are end-to-end machine learning solutions that infer the device's pose from a single monocular image. Thanks to their low computation cost, they can be directly executed on the constrained hardware of mobile AR devices. However, APR methods tend to yield significant inaccuracies for input images that are too distant from the training set. This paper introduces KS-APR, a pipeline that assesses the reliability of an estimated pose with minimal overhead by combining the inference results of the APR and the prior images in the training set. Mobile AR systems tend to rely upon visual-inertial odometry to track the relative pose of the device during the experience. As such, KS-APR favours reliability over frequency, discarding unreliable poses. This pipeline can integrate most existing APR methods to improve accuracy by filtering unreliable images with their pose estimates. We implement the pipeline on three types of APR models on indoor and outdoor datasets. The median error on position and orientation is reduced for all models, and the proportion of large errors is minimized across datasets. Our method enables state-of-the-art APRs such as DFNetdm to outperform single-image and sequential APR methods. These results demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of KS-APR for visual localization tasks that do not require one-shot decisions.</p></details> |  |
| **[3D Freehand Ultrasound using Visual Inertial and Deep Inertial Odometry for Measuring Patellar Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15847v1)** | 2024-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Patellofemoral joint (PFJ) issues affect one in four people, with 20% experiencing chronic knee pain despite treatment. Poor outcomes and pain after knee replacement surgery are often linked to patellar mal-tracking. Traditional imaging methods like CT and MRI face challenges, including cost and metal artefacts, and there's currently no ideal way to observe joint motion without issues such as soft tissue artefacts or radiation exposure. A new system to monitor joint motion could significantly improve understanding of PFJ dynamics, aiding in better patient care and outcomes. Combining 2D ultrasound with motion tracking for 3D reconstruction of the joint using semantic segmentation and position registration can be a solution. However, the need for expensive external infrastructure to estimate the trajectories of the scanner remains the main limitation to implementing 3D bone reconstruction from handheld ultrasound scanning clinically. We proposed the Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) and the deep learning-based inertial-only odometry methods as alternatives to motion capture for tracking a handheld ultrasound scanner. The 3D reconstruction generated by these methods has demonstrated potential for assessing the PFJ and for further measurements from free-hand ultrasound scans. The results show that the VIO method performs as well as the motion capture method, with average reconstruction errors of 1.25 mm and 1.21 mm, respectively. The VIO method is the first infrastructure-free method for 3D reconstruction of bone from wireless handheld ultrasound scanning with an accuracy comparable to methods that require external infrastructure.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Medical Measurements & Applications (MeMeA) 2024</p></details> |

Despite their advancements, these methods often encounter dead-reckoning errors that leads to considerable drift in estimated platform motion especially during long traverses. In such cases, the drift error is not negligible and should be rectified. Our proposed approach minimizes the drift error by correcting the estimated motion generated by any SLAM method at each epoch. Our methodology treats positioning measurements rendered by the SLAM solution as random variables formulated jointly in a multivariate distribution. In this setting, The correction of the drift becomes equivalent to finding the mode of this multivariate distribution which jointly maximizes the likelihood of a set of relevant geo-spatial priors about the platform motion and environment. Our method is integrable into any SLAM/VIO method as an correction module. Our experimental results shows the effectiveness of our approach in minimizing the drift error by 10x in long treverses.</p></details> |  |

Such temporal misalignment introduces inconsistent constraints for state estimation, leading to a significant positioning drift especially in high dynamic motion scenarios. In this article, we focus on online temporal calibration to reduce the positioning drift caused by the time offset for high dynamic motion VIO. For the time offset observation model, most existing methods rely on accurate state estimation or stable visual tracking. For the prediction model, current methods oversimplify the time offset as a constant value with white Gaussian noise. However, these ideal conditions are seldom satisfied in real high dynamic scenarios, resulting in the poor performance. In this paper, we introduce online time offset modeling networks (TON) to enhance real-time temporal calibration. TON improves the accuracy of time offset observation and prediction modeling. Specifically, for observation modeling, we propose feature velocity observation networks to enhance velocity computation for features in unstable visual tracking conditions. For prediction modeling, we present time offset prediction networks to learn its evolution pattern. To highlight the effectiveness of our method, we integrate the proposed TON into both optimization-based and filter-based VIO systems. Simulation and real-world experiments are conducted to demonstrate the enhanced performance of our approach. Additionally, to contribute to the VIO community, we will open-source the code of our method on: https://github.com/Franky-X/FVON-TPN.</p></details> |  |

The purpose of our research is to unleash the potential of point-line odometry with large-FoV omnidirectional cameras, even for cameras with negative-plane FoV. To achieve this, we propose an Omnidirectional Curve Segment Detection (OCSD) method combined with a camera model which is applicable to images with large distortions, such as panoramic annular images, fisheye images, and various panoramic images. The geodesic segment is sliced into multiple straight-line segments based on the radian and descriptors are extracted and recombined.

The proposed HDA_LVIO system can be divided into two subsystems: the LiDAR-Inertial subsystem (LIS) and the Visual-Inertial subsystem (VIS). In the LIS, the LiDAR pointcloud is utilized to calculate the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) error, serving as the measurement value of Error State Iterated Kalman Filter (ESIKF) to construct the global map. In the VIS, an incremental method is firstly employed to adaptively extract planes from the global map. And the centroids of these planes are projected onto the image to obtain projection points. Then, feature points are extracted from the image and tracked along with projection points using Lucas-Kanade (LK) optical flow. Next, leveraging the vehicle states from previous intervals, sliding window optimization is performed to estimate the depth of feature points. Concurrently, a method based on epipolar geometric constraints is proposed to address tracking failures for feature points, which can improve the accuracy of depth estimation for feature points by ensuring sufficient parallax within the sliding window. Subsequently, the feature points and projection points are hybridly associated to construct reprojection error, serving as the measurement value of ESIKF to estimate vehicle states. Finally, the localization accuracy of the proposed HDA-LVIO is validated using public datasets and data from our equipment. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves obviously improvement in localization accuracy compared to various existing algorithms.</p></details> |  |

Despite event-based visual odometry having been extensively studied in recent years, most of them are based on monocular and few research on stereo event vision. In this paper, we present ESVIO, the first event-based stereo visual-inertial odometry, which leverages the complementary advantages of event streams, standard images and inertial measurements. Our proposed pipeline achieves temporal tracking and instantaneous matching between consecutive stereo event streams, thereby obtaining robust state estimation. In addition, the motion compensation method is designed to emphasize the edge of scenes by warping each event to reference moments with IMU and ESVIO back-end. We validate that both ESIO (purely event-based) and ESVIO (event with image-aided) have superior performance compared with other image-based and event-based baseline methods on public and self-collected datasets. Furthermore, we use our pipeline to perform onboard quadrotor flights under low-light environments. A real-world large-scale experiment is also conducted to demonstrate long-term effectiveness. We highlight that this work is a real-time, accurate system that is aimed at robust state estimation under challenging environments.</p></details> |  |

Existing fixed-class models limit the adaptability of indoor mobile and assistive autonomous systems. In this work, we introduce LEXIS, a real-time indoor Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) system that harnesses the open-vocabulary nature of Large Language Models (LLMs) to create a unified approach to scene understanding and place recognition. The approach first builds a topological SLAM graph of the environment (using visual-inertial odometry) and embeds Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) features in the graph nodes. We use this representation for flexible room classification and segmentation, serving as a basis for room-centric place recognition. This allows loop closure searches to be directed towards semantically relevant places. Our proposed system is evaluated using both public, simulated data and real-world data, covering office and home environments. It successfully categorizes rooms with varying layouts and dimensions and outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA). For place recognition and trajectory estimation tasks we achieve equivalent performance to the SOTA, all also utilizing the same pre-trained model.

Autonomous drone racing has emerged as an ideal benchmark to develop and evaluate these capabilities. Its challenges include accurate and robust visual-inertial odometry during aggressive maneuvers, complex aerodynamics, and constrained computational resources. As researchers increasingly channel their efforts into it, they also need the tools to timely and equitably compare their results and advances.

In this work, we design a novel visual-inertial odometry (VIO) system called RD-VIO to handle both of these two problems. Firstly, we propose an IMU-PARSAC algorithm which can robustly detect and match keypoints in a two-stage process. In the first state, landmarks are matched with new keypoints using visual and IMU measurements. We collect statistical information from the matching and then guide the intra-keypoint matching in the second stage. Secondly, to handle the problem of pure rotation, we detect the motion type and adapt the deferred-triangulation technique during the data-association process. We make the pure-rotational frames into the special subframes. When solving the visual-inertial bundle adjustment, they provide additional constraints to the pure-rotational motion. We evaluate the proposed VIO system on public datasets and online comparison. Experiments show the proposed RD-VIO has obvious advantages over other methods in dynamic environments.

However, accurate absolute pose estimation techniques are computation- and storage-heavy, requiring computation offloading. As such, AR systems rely on visual-inertial odometry (VIO) to track the device's relative pose between requests to the server. However, VIO suffers from drift, requiring frequent absolute repositioning. This paper introduces MobileARLoc, a new framework for on-device large-scale markerless mobile AR that combines an absolute pose regressor (APR) with a local VIO tracking system. Absolute pose regressors (APRs) provide fast on-device pose estimation at the cost of reduced accuracy. To address APR accuracy and reduce VIO drift, MobileARLoc creates a feedback loop where VIO pose estimations refine the APR predictions. The VIO system identifies reliable predictions of APR, which are then used to compensate for the VIO drift. We comprehensively evaluate MobileARLoc through dataset simulations. MobileARLoc halves the error compared to the underlying APR and achieve fast (80\,ms) on-device inference speed.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the 3rd edition of the Pervasive and Resource-Constrained AI (PerConAI) workshop (co-located with PerCom 2024).

| **[SemanticSLAM: Learning based Semantic Map Construction and Robust Camera Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13076v1)** | 2024-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current techniques in Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (VSLAM) estimate camera displacement by comparing image features of consecutive scenes. These algorithms depend on scene continuity, hence requires frequent camera inputs. However, processing images frequently can lead to significant memory usage and computation overhead. In this study, we introduce SemanticSLAM, an end-to-end visual-inertial odometry system that utilizes semantic features extracted from an RGB-D sensor. This approach enables the creation of a semantic map of the environment and ensures reliable camera localization. SemanticSLAM is scene-agnostic, which means it doesn't require retraining for different environments. It operates effectively in indoor settings, even with infrequent camera input, without prior knowledge. The strength of SemanticSLAM lies in its ability to gradually refine the semantic map and improve pose estimation. This is achieved by a convolutional long-short-term-memory (ConvLSTM) network, trained to correct errors during map construction. Compared to existing VSLAM algorithms, SemanticSLAM improves pose estimation by 17%. The resulting semantic map provides interpretable information about the environment and can be easily applied to various downstream tasks, such as path planning, obstacle avoidance, and robot navigation.

| **[Tight Fusion of Events and Inertial Measurements for Direct Velocity Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09296v1)** | 2024-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional visual-inertial state estimation targets absolute camera poses and spatial landmark locations while first-order kinematics are typically resolved as an implicitly estimated sub-state. However, this poses a risk in velocity-based control scenarios, as the quality of the estimation of kinematics depends on the stability of absolute camera and landmark coordinates estimation. To address this issue, we propose a novel solution to tight visual-inertial fusion directly at the level of first-order kinematics by employing a dynamic vision sensor instead of a normal camera. More specifically, we leverage trifocal tensor geometry to establish an incidence relation that directly depends on events and camera velocity, and demonstrate how velocity estimates in highly dynamic situations can be obtained over short time intervals. Noise and outliers are dealt with using a nested two-layer RANSAC scheme. Additionally, smooth velocity signals are obtained from a tight fusion with pre-integrated inertial signals using a sliding window optimizer. Experiments on both simulated and real data demonstrate that the proposed tight event-inertial fusion leads to continuous and reliable velocity estimation in highly dynamic scenarios independently of absolute coordinates. Furthermore, in extreme cases, it achieves more stable and more accurate estimation of kinematics than traditional, point-position-based visual-inertial odometry.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Robotics (T-RO)</p></details> |

The applications of VIO span a diverse range, including augmented reality and indoor navigation. VIO algorithms hold the potential to facilitate navigation for visually impaired individuals in both indoor and outdoor settings. Nevertheless, state-of-the-art VIO algorithms encounter substantial challenges in dynamic environments, particularly in densely populated corridors.

We define a symmetry group and corresponding group action that allow specifically the design of an equivariant filter for the problem of visual-inertial odometry (VIO) including IMU bias, and camera intrinsic and extrinsic calibration states. In contrast to state-of-the-art invariant extended Kalman filter (IEKF) approaches that simply tack IMU bias and other states onto the $\mathbf{SE}_2(3)$ group, our filter builds upon a symmetry that properly includes all the states in the group structure. Thus, we achieve improved behavior, particularly when linearization points largely deviate from the truth (i.e., on transients upon state disturbances). Our approach is inherently consistent even during convergence phases from significant errors without the need for error uncertainty adaptation, observability constraint, or other consistency enforcing techniques. This leads to greatly improved estimator behavior for significant error and unexpected state changes during, e.g., long-duration missions. We evaluate our approach with a multitude of different experiments using three different prominent real-world datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L), 2023</p></details> |
| **[Homography Initialization and Dynamic Weighting Algorithm Based on a Downward-Looking Camera and IMU](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09622v1)** | 2023-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the technology in visual-inertial odometry (VIO) has matured considerably and has been widely used in many applications. However, we still encounter challenges when applying VIO to a micro air vehicle (MAV) equipped with a downward-looking camera. Specifically, VIO cannot compute the correct initialization results during take-off and the cumulative drift is large when the MAV is flying in the air. To overcome these problems, we propose a homographybased initialization method, which utilizes the fact that the features detected by the downward-looking camera during take-off are approximately on the same plane. Then we introduce the prior normal vector and motion field to make states more accurate. In addition, to deal with the cumulative drift, a strategy for dynamically weighting visual residuals is proposed. Finally, we evaluate our method on the collected real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that our system can be successfully initialized no matter how the MAV takes off and the positioning errors are also greatly improved.</p></details> |  |

In most human-built scenes often with low features, lines can be considered complements to points. In this paper, we present a multi-robot cooperative visual-inertial navigation system (VINS) using both point and line features. By utilizing the covariance intersection (CI) update within the multi-state constraint Kalman filter (MSCKF) framework, each robot exploits not only its own point and line measurements, but also constraints of common point and common line features observed by its neighbors. The line features are parameterized and updated by utilizing the Closest Point representation. The proposed algorithm is validated extensively in both Monte-Carlo simulations and a real-world dataset. The results show that the point-line cooperative visual-inertial odometry (PL-CVIO) outperforms the independent MSCKF and our previous work CVIO in both low-feature and rich-feature environments.</p></details> |  |

Conventional EKF-based VIO usually suffers from system inconsistency and angular drift that naturally occurs in feature-based methods. However, in man-made environments, notable structural regularities, such as lines and vanishing points, offer valuable cues for localization. To exploit these structural features effectively and maintain system consistency, we design a right invariant filter-based VIO scheme incorporating point, line, and vanishing point features. We demonstrate that the conventional additive error definition for point features can also preserve system consistency like the invariant error definition by proving a mathematically equivalent measurement model. And a similar conclusion is established for line features. Additionally, we conduct an invariant filter-based observability analysis proving that vanishing point measurement maintains unobservable directions naturally. Both simulation and real-world tests are conducted to validate our methods' pose accuracy and consistency. The experimental results validate the competitive performance of our method, highlighting its ability to deliver accurate and consistent pose estimation in man-made environments.</p></details> | ROBIO 2023 |
| **[Inertial Guided Uncertainty Estimation of Feature Correspondence in Visual-Inertial Odometry/SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03722v1)** | 2023-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual odometry and Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) has been studied as one of the most important tasks in the areas of computer vision and robotics, to contribute to autonomous navigation and augmented reality systems. In case of feature-based odometry/SLAM, a moving visual sensor observes a set of 3D points from different viewpoints, correspondences between the projected 2D points in each image are usually established by feature tracking and matching. However, since the corresponding point could be erroneous and noisy, reliable uncertainty estimation can improve the accuracy of odometry/SLAM methods. In addition, inertial measurement unit is utilized to aid the visual sensor in terms of Visual-Inertial fusion. In this paper, we propose a method to estimate the uncertainty of feature correspondence using an inertial guidance robust to image degradation caused by motion blur, illumination change and occlusion. Modeling a guidance distribution to sample possible correspondence, we fit the distribution to an energy function based on image error, yielding more robust uncertainty than conventional methods. We also demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by incorporating it into one of recent visual-inertial odometry/SLAM algorithms for public datasets.</p></details> | 12 pages |

The model is self-calibrating in real-time and is free of known correspondences or calibration targets. It is separable as a distortion model (dependent on refractive index $n$ and radial pixel coordinate) and a virtual pinhole model (as a function of $n$). We derive the self-calibration formulation leveraging epipolar constraints to estimate the refractive index and subsequently correct for distortion. Through experimental studies using an underwater robot integrating cameras and inertial sensing, the model is validated regarding the accurate estimation of the refractive index and its benefits for robust odometry estimation in an extended envelope of conditions. Lastly, we show the transition between media and the estimation of the varying refractive index online, thus allowing computer vision tasks across refractive media.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 6 figures, Submitted to the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, 2024</p></details> |

Current methods either rely heavily on GNSS, face limitations in visual-based localization due to appearance variances and stylistic dissimilarities between camera and reference imagery, or operate under the assumption of a known initial pose. In this paper, we developed a GNSS-denied localization approach for UAVs that harnesses both Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) and Visual Place Recognition (VPR) using a foundation model. This paper presents a novel vision-based pipeline that works exclusively with a nadir-facing camera, an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), and pre-existing satellite imagery for robust, accurate localization in varied environments and conditions. Our system demonstrated average localization accuracy within a $20$-meter range, with a minimum error below $1$ meter, under real-world conditions marked by drastic changes in environmental appearance and with no assumption of the vehicle's initial pose. The method is proven to be effective and robust, addressing the crucial need for reliable UAV localization in GNSS-denied environments, while also being computationally efficient enough to be deployed on resource-constrained platforms.</p></details> |  |
| **[LF-VISLAM: A SLAM Framework for Large Field-of-View Cameras with Negative Imaging Plane on Mobile Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05167v3)** | 2023-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) has become a crucial aspect in the fields of autonomous driving and robotics. One crucial component of visual SLAM is the Field-of-View (FoV) of the camera, as a larger FoV allows for a wider range of surrounding elements and features to be perceived. However, when the FoV of the camera reaches the negative half-plane, traditional methods for representing image feature points using [u,v,1]^T become ineffective. While the panoramic FoV is advantageous for loop closure, its benefits are not easily realized under large-attitude-angle differences where loop-closure frames cannot be easily matched by existing methods. As loop closure on wide-FoV panoramic data further comes with a large number of outliers, traditional outlier rejection methods are not directly applicable. To address these issues, we propose LF-VISLAM, a Visual Inertial SLAM framework for cameras with extremely Large FoV with loop closure. A three-dimensional vector with unit length is introduced to effectively represent feature points even on the negative half-plane. The attitude information of the SLAM system is leveraged to guide the feature point detection of the loop closure. Additionally, a new outlier rejection method based on the unit length representation is integrated into the loop closure module. We collect the PALVIO dataset using a Panoramic Annular Lens (PAL) system with an entire FoV of 360{\deg}x(40{\deg}~120{\deg}) and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) for Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO) to address the lack of panoramic SLAM datasets. Experiments on the established PALVIO and public datasets show that the proposed LF-VISLAM outperforms state-of-the-art SLAM methods.

| **[PL-EVIO: Robust Monocular Event-based Visual Inertial Odometry with Point and Line Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12160v2)** | 2023-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event cameras are motion-activated sensors that capture pixel-level illumination changes instead of the intensity image with a fixed frame rate. Compared with the standard cameras, it can provide reliable visual perception during high-speed motions and in high dynamic range scenarios. However, event cameras output only a little information or even noise when the relative motion between the camera and the scene is limited, such as in a still state. While standard cameras can provide rich perception information in most scenarios, especially in good lighting conditions. These two cameras are exactly complementary. In this paper, we proposed a robust, high-accurate, and real-time optimization-based monocular event-based visual-inertial odometry (VIO) method with event-corner features, line-based event features, and point-based image features. The proposed method offers to leverage the point-based features in the nature scene and line-based features in the human-made scene to provide more additional structure or constraints information through well-design feature management. Experiments in the public benchmark datasets show that our method can achieve superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art image-based or event-based VIO. Finally, we used our method to demonstrate an onboard closed-loop autonomous quadrotor flight and large-scale outdoor experiments. Videos of the evaluations are presented on our project website: https://b23.tv/OE3QM6j</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Localization with Visual-Inertial Odometry Constraints for Markerless Mobile AR](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05394v2)** | 2023-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO) is an essential component of modern Augmented Reality (AR) applications. However, VIO only tracks the relative pose of the device, leading to drift over time. Absolute pose estimation methods infer the device's absolute pose, but their accuracy depends on the input quality. This paper introduces VIO-APR, a new framework for markerless mobile AR that combines an absolute pose regressor (APR) with a local VIO tracking system. VIO-APR uses VIO to assess the reliability of the APR and the APR to identify and compensate for VIO drift. This feedback loop results in more accurate positioning and more stable AR experiences. To evaluate VIO-APR, we created a dataset that combines camera images with ARKit's VIO system output for six indoor and outdoor scenes of various scales. Over this dataset, VIO-APR improves the median accuracy of popular APR by up to 36\% in position and 29\% in orientation, increases the percentage of frames in the high ($0.25 m, 2^{\circ}$) accuracy level by up to 112\% and reduces the percentage of frames predicted below the low ($5 m, 10^\circ$) accuracy greatly. We implement VIO-APR into a mobile AR application using Unity to demonstrate its capabilities. VIO-APR results in noticeably more accurate localization and a more stable overall experience.</p></details> |  |

We propose a sparse point aided multi-view stereo neural network (SPA-MVSNet) that can effectively leverage the informative but noisy sparse points from the VIO system. The sparse depth from VIO is firstly completed by a single-view depth completion network. This dense depth map, although naturally limited in accuracy, is then used as a prior to guide our MVS network in the cost volume generation and regularization for accurate dense depth prediction. Predicted depth maps of keyframe images by the MVS network are incrementally fused into a global map using TSDF-Fusion. We extensively evaluate both the proposed SPA-MVSNet and the entire visual-inertial dense mapping system on several public datasets as well as our own dataset, demonstrating the system's impressive generalization capabilities and its ability to deliver high-quality 3D mesh reconstruction online. Our proposed dense mapping system achieves a 39.7% improvement in F-score over existing systems when evaluated on the challenging scenarios of the EuRoC dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Path-Constrained State Estimation for Rail Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12082v1)** | 2023-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Globally rising demand for transportation by rail is pushing existing infrastructure to its capacity limits, necessitating the development of accurate, robust, and high-frequency positioning systems to ensure safe and efficient train operation. As individual sensor modalities cannot satisfy the strict requirements of robustness and safety, a combination thereof is required. We propose a path-constrained sensor fusion framework to integrate various modalities while leveraging the unique characteristics of the railway network. To reflect the constrained motion of rail vehicles along their tracks, the state is modeled in 1D along the track geometry. We further leverage the limited action space of a train by employing a novel multi-hypothesis tracking to account for multiple possible trajectories a vehicle can take through the railway network. We demonstrate the reliability and accuracy of our fusion framework on multiple tram datasets recorded in the city of Zurich, utilizing Visual-Inertial Odometry for local motion estimation and a standard GNSS for global localization. We evaluate our results using ground truth localizations recorded with a RTK-GNSS, and compare our method to standard baselines. A Root Mean Square Error of 4.78 m and a track selectivity score of up to 94.9 % have been achieved.</p></details> |  |

To enable such comprehension, 3D scene graphs have emerged as a robust tool for representing the environment as a layered graph of concepts and their relationships. However, building these representations using monocular vision systems in real-time remains a difficult task that has not been explored in depth. This paper puts forth a real-time spatial perception system Mono-Hydra, combining a monocular camera and an IMU sensor setup, focusing on indoor scenarios. However, the proposed approach is adaptable to outdoor applications, offering flexibility in its potential uses. The system employs a suite of deep learning algorithms to derive depth and semantics. It uses a robocentric visual-inertial odometry (VIO) algorithm based on square-root information, thereby ensuring consistent visual odometry with an IMU and a monocular camera. This system achieves sub-20 cm error in real-time processing at 15 fps, enabling real-time 3D scene graph construction using a laptop GPU (NVIDIA 3080). This enhances decision-making efficiency and effectiveness in simple camera setups, augmenting robotic system agility.

In order to include range measurements in state estimation, the position of the UWB anchors must be known. This study proposes a multi-step initialization procedure to map multiple unknown anchors by an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), in a fully autonomous fashion. To address the limitations of initializing UWB anchors via a random trajectory, this paper uses the Geometric Dilution of Precision (GDOP) as a measure of optimality in anchor position estimation, to compute a set of optimal waypoints and synthesize a trajectory that minimizes the mapping uncertainty. After the initialization is complete, the range measurements from multiple anchors, including measurement biases, are tightly integrated into the VIO system. While in range of the initialized anchors, the VIO drift in position and heading is eliminated. The effectiveness of UVIO and our initialization procedure has been validated through a series of simulations and real-world experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stereo Event-based Visual-Inertial Odometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05086v4)** | 2023-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event-based cameras are new type vision sensors whose pixels work independently and respond asynchronously to brightness change with microsecond resolution, instead of providing standard intensity frames. Compared with traditional cameras, event-based cameras have low latency, no motion blur, and high dynamic range (HDR), which provide possibilities for robots to deal with some challenging scenes. We propose a visual-inertial odometry for stereo event-based cameras based on Error-State Kalman Filter (ESKF). The visual module updates the pose relies on the edge alignment of a semi-dense 3D map to a 2D image, and the IMU module updates pose by median integral. We evaluate our method on public datasets with general 6-DoF motion and compare the results against ground truth. We show that our proposed pipeline provides improved accuracy over the result of the state-of-the-art visual odometry for stereo event-based cameras, while running in real-time on a standard CPU (low-resolution cameras). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first published visual-inertial odometry for stereo event-based cameras.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Control of Smart Particle Swarms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.07195v2)** | 2023-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a method for the control of robot swarms using two subsets of robots: a larger group of simple, oblivious robots (which we call the workers) that is governed by simple local attraction forces, and a smaller group (the guides) with sufficient mission knowledge to create and displace a desired worker formation by operating on the local forces of the workers. The guides coordinate to shape the workers like smart particles by changing their interaction parameters. We study the approach with a large scale experiment in a physics based simulator with up to 5000 robots forming three different patterns. Our experiments reveal that the approach scales well with increasing robot numbers, and presents little pattern distortion. We evaluate the approach on a physical swarm of robots that use visual inertial odometry to compute their relative positions and obtain results that are comparable with simulation. This work lays the foundation for designing and coordinating configurable smart particles, with applications in smart materials and nanomedicine.</p></details> | 7 pages, 9 figures |
| **[HDVIO: Improving Localization and Disturbance Estimation with Hybrid Dynamics VIO](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11429v2)** | 2023-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual-inertial odometry (VIO) is the most common approach for estimating the state of autonomous micro aerial vehicles using only onboard sensors. Existing methods improve VIO performance by including a dynamics model in the estimation pipeline. However, such methods degrade in the presence of low-fidelity vehicle models and continuous external disturbances, such as wind. Our proposed method, HDVIO, overcomes these limitations by using a hybrid dynamics model that combines a point-mass vehicle model with a learning-based component that captures complex aerodynamic effects. HDVIO estimates the external force and the full robot state by leveraging the discrepancy between the actual motion and the predicted motion of the hybrid dynamics model. Our hybrid dynamics model uses a history of thrust and IMU measurements to predict the vehicle dynamics. To demonstrate the performance of our method, we present results on both public and novel drone dynamics datasets and show real-world experiments of a quadrotor flying in strong winds up to 25 km/h. The results show that our approach improves the motion and external force estimation compared to the state-of-the-art by up to 33% and 40%, respectively. Furthermore, differently from existing methods, we show that it is possible to predict the vehicle dynamics accurately while having no explicit knowledge of its full state.</p></details> |  |

However, it has been meeting challenges in vehicular scenarios due to limited dynamics and lack of stable features. In this paper, we propose Ground-VIO, which utilizes ground features and the specific camera-ground geometry to enhance monocular VIO performance in realistic road environments. In the method, the camera-ground geometry is modeled with vehicle-centered parameters and integrated into an optimization-based VIO framework. These parameters could be calibrated online and simultaneously improve the odometry accuracy by providing stable scale-awareness. Besides, a specially designed visual front-end is developed to stably extract and track ground features via the inverse perspective mapping (IPM) technique. Both simulation tests and real-world experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that our implementation could dramatically improve monocular VIO accuracy in vehicular scenarios, achieving comparable or even better performance than state-of-art stereo VIO solutions. The system could also be used for the auto-calibration of IPM which is widely used in vehicle perception. A toolkit for ground feature processing, together with the experimental datasets, would be made open-source (https://github.com/GREAT-WHU/gv_tools).</p></details> |  |

However, the direct method is sensitive to photometric changes, which can be compensated by introducing geometric information in the environment. In this paper, we propose a monocular direct sparse visual-inertial odometry, which exploits the planar regularities (PVI-DSO). Our system detects the planar regularities from the 3D mesh built on the estimated map points. To improve the pose estimation accuracy with the geometric information, a tightly coupled coplanar constraint expression is used to express photometric error in the direct method. Additionally, to improve the optimization efficiency, we elaborately derive the analytical Jacobian of the linearization form for the coplanar constraint. Finally, the inertial measurement error, coplanar point photometric error, non-coplanar photometric error, and prior error are added into the optimizer, which simultaneously improves the pose estimation accuracy and mesh itself. We verified the performance of the whole system on simulation and real-world datasets. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our system outperforms the state-of-the-art counterparts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Active Collaborative Localization in Heterogeneous Robot Teams](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18193v1)** | 2023-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and robust state estimation is critical for autonomous navigation of robot teams. This task is especially challenging for large groups of size, weight, and power (SWAP) constrained aerial robots operating in perceptually-degraded GPS-denied environments. We can, however, actively increase the amount of perceptual information available to such robots by augmenting them with a small number of more expensive, but less resource-constrained, agents. Specifically, the latter can serve as sources of perceptual information themselves. In this paper, we study the problem of optimally positioning (and potentially navigating) a small number of more capable agents to enhance the perceptual environment for their lightweight,inexpensive, teammates that only need to rely on cameras and IMUs. We propose a numerically robust, computationally efficient approach to solve this problem via nonlinear optimization. Our method outperforms the standard approach based on the greedy algorithm, while matching the accuracy of a heuristic evolutionary scheme for global optimization at a fraction of its running time. Ultimately, we validate our solution in both photorealistic simulations and real-world experiments. In these experiments, we use lidar-based autonomous ground vehicles as the more capable agents, and vision-based aerial robots as their SWAP-constrained teammates. Our method is able to reduce drift in visual-inertial odometry by as much as 90%, and it outperforms random positioning of lidar-equipped agents by a significant margin. Furthermore, our method can be generalized to different types of robot teams with heterogeneous perception capabilities. It has a wide range of applications, such as surveying and mapping challenging dynamic environments, and enabling resilience to large-scale perturbations that can be caused by earthquakes or storms.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in Robotics: Science and Systems (RSS) 2023</p></details> |

Leveraging the proposed lightweight Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) for depth inference and encoding, we provide the network with previously marginalized sparse features from VIO to increase the accuracy of initial depth prediction and generalization capability. The compact encoded depth maps are then updated jointly with navigation states in a sliding window estimator in order to provide the dense local scene geometry. We additionally propose a novel method to obtain the CVAE's Jacobian which is shown to be more than an order of magnitude faster than previous works, and we additionally leverage First-Estimate Jacobian (FEJ) to avoid recalculation. As opposed to previous works relying on completely dense residuals, we propose to only provide sparse measurements to update the depth code and show through careful experimentation that our choice of sparse measurements and FEJs can still significantly improve the estimated depth maps. Our full system also exhibits state-of-the-art pose estimation accuracy, and we show that it can run in real-time with single-thread execution while utilizing GPU acceleration only for the network and code Jacobian.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICRA ...</summary><p>ICRA 2021; Best Paper Award in Robot Vision (Finalist)</p></details> |

The paradigm of a centralized architecture is well established, with the robots (i.e. agents) running Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) onboard while communicating relevant data, such as e.g. Keyframes (KFs), to a central back-end (i.e. server), which then merges and optimizes the joint maps of the agents. While these frameworks have proven to be successful, their capability and performance are highly dependent on the choice of the VIO front-end, thus limiting their flexibility. In this work, we present COVINS-G, a generalized back-end building upon the COVINS framework, enabling the compatibility of the server-back-end with any arbitrary VIO front-end, including, for example, off-the-shelf cameras with odometry capabilities, such as the Realsense T265. The COVINS-G back-end deploys a multi-camera relative pose estimation algorithm for computing the loop-closure constraints allowing the system to work purely on 2D image data. In the experimental evaluation, we show on-par accuracy with state-of-the-art multi-session and collaborative SLAM systems, while demonstrating the flexibility and generality of our approach by employing different front-ends onboard collaborating agents within the same mission. The COVINS-G codebase along with a generalized front-end wrapper to allow any existing VIO front-end to be readily used in combination with the proposed collaborative back-end is open-sourced.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach for VIO with stereo cameras which integrates and calibrates the velocity-control based kinematic motion model of wheeled mobile robots online. Including such a motion model can help to improve the accuracy of VIO. Compared to several previous approaches proposed to integrate wheel odometer measurements for this purpose, our method does not require wheel encoders and can be applied when the robot motion can be modeled with velocity-control based kinematic motion model. We use radial basis function (RBF) kernels to compensate for the time delay and deviations between control commands and actual robot motion. The motion model is calibrated online by the VIO system and can be used as a forward model for motion control and planning. We evaluate our approach with data obtained in variously sized indoor environments, demonstrate improvements over a pure VIO method, and evaluate the prediction accuracy of the online calibrated model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L) 2022</p></details> |

Underwater robots operating in a challenging environment are required to know their pose at all times. All vision-based localization schemes are prone to failure due to poor visibility conditions, color loss, and lack of features. The proposed approach utilizes a model of the robot's kinematics together with proprioceptive sensors to maintain the pose estimate during visual-inertial odometry (VIO) failures. Furthermore, the trajectories from successful VIO and the ones from the model-driven odometry are integrated in a coherent set that maintains a consistent pose at all times. Health-monitoring tracks the VIO process ensuring timely switches between the two estimators. Finally, loop closure is implemented on the overall trajectory. The resulting framework is a robust estimator switching between model-based and visual-inertial odometry (SM/VIO). Experimental results from numerous deployments of the Aqua2 vehicle demonstrate the robustness of our approach over coral reefs and a shipwreck.</p></details> |  |

We find that attribution errors have the largest detrimental effect on performance.

Our approach performs global scale and shift alignment against sparse metric depth, followed by learning-based dense alignment. We evaluate on the TartanAir and VOID datasets, observing up to 30% reduction in inverse RMSE with dense scale alignment relative to performing just global alignment alone.

Since such applications are oftentimes not limited to predefined target domains and learning-based vision systems are known to generalize poorly to unseen environments, methods for continual adaptation during inference time are of significant interest. In this work, we introduce CoVIO for online continual learning of visual-inertial odometry. CoVIO effectively adapts to new domains while mitigating catastrophic forgetting by exploiting experience replay. In particular, we propose a novel sampling strategy to maximize image diversity in a fixed-size replay buffer that targets the limited storage capacity of embedded devices. We further provide an asynchronous version that decouples the odometry estimation from the network weight update step enabling continuous inference in real time. We extensively evaluate CoVIO on various real-world datasets demonstrating that it successfully adapts to new domains while outperforming previous methods.

In this paper, we propose partial IEKF (PIEKF), which only incorporates rotation-velocity state into the Lie group structure and apply it for Visual-Inertial-Wheel Odometry (VIWO) to improve positioning accuracy and consistency. Specifically, we derive the rotation-velocity measurement model, which combines wheel measurements with kinematic constraints. The model circumvents the wheel odometer's 3D integration and covariance propagation, which is essential for filter consistency. And a plane constraint is also introduced to enhance the position accuracy. A dynamic outlier detection method is adopted, leveraging the velocity state output. Through the simulation and real-world test, we validate the effectiveness of our approach, which outperforms the standard Multi-State Constraint Kalman Filter (MSCKF) based VIWO in consistency and accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by the mammal's visual system, which gazes at specific objects, we develop two novel constraints relating time-to-contact, acceleration, and distance that we call the $\tau$-constraint and $\Phi$-constraint. They allow an active (moving) camera to estimate depth efficiently and accurately while using only a small portion of the image. The constraints are applicable to range sensing, sensor fusion, and visual servoing. We successfully validate the proposed constraints with two experiments. The first applies both constraints in a trajectory estimation task with a monocular camera and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). Our methods achieve 30-70% less average trajectory error while running 25$\times$ and 6.2$\times$ faster than the popular Visual-Inertial Odometry methods VINS-Mono and ROVIO respectively. The second experiment demonstrates that when the constraints are used for feedback with efference copies the resulting closed loop system's eigenvalues are invariant to scaling of the applied control signal. We believe these results indicate the $\tau$ and $\Phi$ constraint's potential as the basis of robust and efficient algorithms for a multitude of robotic applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 24 figures, 1 table.

Conventional fusion methods use low-accuracy pseudorange based GNSS measurements ($>>5m$ errors) and can only yield a coarse registration to the global earth-centered-earth-fixed (ECEF) frame. In this paper, we leverage high-precision GNSS carrier-phase positioning and aid it with local visual-inertial odometry (VIO) tracking using an extended Kalman filter (EKF) framework that better resolves the integer ambiguity concerned with GNSS carrier-phase. %to achieve centimeter-level accuracy in the ECEF frame. We also propose an algorithm for accurate GNSS-antenna-to-IMU extrinsics calibration to accurately align VIO to the ECEF frame. Together, our system achieves robust global positioning demonstrated by real-world hardware experiments in severely occluded urban canyons, and outperforms the state-of-the-art RTKLIB by a significant margin in terms of integer ambiguity solution fix rate and positioning RMSE accuracy.</p></details> |  |

| **[KISS-SLAM: A Simple, Robust, and Accurate 3D LiDAR SLAM System With Enhanced Generalization Capabilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12660v1)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust and accurate localization and mapping of an environment using laser scanners, so-called LiDAR SLAM, is essential to many robotic applications. Early 3D LiDAR SLAM methods often exploited additional information from IMU or GNSS sensors to enhance localization accuracy and mitigate drift. Later, advanced systems further improved the estimation at the cost of a higher runtime and complexity. This paper explores the limits of what can be achieved with a LiDAR-only SLAM approach while following the "Keep It Small and Simple" (KISS) principle. By leveraging this minimalistic design principle, our system, KISS-SLAM, archives state-of-the-art performances in pose accuracy while requiring little to no parameter tuning for deployment across diverse environments, sensors, and motion profiles. We follow best practices in graph-based SLAM and build upon LiDAR odometry to compute the relative motion between scans and construct local maps of the environment. To correct drift, we match local maps and optimize the trajectory in a pose graph optimization step. The experimental results demonstrate that this design achieves competitive performance while reducing complexity and reliance on additional sensor modalities. By prioritizing simplicity, this work provides a new strong baseline for LiDAR-only SLAM and a high-performing starting point for future research. Further, our pipeline builds consistent maps that can be used directly for further downstream tasks like navigation. Our open-source system operates faster than the sensor frame rate in all presented datasets and is designed for real-world scenarios.</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[Leveraging Semantic Graphs for Efficient and Robust LiDAR SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11145v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and robust simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is crucial for autonomous mobile systems, typically achieved by leveraging the geometric features of the environment. Incorporating semantics provides a richer scene representation that not only enhances localization accuracy in SLAM but also enables advanced cognitive functionalities for downstream navigation and planning tasks. Existing point-wise semantic LiDAR SLAM methods often suffer from poor efficiency and generalization, making them less robust in diverse real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a semantic graph-enhanced SLAM framework, named SG-SLAM, which effectively leverages the geometric, semantic, and topological characteristics inherent in environmental structures. The semantic graph serves as a fundamental component that facilitates critical functionalities of SLAM, including robust relocalization during odometry failures, accurate loop closing, and semantic graph map construction. Our method employs a dual-threaded architecture, with one thread dedicated to online odometry and relocalization, while the other handles loop closure, pose graph optimization, and map update. This design enables our method to operate in real time and generate globally consistent semantic graph maps and point cloud maps. We extensively evaluate our method across the KITTI, MulRAN, and Apollo datasets, and the results demonstrate its superiority compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our method has been released at https://github.com/nubot-nudt/SG-SLAM.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

Current SLAM benchmarks overlook the significance of repeatability (precision), despite its importance in real-world deployments. To address this gap, we propose a task-driven approach to SLAM benchmarking, TaskSLAM-Bench. It employs precision as a key metric, accounts for SLAM's mapping capabilities, and has easy-to-meet implementation requirements. Simulated and real-world testing scenarios of SLAM methods provide insights into the navigation performance properties of modern visual and LiDAR SLAM solutions. The outcomes show that passive stereo SLAM operates at a level of precision comparable to LiDAR SLAM in typical indoor environments. TaskSLAM-Bench complements existing benchmarks and offers richer assessment of SLAM performance in navigation-focused scenarios. Publicly available code permits in-situ SLAM testing in custom environments with properly equipped robots.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 figures, 1 table.

However, the measurement process is demanding, requiring up to two days per hectare for data collection, significant data storage, as well as resource-heavy post-processing of 3D data. In this work, we present a real-time mapping and analysis system that enables online generation of forest inventories using mobile laser scanners that can be mounted e.g. on mobile robots. Given incrementally created and locally accurate submaps-data payloads-our approach extracts tree candidates using a custom, Voronoi-inspired clustering algorithm. Tree candidates are reconstructed using an adapted Hough algorithm, which enables robust modeling of the tree stem. Further, we explicitly incorporate the incremental nature of the data collection by consistently updating the database using a pose graph LiDAR SLAM system. This enables us to refine our estimates of the tree traits if an area is revisited later during a mission. We demonstrate competitive accuracy to TLS or manual measurements using laser scanners that we mounted on backpacks or mobile robots operating in conifer, broad-leaf and mixed forests. Our results achieve RMSE of 1.93 cm, a bias of 0.65 cm and a standard deviation of 1.81 cm (averaged across these sequences)-with no post-processing required after the mission is complete.</p></details> |  |
| **[Balancing Accuracy and Efficiency for Large-Scale SLAM: A Minimal Subset Approach for Scalable Loop Closures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01791v2)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Typical LiDAR SLAM architectures feature a front-end for odometry estimation and a back-end for refining and optimizing the trajectory and map, commonly through loop closures. However, loop closure detection in large-scale missions presents significant computational challenges due to the need to identify, verify, and process numerous candidate pairs for pose graph optimization. Keyframe sampling bridges the front-end and back-end by selecting frames for storing and processing during global optimization. This article proposes an online keyframe sampling approach that constructs the pose graph using the most impactful keyframes for loop closure. We introduce the Minimal Subset Approach (MSA), which optimizes two key objectives: redundancy minimization and information preservation, implemented within a sliding window framework. By operating in the feature space rather than 3-D space, MSA efficiently reduces redundant keyframes while retaining essential information. In sum, evaluations on diverse public datasets show that the proposed approach outperforms naive methods in reducing false positive rates in place recognition, while delivering superior ATE and RPE in metric localization, without the need for manual parameter tuning. Additionally, MSA demonstrates efficiency and scalability by reducing memory usage and computational overhead during loop closure detection and pose graph optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 Figures, 2 Tables.

| **[Anti-Degeneracy Scheme for Lidar SLAM based on Particle Filter in Geometry Feature-Less Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11486v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) based on particle filtering has been extensively employed in indoor scenarios due to its high efficiency. However, in geometry feature-less scenes, the accuracy is severely reduced due to lack of constraints. In this article, we propose an anti-degeneracy system based on deep learning. Firstly, we design a scale-invariant linear mapping to convert coordinates in continuous space into discrete indexes, in which a data augmentation method based on Gaussian model is proposed to ensure the model performance by effectively mitigating the impact of changes in the number of particles on the feature distribution. Secondly, we develop a degeneracy detection model using residual neural networks (ResNet) and transformer which is able to identify degeneracy by scrutinizing the distribution of the particle population. Thirdly, an adaptive anti-degeneracy strategy is designed, which first performs fusion and perturbation on the resample process to provide rich and accurate initial values for the pose optimization, and use a hierarchical pose optimization combining coarse and fine matching, which is able to adaptively adjust the optimization frequency and the sensor trustworthiness according to the degree of degeneracy, in order to enhance the ability of searching the global optimal pose. Finally, we demonstrate the optimality of the model, as well as the improvement of the image matrix method and GPU on the computation time through ablation experiments, and verify the performance of the anti-degeneracy system in different scenarios through simulation experiments and real experiments.

| **[SiLVR: Scalable Lidar-Visual Radiance Field Reconstruction with Uncertainty Quantification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02657v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a neural radiance field (NeRF) based large-scale reconstruction system that fuses lidar and vision data to generate high-quality reconstructions that are geometrically accurate and capture photorealistic texture. Our system adopts the state-of-the-art NeRF representation to additionally incorporate lidar. Adding lidar data adds strong geometric constraints on the depth and surface normals, which is particularly useful when modelling uniform texture surfaces which contain ambiguous visual reconstruction cues. Furthermore, we estimate the epistemic uncertainty of the reconstruction as the spatial variance of each point location in the radiance field given the sensor observations from camera and lidar. This enables the identification of areas that are reliably reconstructed by each sensor modality, allowing the map to be filtered according to the estimated uncertainty. Our system can also exploit the trajectory produced by a real-time pose-graph lidar SLAM system during online mapping to bootstrap a (post-processed) Structure-from-Motion (SfM) reconstruction procedure reducing SfM training time by up to 70%. It also helps to properly constrain the overall metric scale which is essential for the lidar depth loss. The globally-consistent trajectory can then be divided into submaps using Spectral Clustering to group sets of co-visible images together. This submapping approach is more suitable for visual reconstruction than distance-based partitioning. Each submap is filtered according to point-wise uncertainty estimates and merged to obtain the final large-scale 3D reconstruction. We demonstrate the reconstruction system using a multi-camera, lidar sensor suite in experiments involving both robot-mounted and handheld scanning. Our test datasets cover a total area of more than 20,000 square metres, including multiple university buildings and an aerial survey of a multi-storey.</p></details> | <details><summary>webpa...</summary><p>webpage: https://dynamic.robots.ox.ac.uk/projects/silvr/</p></details> |
| **[LiDAR Loop Closure Detection using Semantic Graphs with Graph Attention Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19382v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a novel loop closure detection algorithm that uses graph attention neural networks to encode semantic graphs to perform place recognition and then use semantic registration to estimate the 6 DoF relative pose constraint. Our place recognition algorithm has two key modules, namely, a semantic graph encoder module and a graph comparison module. The semantic graph encoder employs graph attention networks to efficiently encode spatial, semantic and geometric information from the semantic graph of the input point cloud. We then use self-attention mechanism in both node-embedding and graph-embedding steps to create distinctive graph vectors. The graph vectors of the current scan and a keyframe scan are then compared in the graph comparison module to identify a possible loop closure. Specifically, employing the difference of the two graph vectors showed a significant improvement in performance, as shown in ablation studies. Lastly, we implemented a semantic registration algorithm that takes in loop closure candidate scans and estimates the relative 6 DoF pose constraint for the LiDAR SLAM system. Extensive evaluation on public datasets shows that our model is more accurate and robust, achieving 13% improvement in maximum F1 score on the SemanticKITTI dataset, when compared to the baseline semantic graph algorithm. For the benefit of the community, we open-source the complete implementation of our proposed algorithm and custom implementation of semantic registration at https://github.com/crepuscularlight/SemanticLoopClosure</p></details> |  |
| **[Lifelong 3D Mapping Framework for Hand-held & Robot-mounted LiDAR Mapping Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18110v1)** | 2025-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a lifelong 3D mapping framework that is modular, cloud-native by design and more importantly, works for both hand-held and robot-mounted 3D LiDAR mapping systems. Our proposed framework comprises of dynamic point removal, multi-session map alignment, map change detection and map version control. First, our sensor-setup agnostic dynamic point removal algorithm works seamlessly with both hand-held and robot-mounted setups to produce clean static 3D maps. Second, the multi-session map alignment aligns these clean static maps automatically, without manual parameter fine-tuning, into a single reference frame, using a two stage approach based on feature descriptor matching and fine registration. Third, our novel map change detection identifies positive and negative changes between two aligned maps. Finally, the map version control maintains a single base map that represents the current state of the environment, and stores the detected positive and negative changes, and boundary information. Our unique map version control system can reconstruct any of the previous clean session maps and allows users to query changes between any two random mapping sessions, all without storing any input raw session maps, making it very unique. Extensive experiments are performed using hand-held commercial LiDAR mapping devices and open-source robot-mounted LiDAR SLAM algorithms to evaluate each module and the whole 3D lifelong mapping framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unified Few-shot Crack Segmentation and its Precise 3D Automatic Measurement in Concrete Structures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09203v1)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual-Spatial Systems has become increasingly essential in concrete crack inspection. However, existing methods often lacks adaptability to diverse scenarios, exhibits limited robustness in image-based approaches, and struggles with curved or complex geometries. To address these limitations, an innovative framework for two-dimensional (2D) crack detection, three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction, and 3D automatic crack measurement was proposed by integrating computer vision technologies and multi-modal Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) in this study. Firstly, building on a base DeepLabv3+ segmentation model, and incorporating specific refinements utilizing foundation model Segment Anything Model (SAM), we developed a crack segmentation method with strong generalization across unfamiliar scenarios, enabling the generation of precise 2D crack masks. To enhance the accuracy and robustness of 3D reconstruction, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) point clouds were utilized together with image data and segmentation masks. By leveraging both image- and LiDAR-SLAM, we developed a multi-frame and multi-modal fusion framework that produces dense, colorized point clouds, effectively capturing crack semantics at a 3D real-world scale. Furthermore, the crack geometric attributions were measured automatically and directly within 3D dense point cloud space, surpassing the limitations of conventional 2D image-based measurements. This advancement makes the method suitable for structural components with curved and complex 3D geometries. Experimental results across various concrete structures highlight the significant improvements and unique advantages of the proposed method, demonstrating its effectiveness, accuracy, and robustness in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

However, even in modern SLAM solutions, ICP can degrade and become unreliable in geometrically ill-conditioned environments. Current solutions primarily focus on utilizing additional sources of information, such as external odometry, to either replace the degenerate directions of the optimization solution or add additional constraints in a sensor-fusion setup afterward. In response, this work investigates and compares new and existing degeneracy mitigation methods for robust LiDAR-based localization and analyzes the efficacy of these approaches in degenerate environments for the first time in the literature at this scale. Specifically, this work investigates i) the effect of using active or passive degeneracy mitigation methods for the problem of ill-conditioned ICP in LiDAR degenerate environments, ii) the evaluation of TSVD, inequality constraints, and linear/non-linear Tikhonov regularization for the application of degenerate point cloud registration for the first time. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis for least-squares minimization step of the ICP problem is carried out to better understand how each method affects the optimization and what to expect from each method. The results of the analysis are validated through multiple real-world robotic field and simulated experiments. The analysis demonstrates that active optimization degeneracy mitigation is necessary and advantageous in the absence of reliable external estimate assistance for LiDAR-SLAM, and soft-constrained methods can provide better results in complex ill-conditioned scenarios with heuristic fine-tuned parameters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Field Robotics</p></details> |

However, off-the-shelf LiDAR-based SLAM methods suffer from significant pose estimation drifts, particularly components relevant to the vertical direction, when passing to uneven terrains. This deficiency typically leads to a conspicuously distorted global map. In this article, a LiDAR-based SLAM method is presented to improve the accuracy of pose estimations for ground vehicles in rough terrains, which is termed Rotation-Optimized LiDAR-Only (ROLO) SLAM. The method exploits a forward location prediction to coarsely eliminate the location difference of consecutive scans, thereby enabling separate and accurate determination of the location and orientation at the front-end. Furthermore, we adopt a parallel-capable spatial voxelization for correspondence-matching. We develop a spherical alignment-guided rotation registration within each voxel to estimate the rotation of vehicle. By incorporating geometric alignment, we introduce the motion constraint into the optimization formulation to enhance the rapid and effective estimation of LiDAR's translation. Subsequently, we extract several keyframes to construct the submap and exploit an alignment from the current scan to the submap for precise pose estimation. Meanwhile, a global-scale factor graph is established to aid in the reduction of cumulative errors. In various scenes, diverse experiments have been conducted to evaluate our method. The results demonstrate that ROLO-SLAM excels in pose estimation of ground vehicles and outperforms existing state-of-the-art LiDAR SLAM frameworks.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This article has been accepted by Journal of Field Robotics</p></details> |

One key contribution of this work to 3D LiDAR SLAM and localization is a fierce defense of view-based maps (pose graphs with time-stamped sensor readings) as the fundamental representation of maps. As will be shown, they allow for the greatest flexibility, enabling the posterior generation of arbitrary metric maps optimized for particular tasks, e.g. obstacle avoidance, real-time localization. Moreover, this work introduces a new framework in which mapping pipelines can be defined without coding, defining the connections of a network of reusable blocks much like deep-learning networks are designed by connecting layers of standardized elements. We also introduce tightly-coupled estimation of linear and angular velocity vectors within the Iterative Closest Point (ICP)-like optimizer, leading to superior robustness against aggressive motion profiles without the need for an IMU. Extensive experimental validation reveals that the proposal compares well to, or improves, former state-of-the-art (SOTA) LiDAR odometry systems, while also successfully mapping some hard sequences where others diverge. A proposed self-adaptive configuration has been used, without parameter changes, for all 3D LiDAR datasets with sensors between 16 and 128 rings, and has been extensively tested on 83 sequences over more than 250~km of automotive, hand-held, airborne, and quadruped LiDAR datasets, both indoors and outdoors. The system flexibility is demonstrated with additional configurations for 2D LiDARs and for building 3D NDT-like maps.

| **[Selective Kalman Filter: When and How to Fuse Multi-Sensor Information to Overcome Degeneracy in SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17235v1)** | 2024-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Research trends in SLAM systems are now focusing more on multi-sensor fusion to handle challenging and degenerative environments. However, most existing multi-sensor fusion SLAM methods mainly use all of the data from a range of sensors, a strategy we refer to as the all-in method. This method, while merging the benefits of different sensors, also brings in their weaknesses, lowering the robustness and accuracy and leading to high computational demands. To address this, we propose a new fusion approach -- Selective Kalman Filter -- to carefully choose and fuse information from multiple sensors (using LiDAR and visual observations as examples in this paper). For deciding when to fuse data, we implement degeneracy detection in LiDAR SLAM, incorporating visual measurements only when LiDAR SLAM exhibits degeneracy. Regarding degeneracy detection, we propose an elegant yet straightforward approach to determine the degeneracy of LiDAR SLAM and to identify the specific degenerative direction. This method fully considers the coupled relationship between rotational and translational constraints. In terms of how to fuse data, we use visual measurements only to update the specific degenerative states. As a result, our proposed method improves upon the all-in method by greatly enhancing real-time performance due to less processing visual data, and it introduces fewer errors from visual measurements. Experiments demonstrate that our method for degeneracy detection and fusion, in addressing degeneracy issues, exhibits higher precision and robustness compared to other state-of-the-art methods, and offers enhanced real-time performance relative to the all-in method. The code is openly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Real-time Degeneracy Sensing and Compensation Method for Enhanced LiDAR SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07513v1)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR is widely used in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and autonomous driving. The LiDAR odometry is of great importance in multi-sensor fusion. However, in some unstructured environments, the point cloud registration cannot constrain the poses of the LiDAR due to its sparse geometric features, which leads to the degeneracy of multi-sensor fusion accuracy. To address this problem, we propose a novel real-time approach to sense and compensate for the degeneracy of LiDAR. Firstly, this paper introduces the degeneracy factor with clear meaning, which can measure the degeneracy of LiDAR. Then, the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) clustering method adaptively perceives the degeneracy with better environmental generalization. Finally, the degeneracy perception results are utilized to fuse LiDAR and IMU, thus effectively resisting degeneracy effects. Experiments on our dataset show the method's high accuracy and robustness and validate our algorithm's adaptability to different environments and LiDAR scanning modalities.</p></details> | 13 pages |
| **[LiDAR SLAMMOT based on Confidence-guided Data Association](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01041v1)** | 2024-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the field of autonomous driving or robotics, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and multi-object tracking (MOT) are two fundamental problems and are generally applied separately. Solutions to SLAM and MOT usually rely on certain assumptions, such as the static environment assumption for SLAM and the accurate ego-vehicle pose assumption for MOT. But in complex dynamic environments, it is difficult or even impossible to meet these assumptions. Therefore, the SLAMMOT, i.e., simultaneous localization, mapping, and moving object tracking, integrated system of SLAM and object tracking, has emerged for autonomous vehicles in dynamic environments. However, many conventional SLAMMOT solutions directly perform data association on the predictions and detections for object tracking, but ignore their quality. In practice, inaccurate predictions caused by continuous multi-frame missed detections in temporary occlusion scenarios, may degrade the performance of tracking, thereby affecting SLAMMOT. To address this challenge, this paper presents a LiDAR SLAMMOT based on confidence-guided data association (Conf SLAMMOT) method, which tightly couples the LiDAR SLAM and the confidence-guided data association based multi-object tracking into a graph optimization backend for estimating the state of the ego-vehicle and objects simultaneously. The confidence of prediction and detection are applied in the factor graph-based multi-object tracking for its data association, which not only avoids the performance degradation caused by incorrect initial assignments in some filter-based methods but also handles issues such as continuous missed detection in tracking while also improving the overall performance of SLAMMOT. Various comparative experiments demonstrate the superior advantages of Conf SLAMMOT, especially in scenes with some missed detections.</p></details> |  |
| **[SGLC: Semantic Graph-Guided Coarse-Fine-Refine Full Loop Closing for LiDAR SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08106v2)** | 2024-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Loop closing is a crucial component in SLAM that helps eliminate accumulated errors through two main steps: loop detection and loop pose correction. The first step determines whether loop closing should be performed, while the second estimates the 6-DoF pose to correct odometry drift. Current methods mostly focus on developing robust descriptors for loop closure detection, often neglecting loop pose estimation. A few methods that do include pose estimation either suffer from low accuracy or incur high computational costs. To tackle this problem, we introduce SGLC, a real-time semantic graph-guided full loop closing method, with robust loop closure detection and 6-DoF pose estimation capabilities. SGLC takes into account the distinct characteristics of foreground and background points. For foreground instances, it builds a semantic graph that not only abstracts point cloud representation for fast descriptor generation and matching but also guides the subsequent loop verification and initial pose estimation. Background points, meanwhile, are exploited to provide more geometric features for scan-wise descriptor construction and stable planar information for further pose refinement. Loop pose estimation employs a \mbox{coarse-fine-refine} registration scheme that considers the alignment of both instance points and background points, offering high efficiency and accuracy. Extensive experiments on multiple publicly available datasets demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we integrate SGLC into a SLAM system, eliminating accumulated errors and improving overall SLAM performance. The implementation of SGLC will be released at https://github.com/nubot-nudt/SGLC.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

To address these issues, this paper presents DFLIOM with several key innovations. Unlike previous methods that rely on handcrafted heuristics and hand-tuned parameters for feature extraction, we propose a learning-based approach that select points relevant to LiDAR SLAM pointcloud registration. Furthermore, we extend our prior work DLIOM with the learned feature extractor and observe our method enables similar or even better localization performance using only about 20\% of the points in the dense point clouds. We demonstrate that DFLIOM performs well on multiple public benchmarks, achieving a 2.4\% decrease in localization error and 57.5\% decrease in memory usage compared to state-of-the-art methods (DLIOM). Although extracting features with the proposed network requires extra time, it is offset by the faster processing time downstream, thus maintaining real-time performance using 20Hz LiDAR on our hardware setup. The effectiveness of our learning-based feature extraction module is further demonstrated through comparison with several handcrafted feature extractors.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |

Current SLAM systems can achieve centimeter-level accuracy within a short period. However, there are still several challenges when dealing with largescale mapping tasks including significant storage requirements and difficulty of reusing the constructed maps. To address this, we first design an elastic and lightweight map representation called CELLmap, composed of several CELLs, each representing the local map at the corresponding location. Then, we design a general backend including CELL-based bidirectional registration module and loop closure detection module to improve global map consistency. Our experiments have demonstrated that CELLmap can represent the precise geometric structure of large-scale maps of KITTI dataset using only about 60 MB. Additionally, our general backend achieves up to a 26.88% improvement over various LiDAR odometry methods.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |

In this paper, we propose a SLAM system for building globally consistent maps, called PIN-SLAM, that is based on an elastic and compact point-based implicit neural map representation. Taking range measurements as input, our approach alternates between incremental learning of the local implicit signed distance field and the pose estimation given the current local map using a correspondence-free, point-to-implicit model registration. Our implicit map is based on sparse optimizable neural points, which are inherently elastic and deformable with the global pose adjustment when closing a loop. Loops are also detected using the neural point features. Extensive experiments validate that PIN-SLAM is robust to various environments and versatile to different range sensors such as LiDAR and RGB-D cameras. PIN-SLAM achieves pose estimation accuracy better or on par with the state-of-the-art LiDAR odometry or SLAM systems and outperforms the recent neural implicit SLAM approaches while maintaining a more consistent, and highly compact implicit map that can be reconstructed as accurate and complete meshes. Finally, thanks to the voxel hashing for efficient neural points indexing and the fast implicit map-based registration without closest point association, PIN-SLAM can run at the sensor frame rate on a moderate GPU. Codes will be available at: https://github.com/PRBonn/PIN_SLAM.</p></details> | 20 pages |

However, the utilization of 2D LiDAR in Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) frequently encounters challenges related to motion degeneracy, particularly in geometrically similar environments. To address this problem, this paper proposes a robust, accurate, and multi-sensor-fused 2D LiDAR SLAM system specifically designed for indoor mobile robots. To commence, the original LiDAR data undergoes meticulous processing through point and line extraction. Leveraging the distinctive characteristics of indoor environments, line-line constraints are established to complement other sensor data effectively, thereby augmenting the overall robustness and precision of the system. Concurrently, a tightly-coupled front-end is created, integrating data from the 2D LiDAR, IMU, and wheel odometry, thus enabling real-time state estimation. Building upon this solid foundation, a novel global feature point matching-based loop closure detection algorithm is proposed. This algorithm proves highly effective in mitigating front-end accumulated errors and ultimately constructs a globally consistent map. The experimental results indicate that our system fully meets real-time requirements. When compared to Cartographer, our system not only exhibits lower trajectory errors but also demonstrates stronger robustness, particularly in degeneracy problem.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by Measurement Science and Technology: https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6501/ad3ea3/meta</p></details> |

Existing implicit mapping methods for LiDAR show promising results in large-scale reconstruction, but either require groundtruth poses or run slower than real-time. In contrast, LONER uses LiDAR data to train an MLP to estimate a dense map in real-time, while simultaneously estimating the trajectory of the sensor. To achieve real-time performance, this paper proposes a novel information-theoretic loss function that accounts for the fact that different regions of the map may be learned to varying degrees throughout online training. The proposed method is evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively on two open-source datasets. This evaluation illustrates that the proposed loss function converges faster and leads to more accurate geometry reconstruction than other loss functions used in depth-supervised neural implicit frameworks. Finally, this paper shows that LONER estimates trajectories competitively with state-of-the-art LiDAR SLAM methods, while also producing dense maps competitive with existing real-time implicit mapping methods that use groundtruth poses.</p></details> | <details><summary>First...</summary><p>First two authors equally contributed.

NDT-Map-Code can be directly extracted from the NDT map without the need for a dense point cloud, resulting in excellent scalability and low maintenance cost. The NDT representation is leveraged to identify representative patterns, which are further encoded according to their spatial location (bearing, range, and height).

It then grew to implement Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) on various robots and mobile platforms. As each application brings its own set of contraints on sensors, processing capabilities and locomotion, it raises the question of which SLAM approach is the most appropriate to use in terms of cost, accuracy, computation power and ease of integration. Since most of SLAM approaches are either visual or lidar-based, comparison is difficult. Therefore, we decided to extend RTAB-Map to support both visual and lidar SLAM, providing in one package a tool allowing users to implement and compare a variety of 3D and 2D solutions for a wide range of applications with different robots and sensors. This paper presents this extended version of RTAB-Map and its use in comparing, both quantitatively and qualitatively, a large selection of popular real-world datasets (e.g., KITTI, EuRoC, TUM RGB-D, MIT Stata Center on PR2 robot), outlining strengths and limitations of visual and lidar SLAM configurations from a practical perspective for autonomous navigation applications.</p></details> | 40 pages, 19 figures |

| **[Quatro++: Robust Global Registration Exploiting Ground Segmentation for Loop Closing in LiDAR SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00928v2)** | 2024-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Global registration is a fundamental task that estimates the relative pose between two viewpoints of 3D point clouds. However, there are two issues that degrade the performance of global registration in LiDAR SLAM: one is the sparsity issue and the other is degeneracy. The sparsity issue is caused by the sparse characteristics of the 3D point cloud measurements in a mechanically spinning LiDAR sensor. The degeneracy issue sometimes occurs because the outlier-rejection methods reject too many correspondences, leaving less than three inliers. These two issues have become more severe as the pose discrepancy between the two viewpoints of 3D point clouds becomes greater. To tackle these problems, we propose a robust global registration framework, called \textit{Quatro++}. Extending our previous work that solely focused on the global registration itself, we address the robust global registration in terms of the loop closing in LiDAR SLAM. To this end, ground segmentation is exploited to achieve robust global registration. Through the experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed method shows a higher success rate than the state-of-the-art global registration methods, overcoming the sparsity and degeneracy issues. In addition, we show that ground segmentation significantly helps to increase the success rate for the ground vehicles. Finally, we apply our proposed method to the loop closing module in LiDAR SLAM and confirm that the quality of the loop constraints is improved, showing more precise mapping results. Therefore, the experimental evidence corroborated the suitability of our method as an initial alignment in the loop closing. Our code is available at https://quatro-plusplus.github.io.</p></details> | 26 pages, 23 figures |
| **[Versatile LiDAR-Inertial Odometry With SE (2) Constraints for Ground Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01584v1)** | 2023-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR SLAM has become one of the major localization systems for ground vehicles since LiDAR Odometry And Mapping (LOAM). Many extension works on LOAM mainly leverage one specific constraint to improve the performance, e.g., information from on-board sensors such as loop closure and inertial state; prior conditions such as ground level and motion dynamics. In many robotic applications, these conditions are often known partially, hence a SLAM system can be a comprehensive problem due to the existence of numerous constraints. Therefore, we can achieve a better SLAM result by fusing them properly. In this paper, we propose a hybrid LiDAR-inertial SLAM framework that leverages both the on-board perception system and prior information such as motion dynamics to improve localization performance. In particular, we consider the case for ground vehicles, which are commonly used for autonomous driving and warehouse logistics. We present a computationally efficient LiDAR-inertial odometry method that directly parameterizes ground vehicle poses on SE(2). The out-of-SE(2) motion perturbations are not neglected but incorporated into an integrated noise term of a novel SE(2)-constraints model. For odometric measurement processing, we propose a versatile, tightly coupled LiDAR-inertial odometry to achieve better pose estimation than traditional LiDAR odometry. Thorough experiments are performed to evaluate our proposed method's performance in different scenarios, including localization for both indoor and outdoor environments. The proposed method achieves superior performance in accuracy and robustness.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches either rely on dense point clouds to achieve high localization accuracy or use generalized descriptors to reduce map size. Unfortunately, these two aspects seem to conflict with each other. To address this limitation, we propose a unified architecture, DeepPointMap, achieving excellent preference on both aspects. We utilize neural network to extract highly representative and sparse neural descriptors from point clouds, enabling memory-efficient map representation and accurate multi-scale localization tasks (e.g., odometry and loop-closure). Moreover, we showcase the versatility of our framework by extending it to more challenging multi-agent collaborative SLAM.

Meanwhile, the ground-truth of the vehicle was obtained using a centimeter-level high-accuracy GNSS-RTK/INS navigation system. All sensors are well-calibrated and temporally synchronized at the hardware level, with recording data simultaneously.

This article begins by formulating loop closing and relocalization within a unified framework. Then, we propose a novel multi-head network LCR-Net to tackle both tasks effectively. It exploits novel feature extraction and pose-aware attention mechanism to precisely estimate similarities and 6-DoF poses between pairs of LiDAR scans. In the end, we integrate our LCR-Net into a SLAM system and achieve robust and accurate online LiDAR SLAM in outdoor driving environments. We thoroughly evaluate our LCR-Net through three setups derived from loop closing and relocalization, including candidate retrieval, closed-loop point cloud registration, and continuous relocalization using multiple datasets. The results demonstrate that LCR-Net excels in all three tasks, surpassing the state-of-the-art methods and exhibiting a remarkable generalization ability. Notably, our LCR-Net outperforms baseline methods without using a time-consuming robust pose estimator, rendering it suitable for online SLAM applications. To our best knowledge, the integration of LCR-Net yields the first LiDAR SLAM with the capability of deep loop closing and relocalization.

This new capability is beneficial for perceptions in various use cases, but it is challenging for resource-constrained mobile devices to use the perceptions in real-time because of their high computational complexity. In this context, edge computing can be used to enable LiDAR online perceptions, but offloading the perceptions on the edge server requires a low-latency, lightweight, and efficient compression due to the large volume of LiDAR point clouds data. This paper presents FLiCR, a fast and lightweight LiDAR point cloud compression method for enabling edge-assisted online perceptions. FLiCR is based on range images (RI) as an intermediate representation (IR), and dictionary coding for compressing RIs. FLiCR achieves its benefits by leveraging lossy RIs, and we show the efficiency of bytestream compression is largely improved with quantization and subsampling. In addition, we identify the limitation of current quality metrics for presenting the entropy of a point cloud, and introduce a new metric that reflects both point-wise and entropy-wise qualities for lossy IRs. The evaluation results show FLiCR is more suitable for edge-assisted real-time perceptions than the existing LiDAR compressions, and we demonstrate the effectiveness of our compression and metric with the evaluations on 3D object detection and LiDAR SLAM.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 11 figures, conference paper</p></details> |

But the LiDAR-SLAM could be disturbed by current scene moving objects, resulting in drift errors and even loop-closure failure. Thus, the ability to detect and segment moving objects is essential for high-precision positioning and building a consistent map. In this paper, we address the problem of moving object segmentation from 3D LiDAR scans to improve the odometry and loop-closure accuracy of SLAM. We propose a novel 3D Sequential Moving-Object-Segmentation (3D-SeqMOS) method that can accurately segment the scene into moving and static objects, such as moving and static cars. Different from the existing projected-image method, we process the raw 3D point cloud and build a 3D convolution neural network for MOS task. In addition, to make full use of the spatio-temporal information of point cloud, we propose a point cloud residual mechanism using the spatial features of current scan and the temporal features of previous residual scans. Besides, we build a complete SLAM framework to verify the effectiveness and accuracy of 3D-SeqMOS. Experiments on SemanticKITTI dataset show that our proposed 3D-SeqMOS method can effectively detect moving objects and improve the accuracy of LiDAR odometry and loop-closure detection. The test results show our 3D-SeqMOS outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 12.4%. We extend the proposed method to the SemanticKITTI: Moving Object Segmentation competition and achieve the 2nd in the leaderboard, showing its effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

However, it faces many challenges in real-world scenarios, such as the prior information about the environment being absent and poor communication among the team members. This work presents DCL-SLAM, a fully distributed collaborative LiDAR SLAM framework intended for the robotic swarm to simultaneously co-localize in an unknown environment with minimal information exchange. Based on ad-hoc wireless peer-to-peer communication (limited bandwidth and communication range), DCL-SLAM adopts the lightweight LiDAR-Iris descriptor for place recognition and does not require full connectivity among teams. DCL-SLAM includes three main parts: a replaceable single-robot front-end that produces LiDAR odometry results; a distributed loop closure module that detects inter-robot loop closures with keyframes; and a distributed back-end module that adapts distributed pose graph optimizer combined with a pairwise consistent measurement set maximization algorithm to reject spurious inter-robot loop closures. We integrate our proposed framework with diverse open-source LiDAR odometry methods to show its versatility. The proposed system is extensively evaluated on benchmarking datasets and field experiments over various scales and environments. Experimental result shows that DCL-SLAM achieves higher accuracy and lower communication bandwidth than other state-of-art multi-robot SLAM systems.

Current marker-based VSLAM approaches mainly utilize markers for improving feature detections in low-feature environments and/or for incorporating loop closure constraints, generating only low-level geometric maps of the environment prone to inaccuracies in complex environments. To bridge this gap, this paper presents a VSLAM approach utilizing a monocular camera along with fiducial markers to generate hierarchical representations of the environment while improving the camera pose estimate. The proposed approach detects semantic entities from the surroundings, including walls, corridors, and rooms encoded within markers, and appropriately adds topological constraints among them. Experimental results on a real-world dataset collected with a robot demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms a traditional marker-based VSLAM baseline in terms of accuracy, given the addition of new constraints while creating enhanced map representations. Furthermore, it shows satisfactory results when comparing the reconstructed map quality to the one reconstructed using a LiDAR SLAM approach.</p></details> | 7 pages, 6 figures |

Dense maps are essential for robotic applications, such as map-based navigation. Due to the low memory cost, mesh has become an attractive dense model for mapping in recent years. However, existing methods usually produce mesh maps by using an offline post-processing step to generate mesh maps. This two-step pipeline does not allow these methods to use the built mesh maps online and to enable localization and meshing to benefit each other. To solve this problem, we propose the first CPU-only real-time LiDAR SLAM system that can simultaneously build a mesh map and perform localization against the mesh map. A novel and direct meshing strategy with Gaussian process reconstruction realizes the fast building, registration, and updating of mesh maps. We perform experiments on several public datasets. The results show that our SLAM system can run at around $40$Hz. The localization and meshing accuracy also outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, including the TSDF map and Poisson reconstruction.

In this work, we have developed an improved LiDAR-inertial localization and mapping system for unmanned ground vehicles, which is appropriate for versatile search and rescue applications. Compared with existing LiDAR-based localization and mapping systems such as LOAM, we have two major contributions: the first is the improvement of the robustness of particle swarm filter-based LiDAR SLAM, while the second is the loop closure methods developed for global optimization to improve the localization accuracy of the whole system. We demonstrate by experiments that the accuracy and robustness of the LiDAR SLAM system are both improved. Finally, we have done systematic experimental tests at the Hong Kong science park as well as other indoor or outdoor real complicated testing circumstances, which demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach. It is demonstrated that our system has high accuracy, robustness, as well as efficiency. Our system is of great importance to the localization and mapping of the unmanned ground vehicle in an unknown environment.</p></details> | ICCA 2022 (Oral) |
| **[An Integrated LiDAR-SLAM System for Complex Environment with Noisy Point Clouds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05705v1)** | 2022-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The current LiDAR SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) system suffers greatly from low accuracy and limited robustness when faced with complicated circumstances. From our experiments, we find that current LiDAR SLAM systems have limited performance when the noise level in the obtained point clouds is large. Therefore, in this work, we propose a general framework to tackle the problem of denoising and loop closure for LiDAR SLAM in complex environments with many noises and outliers caused by reflective materials. Current approaches for point clouds denoising are mainly designed for small-scale point clouds and can not be extended to large-scale point clouds scenes. In this work, we firstly proposed a lightweight network for large-scale point clouds denoising. Subsequently, we have also designed an efficient loop closure network for place recognition in global optimization to improve the localization accuracy of the whole system. Finally, we have demonstrated by extensive experiments and benchmark studies that our method can have a significant boost on the localization accuracy of the LiDAR SLAM system when faced with noisy point clouds, with a marginal increase in computational cost.</p></details> | IROS 2022 |

The solutions to these problems are generally based on their respective assumptions, \ie{the static world assumption for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and the accurate ego-pose assumption for object tracking}. However, these assumptions are challenging to hold in dynamic road scenarios, where SLAM and object tracking become closely correlated. Therefore, we propose DL-SLOT, a dynamic LiDAR SLAM and object tracking method, to simultaneously address these two coupled problems. This method integrates the state estimations of both the autonomous vehicle and the stationary and dynamic objects in the environment into a unified optimization framework. First, we used object detection to identify all points belonging to potentially dynamic objects. Subsequently, a LiDAR odometry was conducted using the filtered point cloud. Simultaneously, we proposed a sliding window-based object association method that accurately associates objects according to the historical trajectories of tracked objects. The ego-states and those of the stationary and dynamic objects are integrated into the sliding window-based collaborative graph optimization. The stationary objects are subsequently restored from the potentially dynamic object set. Finally, a global pose-graph is implemented to eliminate the accumulated error. Experiments on KITTI datasets demonstrate that our method achieves better accuracy than SLAM and object tracking baseline methods. This confirms that solving SLAM and object tracking simultaneously is mutually advantageous, dramatically improving the robustness and accuracy of SLAM and object tracking in dynamic road scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 10 figures, this work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[BoW3D: Bag of Words for Real-Time Loop Closing in 3D LiDAR SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07473v2)** | 2022-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Loop closing is a fundamental part of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) for autonomous mobile systems. In the field of visual SLAM, bag of words (BoW) has achieved great success in loop closure. The BoW features for loop searching can also be used in the subsequent 6-DoF loop correction. However, for 3D LiDAR SLAM, the state-of-the-art methods may fail to effectively recognize the loop in real time, and usually cannot correct the full 6-DoF loop pose. To address this limitation, we present a novel Bag of Words for real-time loop closing in 3D LiDAR SLAM, called BoW3D. Our method not only efficiently recognizes the revisited loop places, but also corrects the full 6-DoF loop pose in real time. BoW3D builds the bag of words based on the 3D LiDAR feature LinK3D, which is efficient, pose-invariant and can be used for accurate point-to-point matching. We furthermore embed our proposed method into 3D LiDAR odometry system to evaluate loop closing performance. We test our method on public dataset, and compare it against other state-of-the-art algorithms. BoW3D shows better performance in terms of F1 max and extended precision scores on most scenarios. It is noticeable that BoW3D takes an average of 48 ms to recognize and correct the loops on KITTI 00 (includes 4K+ 64-ray LiDAR scans), when executed on a notebook with an Intel Core i7 @2.2 GHz processor. We release the implementation of our method here: https://github.com/YungeCui/BoW3D.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)/ICRA 2023</p></details> |

| **[A Benchmark for Multi-Modal Lidar SLAM with Ground Truth in GNSS-Denied Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00812v1)** | 2022-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lidar-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) approaches have obtained considerable success in autonomous robotic systems. This is in part owing to the high-accuracy of robust SLAM algorithms and the emergence of new and lower-cost lidar products. This study benchmarks current state-of-the-art lidar SLAM algorithms with a multi-modal lidar sensor setup showcasing diverse scanning modalities (spinning and solid-state) and sensing technologies, and lidar cameras, mounted on a mobile sensing and computing platform. We extend our previous multi-modal multi-lidar dataset with additional sequences and new sources of ground truth data. Specifically, we propose a new multi-modal multi-lidar SLAM-assisted and ICP-based sensor fusion method for generating ground truth maps. With these maps, we then match real-time pointcloud data using a natural distribution transform (NDT) method to obtain the ground truth with full 6 DOF pose estimation. This novel ground truth data leverages high-resolution spinning and solid-state lidars. We also include new open road sequences with GNSS-RTK data and additional indoor sequences with motion capture (MOCAP) ground truth, complementing the previous forest sequences with MOCAP data. We perform an analysis of the positioning accuracy achieved with ten different SLAM algorithm and lidar combinations. We also report the resource utilization in four different computational platforms and a total of five settings (Intel and Jetson ARM CPUs). Our experimental results show that current state-of-the-art lidar SLAM algorithms perform very differently for different types of sensors.

| **[PlaneSLAM: Plane-based LiDAR SLAM for Motion Planning in Structured 3D Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08248v2)** | 2022-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR sensors are a powerful tool for robot simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) in unknown environments, but the raw point clouds they produce are dense, computationally expensive to store, and unsuited for direct use by downstream autonomy tasks, such as motion planning. For integration with motion planning, it is desirable for SLAM pipelines to generate lightweight geometric map representations. Such representations are also particularly well-suited for man-made environments, which can often be viewed as a so-called "Manhattan world" built on a Cartesian grid. In this work we present a 3D LiDAR SLAM algorithm for Manhattan world environments which extracts planar features from point clouds to achieve lightweight, real-time localization and mapping. Our approach generates plane-based maps which occupy significantly less memory than their point cloud equivalents, and are suited towards fast collision checking for motion planning. By leveraging the Manhattan world assumption, we target extraction of orthogonal planes to generate maps which are more structured and organized than those of existing plane-based LiDAR SLAM approaches. We demonstrate our approach in the high-fidelity AirSim simulator and in real-world experiments with a ground rover equipped with a Velodyne LiDAR. For both cases, we are able to generate high quality maps and trajectory estimates at a rate matching the sensor rate of 10 Hz.</p></details> |  |
| **[LMBAO: A Landmark Map for Bundle Adjustment Odometry in LiDAR SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08810v1)** | 2022-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR odometry is one of the essential parts of LiDAR simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). However, existing LiDAR odometry tends to match a new scan simply iteratively with previous fixed-pose scans, gradually accumulating errors. Furthermore, as an effective joint optimization mechanism, bundle adjustment (BA) cannot be directly introduced into real-time odometry due to the intensive computation of large-scale global landmarks. Therefore, this letter designs a new strategy named a landmark map for bundle adjustment odometry (LMBAO) in LiDAR SLAM to solve these problems. First, BA-based odometry is further developed with an active landmark maintenance strategy for a more accurate local registration and avoiding cumulative errors. Specifically, this paper keeps entire stable landmarks on the map instead of just their feature points in the sliding window and deletes the landmarks according to their active grade. Next, the sliding window length is reduced, and marginalization is performed to retain the scans outside the window but corresponding to active landmarks on the map, greatly simplifying the computation and improving the real-time properties. In addition, experiments on three challenging datasets show that our algorithm achieves real-time performance in outdoor driving and outperforms state-of-the-art LiDAR SLAM algorithms, including Lego-LOAM and VLOM.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 tables, 6 figures</p></details> |

While most of these SLAM systems use Visual and LiDAR sensors in tandem with an odometry sensor, these odometry sensors drift over time. To combat this drift, Visual SLAM systems deploy compute and memory intensive search algorithms to detect `Loop Closures', which make the trajectory estimate globally consistent. To circumvent these resource (compute and memory) intensive algorithms, we present ViWiD, which integrates WiFi and Visual sensors in a dual-layered system. This dual-layered approach separates the tasks of local and global trajectory estimation making ViWiD resource efficient while achieving on-par or better performance to state-of-the-art Visual SLAM. We demonstrate ViWiD's performance on four datasets, covering over 1500 m of traversed path and show 4.3x and 4x reduction in compute and memory consumption respectively compared to state-of-the-art Visual and Lidar SLAM systems with on par SLAM performance.</p></details> |  |

We propose a scheme that fuses map prior and vanishing points from images, which can establish an energy term that is only constrained on rotation, called the direction projection error. Then we embed these direction priors into a visual-LiDAR SLAM system that integrates camera and LiDAR measurements in a tightly-coupled way at backend. Specifically, our method generates visual reprojection error and point to Implicit Moving Least Square(IMLS) surface of scan constraints, and solves them jointly along with direction projection error at global optimization. Experiments on KITTI, KITTI-360 and Oxford Radar Robotcar show that we achieve lower localization error or Absolute Pose Error (APE) than prior map, which validates our method is effective.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages (including supplementary material), accepted by PRCV 2022</p></details> |

Fusing data from landmark sensors and a strap-down Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) in an adaptive Kalman filter (KF) plus the observability of the system are investigated. In addition to the vehicle's states and landmark positions, a self-tuning filter estimates the IMU calibration parameters as well as the covariance of the measurement noise. The discrete-time covariance matrix of the process noise, the state transition matrix, and the observation sensitivity matrix are derived in closed-form making them suitable for real-time implementation. Examining the observability of the 3D SLAM system leads to the conclusion that the system remains observable upon a geometrical condition on the alignment of the landmarks.</p></details> |  |

Etna, Sicily, an environment analogous to the Moon and Mars, using a hand-held sensor suite with attributes suitable for implementation on a space-like mobile rover. The environment is characterized by challenging conditions regarding both the visual and structural appearance: severe visual aliasing poses significant limitations to the ability of visual SLAM systems to perform place recognition, while the absence of outstanding structural details, joined with the limited Field-of-View of the utilized Solid-State LiDAR sensor, challenges traditional LiDAR SLAM for the task of pose estimation using point clouds alone. With this data, that covers more than 4 kilometers of travel on soft volcanic slopes, we aim to: 1) provide a tool to expose limitations of state-of-the-art SLAM systems with respect to environments, which are not present in widely available datasets and 2) motivate the development of novel localization and mapping approaches, that rely efficiently on the complementary capabilities of the two sensors.

The dataset includes data from two commercially available devices - a stereoscopic-inertial camera and a multi-beam 3D LiDAR, which also provides inertial measurements. Additionally, we used a tripod-mounted survey grade LiDAR scanner to capture a detailed millimeter-accurate 3D map of the test location (containing $\sim$290 million points). Using the map we inferred centimeter-accurate 6 Degree of Freedom (DoF) ground truth for the position of the device for each LiDAR scan to enable better evaluation of LiDAR and vision localisation, mapping and reconstruction systems. This ground truth is the particular novel contribution of this dataset and we believe that it will enable systematic evaluation which many similar datasets have lacked. The dataset combines both built environments, open spaces and vegetated areas so as to test localization and mapping systems such as vision-based navigation, visual and LiDAR SLAM, 3D LIDAR reconstruction and appearance-based place recognition.

However, most of the current lidar SLAM approaches are based on the assumption of a static environment. Hence the localization in a dynamic environment with multiple moving objects is actually unreliable. The paper proposes a dynamic SLAM framework RF-LIO, building on LIO-SAM, which adds adaptive multi-resolution range images and uses tightly-coupled lidar inertial odometry to first remove moving objects, and then match lidar scan to the submap. Thus, it can obtain accurate poses even in high dynamic environments. The proposed RF-LIO is evaluated on both self-collected datasets and open Urbanloco datasets. The experimental results in high dynamic environments demonstrate that, compared with LOAM and LIO-SAM, the absolute trajectory accuracy of the proposed RF-LIO can be improved by 90% and 70%, respectively. RF-LIO is one of the state-of-the-art SLAM systems in high dynamic environments.</p></details> |  |

However, LiDARs do not perform well in geometrically-degraded environments, due to the challenge of loop closure detection and computational load to perform scan matching. Existing WiFi infrastructure can be exploited for localization and mapping with low hardware and computational cost. Yet, accurate pose estimation using WiFi is challenging as different signal values can be measured at the same location due to the unpredictability of signal propagation. Therefore, we introduce the use of WiFi fingerprint sequence for pose estimation (i.e. loop closure) in SLAM. This approach exploits the spatial coherence of location fingerprints obtained while a mobile robot is moving. This has better capability of correcting odometry drift. The method also incorporates LiDAR scans and thus, improving computational efficiency for large and geometrically-degraded environments while maintaining the accuracy of LiDAR SLAM. We conducted experiments in an indoor environment to illustrate the effectiveness of the method. The results are evaluated based on Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and it has achieved an accuracy of 0.88m for the test environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by the 2022 IEEE 18th International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE)</p></details> |

In particular, ground-optimized LiDAR odometry usually employs ground segmentation as a preprocessing method. This is because most of the points in a 3D point cloud captured by a 3D LiDAR sensor on a terrestrial platform are from the ground. However, the effect of the performance of ground segmentation on LiDAR odometry is still not closely examined. In this paper, a robust ground-optimized LiDAR odometry framework is proposed to facilitate the study to check the effect of ground segmentation on LiDAR SLAM based on the state-of-the-art (SOTA) method. By using our proposed odometry framework, it is easy and straightforward to test whether ground segmentation algorithms help extract well-described features and thus improve SLAM performance. In addition, by leveraging the SOTA ground segmentation method called Patchwork, which shows robust ground segmentation even in complex and uneven urban environments with little performance perturbation, a novel ground-optimized LiDAR odometry is proposed, called PaGO-LOAM. The methods were tested using the KITTI odometry dataset. \textit{PaGO-LOAM} shows robust and accurate performance compared with the baseline method.

However, place recognition and geometric verification using these landmarks is challenging due to the requirement for global matching without an initial guess. Existing works typically only leverage either pole or plane landmarks, limiting application to a restricted set of environments. We present a global data association method for loop closure in lidar scans using 3D line and plane objects simultaneously and in a unified manner. The main novelty of this paper is in the representation of line and plane objects extracted from lidar scans on the manifold of affine subspaces, known as the affine Grassmannian. Line and plane correspondences are matched using our graph-based data association framework and subsequently registered in the least-squares sense. Compared to pole-only approaches and plane-only approaches, our 3D affine Grassmannian method yields a 71% and 325% increase respectively to loop closure recall at 100% precision on the KITTI dataset and can provide frame alignment with less than 10 cm and 1 deg of error.</p></details> |  |

Removing dynamic object is crucial in this situation but become tricky when ego-motion is coupled. In this paper, instead of proposing a new slam framework, we aim at a more general strategy for a localization scenario.

Then we proposed Dynamic Registration, to iteratively estimate ego-motion and segment moving objects until no static object generates. Static objects are merged with the environment. Finally, we successfully segment dynamic objects, static environments with static objects, and ego-motion estimation in a dynamic environment. We evaluate the performance of our proposed method on KITTI Tracking datasets.

The high-rate inertial data complement the other lower-rate modalities. Moreover, in the absence of constant acceleration, the gravity vector makes two attitude angles out of three observable in the global coordinate frame. In visual odometry, this is already being used to reduce the 6-Degrees Of Freedom (DOF) pose estimation problem to 4-DOF. In lidar SLAM, the gravity measurements are often used as a penalty in the back-end global map optimization to prevent map deformations. In this work, we propose an Iterative Closest Point (ICP)-based front-end which exploits the observable DOF and provides pose estimates aligned with the gravity vector. We believe that this front-end has the potential to support the loop closure identification, thus speeding up convergences of global map optimizations. The presented approach has been extensively tested in large-scale outdoor environments as well as in the Subterranean Challenge organized by Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). We show that it can reduce the localization drift by 30% when compared to the standard 6-DOF ICP. Moreover, the code is readily available to the community as a part of the libpointmatcher library.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

| **[DL-SLOT: Dynamic Lidar SLAM and Object Tracking Based On Graph Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.11431v1)** | 2022-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ego-pose estimation and dynamic object tracking are two key issues in an autonomous driving system. Two assumptions are often made for them, i.e. the static world assumption of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and the exact ego-pose assumption of object tracking, respectively. However, these assumptions are difficult to hold in highly dynamic road scenarios where SLAM and object tracking become correlated and mutually beneficial. In this paper, DL-SLOT, a dynamic Lidar SLAM and object tracking method is proposed. This method integrates the state estimations of both the ego vehicle and the static and dynamic objects in the environment into a unified optimization framework, to realize SLAM and object tracking (SLOT) simultaneously. Firstly, we implement object detection to remove all the points that belong to potential dynamic objects. Then, LiDAR odometry is conducted using the filtered point cloud. At the same time, detected objects are associated with the history object trajectories based on the time-series information in a sliding window. The states of the static and dynamic objects and ego vehicle in the sliding window are integrated into a unified local optimization framework. We perform SLAM and object tracking simultaneously in this framework, which significantly improves the robustness and accuracy of SLAM in highly dynamic road scenarios and the accuracy of objects' states estimation. Experiments on public datasets have shown that our method achieves better accuracy than A-LOAM.</p></details> |  |

Over the years, several deep learning approaches have been proposed to address this task, however their performance has been subpar compared to handcrafted techniques, especially while dealing with reverse loops. In this paper, we introduce the novel LCDNet that effectively detects loop closures in LiDAR point clouds by simultaneously identifying previously visited places and estimating the 6-DoF relative transformation between the current scan and the map. LCDNet is composed of a shared encoder, a place recognition head that extracts global descriptors, and a relative pose head that estimates the transformation between two point clouds. We introduce a novel relative pose head based on the unbalanced optimal transport theory that we implement in a differentiable manner to allow for end-to-end training. Extensive evaluations of LCDNet on multiple real-world autonomous driving datasets show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art loop closure detection and point cloud registration techniques by a large margin, especially while dealing with reverse loops. Moreover, we integrate our proposed loop closure detection approach into a LiDAR SLAM library to provide a complete mapping system and demonstrate the generalization ability using different sensor setup in an unseen city.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Robotics (T-RO), 2022</p></details> |

To do so, light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensor-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) technology have been elaborated. To compose a full SLAM system, many odometry and place recognition methods have independently been proposed in academia. However, they have hardly been integrated or too tightly combined so that exchanging (upgrading) either single odometry or place recognition module is very effort demanding. Recently, the performance of each module has been improved a lot, so it is necessary to build a SLAM system that can effectively integrate them and easily replace them with the latest one.

| **[A Universal LiDAR SLAM Accelerator System on Low-cost FPGA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.09523v2)** | 2021-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) serves as a basis for indoor cleaning, navigation, and many other useful applications in both industry and household. From a series of LiDAR scans, it constructs an accurate, globally consistent model of the environment and estimates a robot position inside it. SLAM is inherently computationally intensive; it is a challenging problem to realize a fast and reliable SLAM system on mobile robots with a limited processing capability. To overcome such hurdles, in this paper, we propose a universal, low-power, and resource-efficient accelerator design for 2D LiDAR SLAM targeting resource-limited FPGAs. As scan matching is at the heart of SLAM, the proposed accelerator consists of dedicated scan matching cores on the programmable logic part, and provides software interfaces to facilitate the use. Our accelerator can be integrated to various SLAM methods including the ROS (Robot Operating System)-based ones, and users can switch to a different method without modifying and re-synthesizing the logic part. We integrate the accelerator into three widely-used methods, i.e., scan matching, particle filter, and graph-based SLAM. We evaluate the design in terms of resource utilization, speed, and quality of output results using real-world datasets. Experiment results on a Pynq-Z2 board demonstrate that our design accelerates scan matching and loop-closure detection tasks by up to 14.84x and 18.92x, yielding 4.67x, 4.00x, and 4.06x overall performance improvement in the above methods, respectively. Our design enables the real-time performance while consuming only 2.4W and maintaining accuracy, which is comparable to the software counterparts and even the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

In most of these systems, they extract features for tracking after ground removal, which causes large variance on the z-axis. Ground actually provides robust information to obtain [t_z, \theta_{roll}, \theta_{pitch}]$. In this project, we followed the LeGO-LOAM, a light-weighted real-time SLAM system that extracts and registers ground as an addition to the original LOAM, and we proposed a new clustering-based method to refine the planar extraction algorithm for ground such that the system can handle much more noisy or dynamic environments. We implemented this method and compared it with LeGo-LOAM on our collected data of CMU campus, as well as a collected dataset for ATV (All-Terrain Vehicle) for off-road self-driving.

To achieve such a comprehensive sensor fusion system, one has to tackle several challenges such as data synchronization, multi-threading programming, bundle adjustment (BA), and conflicting coordinate frames between UWB and the onboard sensors, so as to ensure real-time localization and smooth updates in the state estimates. To this end, we propose a two stage approach. In the first stage, lidar, camera, and IMU data on a local sliding window are processed in a core odometry thread. From this local graph, new key frames are evaluated for admission to a global map. Visual feature-based loop closure is also performed to supplement the global factor graph with loop constraints. When the global factor graph satisfies a condition on spatial diversity, the BA process will be triggered to update the coordinate transform between UWB and onboard SLAM systems. The system then seamlessly transitions to the second stage where all sensors are tightly integrated in the odometry thread. The capability of our system is demonstrated via several experiments on high-fidelity graphical-physical simulation and public datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[AEROS: Adaptive RObust least-Squares for Graph-Based SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.02018v1)** | 2021-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In robot localisation and mapping, outliers are unavoidable when loop-closure measurements are taken into account. A single false-positive loop-closure can have a very negative impact on SLAM problems causing an inferior trajectory to be produced or even for the optimisation to fail entirely. To address this issue, popular existing approaches define a hard switch for each loop-closure constraint. This paper presents AEROS, a novel approach to adaptively solve a robust least-squares minimisation problem by adding just a single extra latent parameter. It can be used in the back-end component of the SLAM problem to enable generalised robust cost minimisation by simultaneously estimating the continuous latent parameter along with the set of sensor poses in a single joint optimisation. This leads to a very closely curve fitting on the distribution of the residuals, thereby reducing the effect of outliers. Additionally, we formulate the robust optimisation problem using standard Gaussian factors so that it can be solved by direct application of popular incremental estimation approaches such as iSAM. Experimental results on publicly available synthetic datasets and real LiDAR-SLAM datasets collected from the 2D and 3D LiDAR systems show the competitiveness of our approach with the state-of-the-art techniques and its superiority on real world scenarios.</p></details> | 13 |

Although some systems exist already, they are either not accurate or they struggle in real-time setting. In this paper, we propose a fast, accurate and modular LiDAR SLAM system for both batch and online estimation. We first apply downsampling and outlier removal, to filter out noise and reduce the size of the input point clouds. Filtered clouds are then used for pose tracking and floor detection, to ground-optimize the estimated trajectory. The availability of a pre-tracker, working in parallel with the filtering process, allows to obtain pre-computed odometries, to be used as aids when performing tracking. Efficient loop closure and pose optimization, achieved through a g2o pose graph, are the last steps of the proposed SLAM pipeline. We compare the performance of our system with state-of-the-art point cloud based methods, LOAM, LeGO-LOAM, A-LOAM, LeGO-LOAM-BOR and HDL, and show that the proposed system achieves equal or better accuracy and can easily handle even cases without loops. The comparison is done evaluating the estimated trajectory displacement using the KITTI and RADIATE datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is currently under review</p></details> |

Against the backdrop of more affordable 3D LiDAR sensors, research on 3D LiDAR SLAM is becoming increasingly popular. Furthermore, the re-localization problem with a point cloud map is the foundation for other SLAM applications. In this paper, a template matching framework is proposed to re-localize a robot globally in a 3D LiDAR map. This presents two main challenges. First, most global descriptors for point cloud can only be used for place detection under a small local area. Therefore, in order to re-localize globally in the map, point clouds and descriptors(templates) are densely collected using a reconstructed mesh model at an offline stage by a physical simulation engine to expand the functional distance of point cloud descriptors. Second, the increased number of collected templates makes the matching stage too slow to meet the real-time requirement, for which a cascade matching method is presented for better efficiency. In the experiments, the proposed framework achieves 0.2-meter accuracy at about 10Hz matching speed using pure python implementation with 100k templates, which is effective and efficient for SLAM applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

In this paper, we present a novel semantic-aided LiDAR SLAM with loop closure based on LOAM, named SA-LOAM, which leverages semantics in odometry as well as loop closure detection. Specifically, we propose a semantic-assisted ICP, including semantically matching, downsampling and plane constraint, and integrates a semantic graph-based place recognition method in our loop closure detection module. Benefitting from semantics, we can improve the localization accuracy, detect loop closures effectively, and construct a global consistent semantic map even in large-scale scenes.

This is particularly useful in indoor environments where other localization technologies, such as GNSS, fail. Indoor spaces impose interesting challenges on visual localization algorithms: occlusions due to people, textureless surfaces, large viewpoint changes, low light, repetitive textures, etc. Existing indoor datasets are either comparably small or do only cover a subset of the mentioned challenges. In this paper, we introduce 5 new indoor datasets for visual localization in challenging real-world environments. They were captured in a large shopping mall and a large metro station in Seoul, South Korea, using a dedicated mapping platform consisting of 10 cameras and 2 laser scanners. In order to obtain accurate ground truth camera poses, we developed a robust LiDAR SLAM which provides initial poses that are then refined using a novel structure-from-motion based optimization. We present a benchmark of modern visual localization algorithms on these challenging datasets showing superior performance of structure-based methods using robust image features.

To this end, we propose MULLS, an efficient, low-drift, and versatile 3D LiDAR SLAM system. For the front-end, roughly classified feature points (ground, facade, pillar, beam, etc.) are extracted from each frame using dual-threshold ground filtering and principal components analysis. Then the registration between the current frame and the local submap is accomplished efficiently by the proposed multi-metric linear least square iterative closest point algorithm. Point-to-point (plane, line) error metrics within each point class are jointly optimized with a linear approximation to estimate the ego-motion. Static feature points of the registered frame are appended into the local map to keep it updated. For the back-end, hierarchical pose graph optimization is conducted among regularly stored history submaps to reduce the drift resulting from dead reckoning. Extensive experiments are carried out on three datasets with more than 100,000 frames collected by seven types of LiDAR on various outdoor and indoor scenarios. On the KITTI benchmark, MULLS ranks among the top LiDAR-only SLAM systems with real-time performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Codes...</summary><p>Codes: https://github.com/YuePanEdward/MULLS, Accepted by ICRA 2021</p></details> |

However, camera and LiDAR based SLAM systems can be fragile when facing challenging illumination or weather conditions which degrade their imagery and point cloud data. Radar, whose operating electromagnetic spectrum is less affected by environmental changes, is promising although its distinct sensing geometry and noise characteristics bring open challenges when being exploited for SLAM. % However, there are still open challenges since most existing visual and LiDAR SLAM systems do not operate in bad weathers. This paper studies the use of a Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave radar for SLAM in large-scale outdoor environments. We propose a full radar SLAM system, including a novel radar motion tracking algorithm that leverages radar geometry for reliable feature tracking. It also optimally compensates motion distortion and estimates pose by joint optimization. Its loop closure component is designed to be simple yet efficient for radar imagery by capturing and exploiting structural information of the surrounding environment. % while a scheme to reject ambiguous loop closure candidates is also designed specifically for radar. Extensive experiments on three public radar datasets, ranging from city streets and residential areas to countryside and highways, show competitive accuracy and reliability performance of the proposed radar SLAM system compared to the state-of-the-art LiDAR, vision and radar methods. The results show that our system is technically viable in achieving reliable SLAM in extreme weather conditions, e.g. heavy snow and dense fog, demonstrating the promising potential of using radar for all-weather localization and mapping.</p></details> | Under review |

To overcome this challenge and support the deployment of robots in real world scenarios, we propose a complete solution for a dynamic object aware LiDAR SLAM algorithm. This is achieved by leveraging a real-time capable neural network that can detect dynamic objects, thus allowing our system to deal with them explicitly. To efficiently generate the necessary training data which is key to our approach, we present a novel end-to-end occupancy grid based pipeline that can automatically label a wide variety of arbitrary dynamic objects. Our solution can thus generalize to different environments without the need for expensive manual labeling and at the same time avoids assumptions about the presence of a predefined set of known objects in the scene. Using this technique, we automatically label over 12000 LiDAR scans collected in an urban environment with a large amount of pedestrians and use this data to train a neural network, achieving an average segmentation IoU of 0.82. We show that explicitly dealing with dynamic objects can improve the LiDAR SLAM odometry performance by 39.6% while yielding maps which better represent the environments.

However, they commonly have a high latency due to the expensive data association and nonlinear optimization. This paper demonstrates that actively selecting a subset of features significantly improves both the accuracy and efficiency of an L-SLAM system. We formulate the feature selection as a combinatorial optimization problem under a cardinality constraint to preserve the information matrix's spectral attributes. The stochastic-greedy algorithm is applied to approximate the optimal results in real-time. To avoid ill-conditioned estimation, we also propose a general strategy to evaluate the environment's degeneracy and modify the feature number online. The proposed feature selector is integrated into a multi-LiDAR SLAM system. We validate this enhanced system with extensive experiments covering various scenarios on two sensor setups and computation platforms. We show that our approach exhibits low localization error and speedup compared to the state-of-the-art L-SLAM systems.

To make a lightweight the algorithm, most SLAM systems rely on feature detection from images for vision SLAM or point cloud for laser-based methods. Feature detection through a 3D point cloud becomes a computationally challenging task. In this paper, we propose a feature detection method by projecting a 3D point cloud to form an image and apply the vision-based feature detection technique. The proposed method gives repeatable and stable features in a variety of environments. Based on such features, we build a 6-DOF SLAM system consisting of tracking, mapping, and loop closure threads. For loop detection, we employ a 2-step approach i.e. nearest key-frames detection and loop candidate verification by matching features extracted from rasterized LIDAR images. Furthermore, we utilize a key-frame structure to achieve a lightweight SLAM system. The proposed system is evaluated with implementation on the KITTI dataset and the University of Michigan Ford Campus dataset. Through experimental results, we show that the algorithm presented in this paper can substantially reduce the computational cost of feature detection from the point cloud and the whole SLAM system while giving accurate results.</p></details> |  |

Existing SLAM methods are mainly developed for mechanical LiDAR sensors, which are often adopted by large scale robots. Recently, the solid-state LiDAR is introduced and becomes popular since it provides a cost-effective and lightweight solution for small scale robots. Compared to mechanical LiDAR, solid-state LiDAR sensors have higher update frequency and angular resolution, but also have smaller field of view (FoV), which is very challenging for existing LiDAR SLAM algorithms. Therefore, it is necessary to have a more robust and computationally efficient SLAM method for this new sensing device. To this end, we propose a new SLAM framework for solid-state LiDAR sensors, which involves feature extraction, odometry estimation, and probability map building. The proposed method is evaluated on a warehouse robot and a hand-held device. In the experiments, we demonstrate both the accuracy and efficiency of our method using an Intel L515 solid-state LiDAR.

It is widely used in robotic applications such as autonomous driving and drone delivery. Traditional LiDAR-based SLAM algorithms mainly leverage the geometric features from the scene context, while the intensity information from LiDAR is ignored. Some recent deep-learning-based SLAM algorithms consider intensity features and train the pose estimation network in an end-to-end manner. However, they require significant data collection effort and their generalizability to environments other than the trained one remains unclear. In this paper we introduce intensity features to a SLAM system. And we propose a novel full SLAM framework that leverages both geometry and intensity features. The proposed SLAM involves both intensity-based front-end odometry estimation and intensity-based back-end optimization.

| **[BALM: Bundle Adjustment for Lidar Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08215v2)** | 2021-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A local Bundle Adjustment (BA) on a sliding window of keyframes has been widely used in visual SLAM and proved to be very effective in lowering the drift. But in lidar SLAM, BA method is hardly used because the sparse feature points (e.g., edge and plane) make the exact point matching impossible. In this paper, we formulate the lidar BA as minimizing the distance from a feature point to its matched edge or plane. Unlike the visual SLAM (and prior plane adjustment method in lidar SLAM) where the feature has to be co-determined along with the pose, we show that the feature can be analytically solved and removed from the BA, the resultant BA is only dependent on the scan poses. This greatly reduces the optimization scale and allows large-scale dense plane and edge features to be used. To speedup the optimization, we derive the analytical derivatives of the cost function, up to second order, in closed form. Moreover, we propose a novel adaptive voxelization method to search feature correspondence efficiently. The proposed formulations are incorporated into a LOAM back-end for map refinement. Results show that, although as a back-end, the local BA can be solved very efficiently, even in real-time at 10Hz when optimizing 20 scans of point-cloud. The local BA also considerably lowers the LOAM drift. Our implementation of the BA optimization and LOAM are open-sourced to benefit the community.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 9 figures, conference</p></details> |

To attain high spatial and temporal fidelity in field conditions, we propose the application of continuous-time 3D SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping) to a spinning lidar payload (AgScan3D) mounted on a moving farm vehicle. The AgScan3D data is processed through a Continuous-Time SLAM algorithm into a globally registered 3D ray cloud. The global ray cloud is a canonical data format (a digital twin) from which we can compare vineyard snapshots over multiple times within a season and across seasons. Then, the vineyard rows are automatically extracted from the ray cloud and a novel density calculation is performed to estimate the maximum likelihood canopy densities of the vineyard. This combination of digital twinning, together with the accurate extraction of canopy structure information, allows entire vineyards to be analysed and compared, across the growing season and from year to year. The proposed method is evaluated both in simulation and field experiments. Field experiments were performed at four sites, which varied in vineyard structure and vine management, over two growing seasons and 64 data collection campaigns, resulting in a total traversal of 160 kilometres, 42.4 scanned hectares of vines with a combined total of approximately 93,000 scanned vines. Our experiments show canopy density repeatability of 3.8% (Relative RMSE) per vineyard panel, for acquisition speeds of 5-6 km/h, and under half the standard deviation in estimated densities when compared to an industry standard gap-fraction based solution.

However, LiDAR-SLAM suffers from accumulating errors which can be significantly mitigated by Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). Precise Point Positioning (PPP), an accurate GNSS operation mode independent of base stations, gains more popularity in unmanned systems. Considering the features of the two technologies, LiDAR-SLAM and PPP, this paper proposes a SLAM system, namely P3-LOAM (PPP based LiDAR Odometry and Mapping) which couples LiDAR-SLAM and PPP. For better integration, we derive LiDAR-SLAM positioning covariance by using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) Jacobian model, since SVD provides an explicit analytic solution of Iterative Closest Point (ICP), which is a key issue in LiDAR-SLAM. A novel method is then proposed to evaluate the estimated LiDAR-SLAM covariance. In addition, to increase the reliability of GNSS in urban canyon environment, we develop a LiDAR-SLAM assisted GNSS Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM) algorithm. Finally, we validate P$^3$-LOAM with UrbanNav, a challenging public dataset in urban canyon environment.

Recent development of low-cost lidars (e.g. Livox lidar) enable us to explore such SLAM systems with lower budget and higher performance. In this paper we propose CamVox by adapting Livox lidars into visual SLAM (ORB-SLAM2) by exploring the lidars' unique features. Based on the non-repeating nature of Livox lidars, we propose an automatic lidar-camera calibration method that will work in uncontrolled scenes. The long depth detection range also benefit a more efficient mapping. Comparison of CamVox with visual SLAM (VINS-mono) and lidar SLAM (LOAM) are evaluated on the same dataset to demonstrate the performance.

| **[An FPGA Acceleration and Optimization Techniques for 2D LiDAR SLAM Algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.01050v2)** | 2020-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An efficient hardware implementation for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) methods is of necessity for mobile autonomous robots with limited computational resources. In this paper, we propose a resource-efficient FPGA implementation for accelerating scan matching computations, which typically cause a major bottleneck in 2D LiDAR SLAM methods. Scan matching is a process of correcting a robot pose by aligning the latest LiDAR measurements with an occupancy grid map, which encodes the information about the surrounding environment. We exploit an inherent parallelism in the Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filter (RBPF) based algorithms to perform scan matching computations for multiple particles in parallel. In the proposed design, several techniques are employed to reduce the resource utilization and to achieve the maximum throughput. Experimental results using the benchmark datasets show that the scan matching is accelerated by 5.31-8.75x and the overall throughput is improved by 3.72-5.10x without seriously degrading the quality of the final outputs. Furthermore, our proposed IP core requires only 44% of the total resources available in the TUL Pynq-Z2 FPGA board, thus facilitating the realization of SLAM applications on indoor mobile robots.</p></details> |  |

Satisfactory performance can be obtained using high-grade 3D LiDAR with 64 channels, which can provide dense point clouds. Unfortunately, the high price significantly prevents its extensive commercialization in ADV. The cost-effective 3D LiDAR with 16 channels is a promising replacement. However, only limited and sparse point clouds can be provided by the 16 channels LiDAR, which cannot guarantee sufficient positioning accuracy for ADV in challenging dynamic environments. The high-resolution image from the low-cost camera can provide ample information about the surroundings. However, the explicit depth information is not available from the image. Inspired by the complementariness of 3D LiDAR and camera, this paper proposes to make use of the high-resolution images from a camera to enrich the raw 3D point clouds from the low-cost 16 channels LiDAR based on a state-of-the-art deep learning algorithm. An ERFNet is firstly employed to segment the image with the aid of the raw sparse 3D point clouds. Meanwhile, the sparse convolutional neural network is employed to predict the dense point clouds based on raw sparse 3D point clouds. Then, the predicted dense point clouds are fused with the segmentation outputs from ERFnet using a novel multi-layer convolutional neural network to refine the predicted 3D point clouds. Finally, the enriched point clouds are employed to perform LiDAR SLAM based on the state-of-the-art normal distribution transform (NDT). We tested our approach on the re-edited KITTI datasets: (1)the sparse 3D point clouds are significantly enriched with a mean square error of 1.1m MSE. (2)the map generated from the LiDAR SLAM is denser which includes more details without significant accuracy loss.</p></details> |  |

This approach reduces the cost of loop closure while still provides large-scale fusion-based dense maps, when compared to the trajectory-centric SLAM approaches. In this paper, we present a novel framework for 3D LiDAR-based map-centric SLAM. Having the advantages of a map-centric approach, our method exhibits new features to overcome the shortcomings of existing systems, associated with multi-modal sensor fusion and LiDAR motion distortion. This is accomplished through the use of a local Continuous-Time (CT) trajectory representation. Also, our surface resolution preservative matching algorithm and Wishart-based surfel fusion model enables non-redundant yet dense mapping. Furthermore, we present a robust metric loop closure model to make the approach stable regardless of where the loop closure occurs.

We utilize spatial GP regression to model the environment. This tool enables us to recover surfaces including those in sparsely scanned areas and obtain uniform samples with uncertainty. Those properties facilitate robust data association and map updating in our scan-to-map registration scheme, especially when working with sparse range data. Compared with previous GP-SLAM, this work overcomes the prohibitive computational complexity of GP and redesigns the registration strategy to meet the accuracy requirements in 3D scenarios. For large-scale tasks, a two-thread framework is employed to suppress the drift further. Aerial and ground-based experiments demonstrate that our method allows robust odometry and precise mapping in real-time.

Point clouds are accumulated using an inertial-kinematic state estimator before being aligned using ICP registration. To close loops we use a loop proposal mechanism which matches individual segments between clouds. We trained a descriptor offline to match these segments. The efficiency of our method comes from carefully designing the network architecture to minimize the number of parameters such that this deep learning method can be deployed in real-time using only the CPU of a legged robot, a major contribution of this work. The set of odometry and loop closure factors are updated using pose graph optimization.

We use DNNs to model the highly non-convex mapping process that traditionally involves hand-crafted data association, sensor pose initialization, and global refinement. Our key novelty is that "training" these DNNs with properly defined unsupervised losses is equivalent to solving the underlying registration problem, but less sensitive to good initialization than ICP. Our framework contains two DNNs: a localization network that estimates the poses for input point clouds, and a map network that models the scene structure by estimating the occupancy status of global coordinates. This allows us to convert the registration problem to a binary occupancy classification, which can be solved efficiently using gradient-based optimization. We further show that DeepMapping can be readily extended to address the problem of Lidar SLAM by imposing geometric constraints between consecutive point clouds. Experiments are conducted on both simulated and real datasets. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons demonstrate that DeepMapping often enables more robust and accurate global registration of multiple point clouds than existing techniques.

| **[A Chefs KISS -- Utilizing semantic information in both ICP and SLAM framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02086v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For utilizing autonomous vehicle in urban areas a reliable localization is needed. Especially when HD maps are used, a precise and repeatable method has to be chosen. Therefore accurate map generation but also re-localization against these maps is necessary. Due to best 3D reconstruction of the surrounding, LiDAR has become a reliable modality for localization. The latest LiDAR odometry estimation are based on iterative closest point (ICP) approaches, namely KISS-ICP and SAGE-ICP. We extend the capabilities of KISS-ICP by incorporating semantic information into the point alignment process using a generalizable approach with minimal parameter tuning. This enhancement allows us to surpass KISS-ICP in terms of absolute trajectory error (ATE), the primary metric for map accuracy. Additionally, we improve the Cartographer mapping framework to handle semantic information. Cartographer facilitates loop closure detection over larger areas, mitigating odometry drift and further enhancing ATE accuracy. By integrating semantic information into the mapping process, we enable the filtering of specific classes, such as parked vehicles, from the resulting map. This filtering improves relocalization quality by addressing temporal changes, such as vehicles being moved.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Initialization for LiDAR-inertial SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01451v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The accuracy of the initial state, including initial velocity, gravity direction, and IMU biases, is critical for the initialization of LiDAR-inertial SLAM systems. Inaccurate initial values can reduce initialization speed or lead to failure. When the system faces urgent tasks, robust and fast initialization is required while the robot is moving, such as during the swift assessment of rescue environments after natural disasters, bomb disposal, and restarting LiDAR-inertial SLAM in rescue missions. However, existing initialization methods usually require the platform to remain stationary, which is ineffective when the robot is in motion. To address this issue, this paper introduces a robust and fast dynamic initialization method for LiDAR-inertial systems (D-LI-Init). This method iteratively aligns LiDAR-based odometry with IMU measurements to achieve system initialization. To enhance the reliability of the LiDAR odometry module, the LiDAR and gyroscope are tightly integrated within the ESIKF framework. The gyroscope compensates for rotational distortion in the point cloud. Translational distortion compensation occurs during the iterative update phase, resulting in the output of LiDAR-gyroscope odometry. The proposed method can initialize the system no matter the robot is moving or stationary. Experiments on public datasets and real-world environments demonstrate that the D-LI-Init algorithm can effectively serve various platforms, including vehicles, handheld devices, and UAVs. D-LI-Init completes dynamic initialization regardless of specific motion patterns. To benefit the research community, we have open-sourced our code and test datasets on GitHub.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics</p></details> |

In order to solve these problems, we propose a novel LIDAR-based localization framework, which achieves high accuracy and provides robust localization in 3D pointcloud maps with information of multi-sensors. The system integrates global information with LIDAR-based odometry to optimize the localization state. To improve robustness and enable fast resumption of localization, this paper uses offline pointcloud maps for prior knowledge and presents a novel registration method to speed up the convergence rate. The algorithm is tested on various maps of different data sets and has higher robustness and accuracy than other localization algorithms.</p></details> |  |

Although its success, managing an accurate and lightweight representation of the environment still poses challenges. Both classic and NeRF-based solutions have to trade off accuracy over memory and processing times. In this work, we build on recent advancements in Gaussian Splatting methods to develop a novel LiDAR odometry and mapping pipeline that exclusively relies on Gaussian primitives for its scene representation. Leveraging spherical projection, we drive the refinement of the primitives uniquely from LiDAR measurements. Experiments show that our approach matches the current registration performance, while achieving SOTA results for mapping tasks with minimal GPU requirements. This efficiency makes it a strong candidate for further exploration and potential adoption in real-time robotics estimation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[KISS-SLAM: A Simple, Robust, and Accurate 3D LiDAR SLAM System With Enhanced Generalization Capabilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12660v1)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust and accurate localization and mapping of an environment using laser scanners, so-called LiDAR SLAM, is essential to many robotic applications. Early 3D LiDAR SLAM methods often exploited additional information from IMU or GNSS sensors to enhance localization accuracy and mitigate drift. Later, advanced systems further improved the estimation at the cost of a higher runtime and complexity. This paper explores the limits of what can be achieved with a LiDAR-only SLAM approach while following the "Keep It Small and Simple" (KISS) principle. By leveraging this minimalistic design principle, our system, KISS-SLAM, archives state-of-the-art performances in pose accuracy while requiring little to no parameter tuning for deployment across diverse environments, sensors, and motion profiles. We follow best practices in graph-based SLAM and build upon LiDAR odometry to compute the relative motion between scans and construct local maps of the environment. To correct drift, we match local maps and optimize the trajectory in a pose graph optimization step. The experimental results demonstrate that this design achieves competitive performance while reducing complexity and reliance on additional sensor modalities. By prioritizing simplicity, this work provides a new strong baseline for LiDAR-only SLAM and a high-performing starting point for future research. Further, our pipeline builds consistent maps that can be used directly for further downstream tasks like navigation. Our open-source system operates faster than the sensor frame rate in all presented datasets and is designed for real-world scenarios.</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[Robustness of LiDAR-Based Pose Estimation: Evaluating and Improving Odometry and Localization Under Common Point Cloud Corruptions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10824v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and reliable pose estimation, i.e., determining the precise position and orientation of autonomous robots and vehicles, is critical for tasks like navigation and mapping. LiDAR is a widely used sensor for pose estimation, with odometry and localization being two primary tasks. LiDAR odometry estimates the relative motion between consecutive scans, while LiDAR localization aligns real-time scans with a pre-recorded map to obtain a global pose. Although they have different objectives and application scenarios, both rely on point cloud registration as the underlying technique and face shared challenges of data corruption caused by adverse conditions (e.g., rain). While state-of-the-art (SOTA) pose estimation systems achieved high accuracy on clean data, their robustness to corrupted data remains unclear. In this work, we propose a framework to systematically evaluate five SOTA LiDAR pose estimation systems across 18 synthetic real-world point cloud corruptions. Our experiments reveal that odometry systems degrade significantly under specific corruptions, with relative position errors increasing from 0.5% to more than 80%, while localization systems remain highly robust. We further demonstrate that denoising techniques can effectively mitigate the adverse effects of noise-induced corruptions, and re-training learning-based systems with corrupted data significantly enhances the robustness against various corruption types.</p></details> |  |

However, low-quality radar points hinder its application, especially the odometry task that requires a dense and accurate matching. To fully explore the potential of 4D radar, we introduce a learning-based odometry framework, enabling robust ego-motion estimation from finite and uncertain geometry information. First, for sparse radar points, we propose a local completion to supplement missing structures and provide denser guideline for aligning two frames. Then, a context-aware association with a hierarchical structure flexibly matches points of different scales aided by feature similarity, and improves local matching consistency through correlation balancing. Finally, we present a window-based optimizer that uses historical priors to establish a coupling state estimation and correct errors of inter-frame matching. The superiority of our algorithm is confirmed on View-of-Delft dataset, achieving around a 50% performance improvement over previous approaches and delivering accuracy on par with LiDAR odometry. Our code will be available.</p></details> | 7 pages, 7 figures |

Simultaneously receiving data from both the LiDAR and the camera, the framework utilizes the color information from the camera images to colorize the LiDAR point clouds and then performs iterative pose optimization. For each LiDAR scan, the edge and planar features are extracted and colored using the corresponding image and then matched to a global map. Specifically, we adopt a perceptually uniform color difference weighting strategy to exclude color correspondence outliers and a robust error metric based on the Welsch's function to mitigate the impact of positional correspondence outliers during the pose optimization process. As a result, the system achieves accurate localization and reconstructs dense, accurate, colored and three-dimensional (3D) maps of the environment. Thorough experiments with challenging scenarios, including complex forests and a campus, show that our method provides higher robustness and accuracy compared with current state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ground-Optimized 4D Radar-Inertial Odometry via Continuous Velocity Integration using Gaussian Process](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08093v2)** | 2025-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Radar ensures robust sensing capabilities in adverse weather conditions, yet challenges remain due to its high inherent noise level. Existing radar odometry has overcome these challenges with strategies such as filtering spurious points, exploiting Doppler velocity, or integrating with inertial measurements. This paper presents two novel improvements beyond the existing radar-inertial odometry: ground-optimized noise filtering and continuous velocity preintegration. Despite the widespread use of ground planes in LiDAR odometry, imprecise ground point distributions of radar measurements cause naive plane fitting to fail. Unlike plane fitting in LiDAR, we introduce a zone-based uncertainty-aware ground modeling specifically designed for radar. Secondly, we note that radar velocity measurements can be better combined with IMU for a more accurate preintegration in radar-inertial odometry. Existing methods often ignore temporal discrepancies between radar and IMU by simplifying the complexities of asynchronous data streams with discretized propagation models. Tackling this issue, we leverage GP and formulate a continuous preintegration method for tightly integrating 3-DOF linear velocity with IMU, facilitating full 6-DOF motion directly from the raw measurements. Our approach demonstrates remarkable performance (less than 1% vertical drift) in public datasets with meticulous conditions, illustrating substantial improvement in elevation accuracy.

However, in challenging environments with adverse weather conditions or repetitive geometric patterns, LiDAR odometry performance is degraded due to incorrect scan matching. Recently, the emergence of frequency-modulated continuous wave 4D LiDAR and 4D radar technologies has provided the potential to address these unfavorable conditions. The term 4D refers to point cloud data characterized by range, azimuth, and elevation along with Doppler velocity. Although 4D data is available, most scan matching methods for 4D LiDAR and 4D radar still establish correspondence by repeatedly identifying the closest points between consecutive scans, overlooking the Doppler information. This paper introduces, for the first time, a simple Doppler velocity-based correspondence -- Doppler Correspondence -- that is invariant to translation and small rotation of the sensor, with its geometric and kinematic foundations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method enables the direct matching of consecutive point clouds without an iterative process, making it computationally efficient. Additionally, it provides a more robust correspondence estimation in environments with repetitive geometric patterns.</p></details> |  |
| **[CTE-MLO: Continuous-time and Efficient Multi-LiDAR Odometry with Localizability-aware Point Cloud Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04901v2)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, LiDAR-based localization and mapping methods have achieved significant progress thanks to their reliable and real-time localization capability. Considering single LiDAR odometry often faces hardware failures and degeneracy in practical scenarios, Multi-LiDAR Odometry (MLO), as an emerging technology, is studied to enhance the performance of LiDAR-based localization and mapping systems. However, MLO can suffer from high computational complexity introduced by dense point clouds that are fused from multiple LiDARs, and the continuous-time measurement characteristic is constantly neglected by existing LiDAR odometry. This motivates us to develop a Continuous-Time and Efficient MLO, namely CTE-MLO, which can achieve accurate and real-time estimation using multi-LiDAR measurements through a continuous-time perspective. In this paper, the Gaussian process estimation is naturally combined with the Kalman filter, which enables each LiDAR point in a point stream to query the corresponding continuous-time trajectory using its time instants. A decentralized multi-LiDAR synchronization scheme is also devised to combine points from separate LiDARs into a single point cloud without the primary LiDAR assignment. Moreover, with the aim of improving the real-time performance of MLO without sacrificing robustness, a point cloud sampling strategy is designed with the consideration of localizability. To this end, CTE-MLO integrates synchronization, localizability-aware sampling, continuous-time estimation, and voxel map management within a Kalman filter framework, which can achieve high accuracy and robust continuous-time estimation within only a few linear iterations. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through various scenarios, including public datasets and real-world applications. The code is available at https://github.com/shenhm516/CTE-MLO to benefit the community.</p></details> |  |

LiDAR odometry systems are usually based on some form of point cloud registration to compute the ego-motion of a mobile robot. Yet, few of today's LiDAR odometry systems consider domain-specific knowledge or the kinematic model of the mobile platform during the point cloud alignment. In this paper, we present Kinematic-ICP, a LiDAR odometry system that focuses on wheeled mobile robots equipped with a 3D LiDAR and moving on a planar surface, which is a common assumption for warehouses, offices, hospitals, etc. Our approach introduces kinematic constraints within the optimization of a traditional point-to-point iterative closest point scheme. In this way, the resulting motion follows the kinematic constraints of the platform, effectively exploiting the robot's wheel odometry and the 3D LiDAR observations. We dynamically adjust the influence of LiDAR measurements and wheel odometry in our optimization scheme, allowing the system to handle degenerate scenarios such as feature-poor corridors. We evaluate our approach on robots operating in large-scale warehouse environments, but also outdoors. The experiments show that our approach achieves top performances and is more accurate than wheel odometry and common LiDAR odometry systems. Kinematic-ICP has been recently deployed in the Dexory fleet of robots operating in warehouses worldwide at their customers' sites, showing that our method can run in the real world alongside a complete navigation stack.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICRA 2025</p></details> |

In such scenarios, environmental sensing is essential for reliable operation. However, approaches such as LiDAR odometry and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) suffer from drift over long distances, especially in the absence of loop closures. Map-based localization offers a robust alternative, but the challenge lies in creating and georeferencing maps without GNSS support. To address this issue, we propose a method for creating georeferenced maps without GNSS by using publicly available data, such as building footprints and surface models derived from sparse aerial scans. Our approach integrates these data with onboard LiDAR scans to produce dense, accurate, georeferenced 3D point cloud maps. By combining an Iterative Closest Point (ICP) scan-to-scan and scan-to-map matching strategy, we achieve high local consistency without suffering from long-term drift. Thus, we eliminate the reliance on GNSS for the creation of georeferenced maps. The results demonstrate that LiDAR-only mapping can produce accurate georeferenced point cloud maps when augmented with existing map priors.</p></details> |  |

This area encompasses open grassy areas, paved pathways, and densely vegetated sections with trees and other objects. The dataset was recorded using a 128-beam LiDAR sensor and GPS and IMU readings to track the ego-vehicle. This paper evaluates the performance of two state-of-the-art LiDARinertial odometry frameworks, COIN-LIO and LIO-SAM, on this dataset. We analyse trajectory estimates in both horizontal and vertical dimensions and assess relative translation and yaw errors over varying distances. Our findings reveal that while both frameworks perform adequately in the vertical plane, COINLIO demonstrates superior accuracy in the horizontal plane, particularly over extended trajectories. In contrast, LIO-SAM shows increased drift and yaw errors over longer distances.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 2...</summary><p>The 2024 Australasian Conference on Robotics and Automation (ACRA 2024)</p></details> |

One key contribution of this work to 3D LiDAR SLAM and localization is a fierce defense of view-based maps (pose graphs with time-stamped sensor readings) as the fundamental representation of maps. As will be shown, they allow for the greatest flexibility, enabling the posterior generation of arbitrary metric maps optimized for particular tasks, e.g. obstacle avoidance, real-time localization. Moreover, this work introduces a new framework in which mapping pipelines can be defined without coding, defining the connections of a network of reusable blocks much like deep-learning networks are designed by connecting layers of standardized elements. We also introduce tightly-coupled estimation of linear and angular velocity vectors within the Iterative Closest Point (ICP)-like optimizer, leading to superior robustness against aggressive motion profiles without the need for an IMU. Extensive experimental validation reveals that the proposal compares well to, or improves, former state-of-the-art (SOTA) LiDAR odometry systems, while also successfully mapping some hard sequences where others diverge. A proposed self-adaptive configuration has been used, without parameter changes, for all 3D LiDAR datasets with sensors between 16 and 128 rings, and has been extensively tested on 83 sequences over more than 250~km of automotive, hand-held, airborne, and quadruped LiDAR datasets, both indoors and outdoors. The system flexibility is demonstrated with additional configurations for 2D LiDARs and for building 3D NDT-like maps.

Motorized LiDAR systems can expand the Field of View (FoV) without adding multiple scanners, but existing motorized LiDAR systems often rely on constant-speed motor control, leading to suboptimal performance in complex environments. To address this, we propose UA-MPC, an uncertainty-aware motor control strategy that balances scanning accuracy and efficiency. By predicting discrete observabilities of LiDAR Odometry (LO) through ray tracing and modeling their distribution with a surrogate function, UA-MPC efficiently optimizes motor speed control according to different scenes. Additionally, we develop a ROS-based realistic simulation environment for motorized LiDAR systems, enabling the evaluation of control strategies across diverse scenarios. Extensive experiments, conducted on both simulated and real-world scenarios, demonstrate that our method significantly improves odometry accuracy while preserving the scanning efficiency of motorized LiDAR systems. Specifically, it achieves over a 60\% reduction in positioning error with less than a 2\% decrease in efficiency compared to constant-speed control, offering a smarter and more effective solution for active 3D sensing tasks.

| **[A Real-time Degeneracy Sensing and Compensation Method for Enhanced LiDAR SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07513v1)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR is widely used in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and autonomous driving. The LiDAR odometry is of great importance in multi-sensor fusion. However, in some unstructured environments, the point cloud registration cannot constrain the poses of the LiDAR due to its sparse geometric features, which leads to the degeneracy of multi-sensor fusion accuracy. To address this problem, we propose a novel real-time approach to sense and compensate for the degeneracy of LiDAR. Firstly, this paper introduces the degeneracy factor with clear meaning, which can measure the degeneracy of LiDAR. Then, the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) clustering method adaptively perceives the degeneracy with better environmental generalization. Finally, the degeneracy perception results are utilized to fuse LiDAR and IMU, thus effectively resisting degeneracy effects. Experiments on our dataset show the method's high accuracy and robustness and validate our algorithm's adaptability to different environments and LiDAR scanning modalities.</p></details> | 13 pages |

However, unlike urban environments, agricultural fields impose distinct and unique challenges on autonomous robotic systems, such as the unstructured and dynamic nature of the environment, the rough and uneven terrain, and the resulting non-smooth robot motion. To address these challenges, this work introduces an adaptive LiDAR odometry and mapping framework tailored for autonomous agricultural mobile robots operating in complex agricultural environments. The proposed framework consists of a robust LiDAR odometry algorithm based on dense Generalized-ICP scan matching, and an adaptive mapping module that considers motion stability and point cloud consistency for selective map updates. The key design principle of this framework is to prioritize the incremental consistency of the map by rejecting motion-distorted points and sparse dynamic objects, which in turn leads to high accuracy in odometry estimated from scan matching against the map. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated via extensive evaluation against state-of-the-art methods on field datasets collected in real-world agricultural environments featuring various planting types, terrain types, and robot motion profiles. Results demonstrate that our method can achieve accurate odometry estimation and mapping results consistently and robustly across diverse agricultural settings, whereas other methods are sensitive to abrupt robot motion and accumulated drift in unstructured environments. Further, the computational efficiency of our method is competitive compared with other methods.

However, UAVs heavily rely on global navigation satellite system (GNSS) for localization which works well in open spaces, but the precision drastically degrades in the vicinity of buildings. These inaccuracies hinder aggregation of diverse data from multiple sources in a unified georeferenced frame for SAR operators. In contrast, CityGML models provide approximate building shapes with accurate georeferenced poses. Besides, LiDAR works best in the vicinity of 3D structures. Hence, we refine coarse GNSS measurements by registering LiDAR maps against CityGML and digital elevation map (DEM) models as a prior for allocentric mapping. An intuitive plausibility score selects the best hypothesis based on occupancy using a 2D height map. Afterwards, we integrate the registration results in a continuous-time spline-based pose graph optimizer with LiDAR odometry and further sensing modalities to obtain globally consistent, georeferenced trajectories and maps. We evaluate the viability of our approach on multiple flights captured at two distinct testing sites. Our method successfully reduced GNSS offset errors from up-to 16 m to below 0.5 m on multiple flights. Furthermore, we obtain globally consistent maps w.r.t. prior 3D geospatial models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at IEEE International Symposium on Safety, Security, and Rescue Robotics (SSRR), New York City, USA, November 2024</p></details> |

Existing approaches to dynamic object detection often rely on pretrained learned networks or computationally expensive volumetric maps. To enhance efficiency on computationally limited robots, we reuse data between the odometry and detection module. Utilizing a range image segmentation technique and a novel residual-based heuristic, our method distinguishes dynamic from static objects before integrating them into the point cloud map. The approach demonstrates robust object tracking and improved map accuracy in environments with numerous dynamic objects. Even highly non-rigid objects, such as running humans, are accurately detected at point level without prior downsampling of the point cloud and hence, without loss of information. Evaluation on simulated and real-world data validates its computational efficiency. Compared to a state-of-the-art volumetric method, our approach shows comparable detection performance at a fraction of the processing time, adding only 14 ms to the odometry module for dynamic object detection and tracking. The implementation and a new real-world dataset are available as open-source for further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 2024 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)</p></details> |

However, the performance of LiDAR odometry varies depending on the environment and deteriorates in degenerative environments such as long corridors. This issue stems from the dependence on a single error metric, which has different strengths and weaknesses depending on the geometrical characteristics of the surroundings. To address these problems, this study proposes a novel iterative closest point (ICP) method called GenZ-ICP. We revisited both point-to-plane and point-to-point error metrics and propose a method that leverages their strengths in a complementary manner. Moreover, adaptability to diverse environments was enhanced by utilizing an adaptive weight that is adjusted based on the geometrical characteristics of the surroundings. As demonstrated in our experimental evaluation, the proposed GenZ-ICP exhibits high adaptability to various environments and resilience to optimization degradation in corridor-like degenerative scenarios by preventing ill-posed problems during the optimization process.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, Accepted to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)</p></details> |

However, fusing these two modalities typically requires a highly accurate calibration between them. In this paper, we propose MDPCalib which is a novel method for camera-LiDAR calibration that requires neither human supervision nor any specific target objects. Instead, we utilize sensor motion estimates from visual and LiDAR odometry as well as deep learning-based 2D-pixel-to-3D-point correspondences that are obtained without in-domain retraining. We represent camera-LiDAR calibration as an optimization problem and minimize the costs induced by constraints from sensor motion and point correspondences. In extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our approach yields highly accurate extrinsic calibration parameters and is robust to random initialization. Additionally, our approach generalizes to a wide range of sensor setups, which we demonstrate by employing it on various robotic platforms including a self-driving perception car, a quadruped robot, and a UAV. To make our calibration method publicly accessible, we release the code on our project website at http://calibration.cs.uni-freiburg.de.</p></details> |  |

Particularly under conditions where the exteroceptive sensors, which the navigation depends on, can be degraded by environmental challenges thus, leading to mission failure. It is precisely in such challenges where the potential for FMCW radar sensors is highlighted: as a complementary exteroceptive sensing modality with direct velocity measuring capabilities. In this work we integrate radial speed measurements from a FMCW radar sensor, using a radial speed factor, to provide linear velocity updates into a sliding-window state estimator for fusion with LiDAR pose and IMU measurements. We demonstrate that this augmentation increases the robustness of the state estimator to challenging conditions present in the environment and the negative effects they can pose to vulnerable exteroceptive modalities. The proposed method is extensively evaluated using robotic field experiments conducted using an autonomous, full-scale, off-road vehicle operating at high-speeds (~12 m/s) in complex desert environments. Furthermore, the robustness of the approach is demonstrated for cases of both simulated and real-world degradation of the LiDAR odometry performance along with comparison against state-of-the-art methods for radar-inertial odometry on public datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 9 figures.

| **[Robust Loop Closure by Textual Cues in Challenging Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15869v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Loop closure is an important task in robot navigation. However, existing methods mostly rely on some implicit or heuristic features of the environment, which can still fail to work in common environments such as corridors, tunnels, and warehouses. Indeed, navigating in such featureless, degenerative, and repetitive (FDR) environments would also pose a significant challenge even for humans, but explicit text cues in the surroundings often provide the best assistance. This inspires us to propose a multi-modal loop closure method based on explicit human-readable textual cues in FDR environments. Specifically, our approach first extracts scene text entities based on Optical Character Recognition (OCR), then creates a local map of text cues based on accurate LiDAR odometry and finally identifies loop closure events by a graph-theoretic scheme. Experiment results demonstrate that this approach has superior performance over existing methods that rely solely on visual and LiDAR sensors.

Existing distortion correction solutions often struggle to balance computational complexity and accuracy. In this work, we propose an Adaptive Temporal Interval-based Continuous-Time LiDAR-only Odometry, utilizing straightforward and efficient linear interpolation. Our method flexibly adjusts the temporal intervals between control nodes according to the dynamics of motion and environmental characteristics. This adaptability enhances performance across various motion states and improves robustness in challenging, feature-sparse environments. We validate the effectiveness of our method on multiple datasets across different platforms, achieving accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art LiDAR-only odometry methods. Notably, in scenarios involving aggressive motion and sparse features, our method outperforms existing solutions.</p></details> |  |

To accomplish this, the features derived from the point cloud, including edges, surfaces, and Stable Triangle Descriptor (STD), along with the optimization problem, are expressed in the dual quaternion set. This approach enables the direct combination of translation and orientation errors via dual quaternion operations, greatly enhancing pose estimation, as demonstrated in comparative experiments against other state-of-the-art methods. Our approach reduced drift error compared to other LiDAR-only-odometry methods, especially in scenarios with sharp curves and aggressive movements with large angular displacement. DualQuat-LOAM is benchmarked against several public datasets. In the KITTI dataset it has a translation and rotation error of 0.79% and 0.0039{\deg}/m, with an average run time of 53 ms.</p></details> |  |
| **[TRLO: An Efficient LiDAR Odometry with 3D Dynamic Object Tracking and Removal](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13240v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simultaneous state estimation and mapping is an essential capability for mobile robots working in dynamic urban environment. The majority of existing SLAM solutions heavily rely on a primarily static assumption. However, due to the presence of moving vehicles and pedestrians, this assumption does not always hold, leading to localization accuracy decreased and maps distorted. To address this challenge, we propose TRLO, a dynamic LiDAR odometry that efficiently improves the accuracy of state estimation and generates a cleaner point cloud map. To efficiently detect dynamic objects in the surrounding environment, a deep learning-based method is applied, generating detection bounding boxes. We then design a 3D multi-object tracker based on Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) and nearest neighbor (NN) strategy to reliably identify and remove dynamic objects. Subsequently, a fast two-stage iterative nearest point solver is employed to solve the state estimation using cleaned static point cloud. Note that a novel hash-based keyframe database management is proposed for fast access to search keyframes. Furthermore, all the detected object bounding boxes are leveraged to impose posture consistency constraint to further refine the final state estimation. Extensive evaluations and ablation studies conducted on the KITTI and UrbanLoco datasets demonstrate that our approach not only achieves more accurate state estimation but also generates cleaner maps, compared with baselines.</p></details> | 8pages, 5figures |
| **[C$^3$P-VoxelMap: Compact, Cumulative and Coalescible Probabilistic Voxel Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01195v2)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work presents a compact, cumulative and coalescible probabilistic voxel mapping method to enhance performance, accuracy and memory efficiency in LiDAR odometry. Probabilistic voxel mapping requires storing past point clouds and re-iterating on them to update the uncertainty every iteration, which consumes large memory space and CPU cycles. To solve this problem, we propose a two-folded strategy. First, we introduce a compact point-free representation for probabilistic voxels and derive a cumulative update of the planar uncertainty without caching original point clouds. Our voxel structure only keeps track of a predetermined set of statistics for points that lie inside it. This method reduces the runtime complexity from $O(MN)$ to $O(N)$ and the space complexity from $O(N)$ to $O(1)$ where $M$ is the number of iterations and $N$ is the number of points. Second, to further minimize memory usage and enhance mapping accuracy, we provide a strategy to dynamically merge voxels associated with the same physical planes by taking advantage of the geometric features in the real world. Rather than scanning for these coalescible voxels constantly at every iteration, our merging strategy accumulates voxels in a locality-sensitive hash and triggers merging lazily. On-demand merging not only reduces memory footprint with minimal computational overhead but also improves localization accuracy thanks to cross-voxel denoising. Experiments exhibit 20% higher accuracy, 20% faster performance and 70% lower memory consumption than the state-of-the-art.</p></details> |  |

Current SLAM systems can achieve centimeter-level accuracy within a short period. However, there are still several challenges when dealing with largescale mapping tasks including significant storage requirements and difficulty of reusing the constructed maps. To address this, we first design an elastic and lightweight map representation called CELLmap, composed of several CELLs, each representing the local map at the corresponding location. Then, we design a general backend including CELL-based bidirectional registration module and loop closure detection module to improve global map consistency. Our experiments have demonstrated that CELLmap can represent the precise geometric structure of large-scale maps of KITTI dataset using only about 60 MB. Additionally, our general backend achieves up to a 26.88% improvement over various LiDAR odometry methods.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |

These improvements include enhanced resolution of point clouds and the capability to provide 360{\deg} low-resolution images. These images encode various data such as depth, reflectivity, and near-infrared light within the pixels. However, an excessive density of points and conventional point cloud sampling can be counterproductive, particularly in applications such as LiDAR odometry, where misleading points and degraded geometry information may induce drift errors. Currently, extensive research efforts are being directed towards leveraging LiDAR-generated images to improve situational awareness. This paper presents a comprehensive review of current deep learning (DL) techniques, including colorization and super-resolution, which are traditionally utilized in conventional computer vision tasks. These techniques are applied to LiDAR-generated images and are analyzed qualitatively. Based on this analysis, we have developed a novel approach that selectively integrates the most suited colorization and super-resolution methods with LiDAR imagery to sample reliable points from the LiDAR point cloud. This approach aims to not only improve the accuracy of point cloud registration but also avoid mismatching caused by lacking geometry information, thereby augmenting the utility and precision of LiDAR systems in practical applications. In our evaluation, the proposed approach demonstrates superior performance compared to our previous work, achieving lower translation and rotation errors with a reduced number of points.</p></details> | 9 pages |

First, an adaptive submap joining strategy is employed to generate prior submaps (keyframes and poses) for the central session, and to provide priors for subsidiaries when constraints are needed for robust localization. Next, a coarse-to-fine pose initialization for subsidiary sessions is performed using vertical recognition and ICP refinement in the global coordinate frame. To elevate the accuracy of subsequent localization, we propose an egocentric factor graph (EFG) module that integrates the IMU preintegration, LiDAR odometry and scan match factors in a joint optimization manner. Specifically, the scan match factors are constructed by a novel propagation model that efficiently distributes the prior constrains as edges to the relevant prior pose nodes, weighted by noises based on keyframe registration errors. Additionally, the framework supports flexible switching between two modes: relocalization (RLM) and incremental localization (ILM) based on the proposed overlap-based mechanism to select or update the prior submaps from central session. The proposed LiLoc is tested on public and custom datasets, demonstrating accurate localization performance against state-of-the-art methods.

It consists of a pyramid structure with a spatial information reuse strategy, a sequential pose initialization module, a gated hierarchical pose refinement module, and a temporal feature propagation module. First, spatial features are encoded using a point feature pyramid, with features reused in successive pose estimations to reduce computational overhead. Second, a sequential pose initialization method is introduced, leveraging the high-frequency sampling characteristic of LiDAR to initialize the LiDAR pose. Then, a gated hierarchical pose refinement mechanism refines poses from coarse to fine by selectively retaining or discarding motion information from different layers based on gate estimations. Finally, temporal feature propagation is proposed to incorporate the historical motion information from point cloud sequences, and address the spatial inconsistency issue when transmitting motion information embedded in point clouds between frames. Experimental results on the KITTI odometry dataset and Argoverse dataset demonstrate that DSLO outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving at least a 15.67\% improvement on RTE and a 12.64\% improvement on RRE, while also achieving a 34.69\% reduction in runtime compared to baseline methods.

Mesh maps represent a dense and continuous map format with low memory consumption, which can approximate complex structures with simple elements, attracting significant attention of researchers in recent years. However, most implementations operate under a static environment assumption. In effect, moving objects cause ghosting, potentially degrading the quality of meshing. To address these issues, we propose a plug-and-play meshing module adapting to dynamic environments, which can easily integrate with various LiDAR odometry to generally improve the pose estimation accuracy of odometry. In our meshing module, a novel two-stage coarse-to-fine dynamic removal method is designed to effectively filter dynamic objects, generating consistent, accurate, and dense mesh maps. To our best know, this is the first mesh construction method with explicit dynamic removal. Additionally, conducive to Gaussian process in mesh construction, sliding window-based keyframe aggregation and adaptive downsampling strategies are used to ensure the uniformity of point cloud. We evaluate the localization and mapping accuracy on five publicly available datasets. Both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate the superiority of our method compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms.

Sensors are often corrupted in those complicated and large-scale environments. This paper introduces GNSS-FGO, an online and global trajectory estimator that fuses GNSS observations alongside multiple sensor measurements for robust vehicle localization. In GNSS-FGO, we fuse asynchronous sensor measurements into the graph with a continuous-time trajectory representation using Gaussian process regression. This enables querying states at arbitrary timestamps so that sensor observations are fused without requiring strict state and measurement synchronization. Thus, the proposed method presents a generalized factor graph for multi-sensor fusion. To evaluate and study different GNSS fusion strategies, we fuse GNSS measurements in loose and tight coupling with a speed sensor, IMU, and lidar-odometry. We employed datasets from measurement campaigns in Aachen, Duesseldorf, and Cologne in experimental studies and presented comprehensive discussions on sensor observations, smoother types, and hyperparameter tuning. Our results show that the proposed approach enables robust trajectory estimation in dense urban areas, where the classic multi-sensor fusion method fails due to sensor degradation. In a test sequence containing a 17km route through Aachen, the proposed method results in a mean 2D positioning error of 0.48m while fusing raw GNSS observations with lidar odometry in a tight coupling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the IEEE Transactions on Robotics</p></details> |

However, it remains challenging to explore effective visual-LiDAR fusion, mainly due to the intrinsic data structure inconsistency between two modalities: Image pixels are regular and dense, but LiDAR points are unordered and sparse. To address the problem, we propose a local-to-global fusion network (DVLO) with bi-directional structure alignment. To obtain locally fused features, we project points onto the image plane as cluster centers and cluster image pixels around each center. Image pixels are pre-organized as pseudo points for image-to-point structure alignment. Then, we convert points to pseudo images by cylindrical projection (point-to-image structure alignment) and perform adaptive global feature fusion between point features and local fused features. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on KITTI odometry and FlyingThings3D scene flow datasets compared to both single-modal and multi-modal methods.

Traditional methods for dynamic object detection rely on high accuracy odometry and maps to detect and track moving objects. However, these methods are not suitable for long-term operation in dynamic environments where the surrounding environment is constantly changing. In order to solve this problem, we propose a novel system for detecting and tracking dynamic objects in real-time using only LiDAR data. By emphasizing the extraction of low-frequency components from LiDAR data as feature points for foreground objects, our method significantly reduces the time required for object clustering and movement analysis. Additionally, we have developed a tracking approach that employs intensity-based ego-motion estimation along with a sliding window technique to assess object movements. This enables the precise identification of moving objects and enhances the system's resilience to odometry drift. Our experiments show that this system can detect and track dynamic objects in real-time with an average detection accuracy of 88.7\% and a recall rate of 89.1\%. Furthermore, our system demonstrates resilience against the prolonged drift typically associated with front-end only LiDAR odometry.

However, most of the current works focus on nonlinear optimization methods, and still existing many challenges in using the traditional Iterative Extended Kalman Filter (IEKF) framework to tackle the problem: IEKF only iterates over the observation equation, relying on a rough estimate of the initial state, which is insufficient to fully eliminate motion distortion in the input point cloud; the system process noise is difficult to be determined during state estimation of the complex motions; and the varying motion models across different sensor carriers. To address these issues, we propose the Dual-Iteration Extended Kalman Filter (I2EKF) and the LiDAR odometry based on I2EKF (I2EKF-LO). This approach not only iterates over the observation equation but also leverages state updates to iteratively mitigate motion distortion in LiDAR point clouds. Moreover, it dynamically adjusts process noise based on the confidence level of prior predictions during state estimation and establishes motion models for different sensor carriers to achieve accurate and efficient state estimation. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that I2EKF-LO achieves outstanding levels of accuracy and computational efficiency in the realm of LiDAR odometry. Additionally, to foster community development, our code is open-sourced.https://github.com/YWL0720/I2EKF-LO.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IROS 2024</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose a SLAM system for building globally consistent maps, called PIN-SLAM, that is based on an elastic and compact point-based implicit neural map representation. Taking range measurements as input, our approach alternates between incremental learning of the local implicit signed distance field and the pose estimation given the current local map using a correspondence-free, point-to-implicit model registration. Our implicit map is based on sparse optimizable neural points, which are inherently elastic and deformable with the global pose adjustment when closing a loop. Loops are also detected using the neural point features. Extensive experiments validate that PIN-SLAM is robust to various environments and versatile to different range sensors such as LiDAR and RGB-D cameras. PIN-SLAM achieves pose estimation accuracy better or on par with the state-of-the-art LiDAR odometry or SLAM systems and outperforms the recent neural implicit SLAM approaches while maintaining a more consistent, and highly compact implicit map that can be reconstructed as accurate and complete meshes. Finally, thanks to the voxel hashing for efficient neural points indexing and the fast implicit map-based registration without closest point association, PIN-SLAM can run at the sensor frame rate on a moderate GPU. Codes will be available at: https://github.com/PRBonn/PIN_SLAM.</p></details> | 20 pages |
| **[Attention-Guided Lidar Segmentation and Odometry Using Image-to-Point Cloud Saliency Transfer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14332v2)** | 2024-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR odometry estimation and 3D semantic segmentation are crucial for autonomous driving, which has achieved remarkable advances recently. However, these tasks are challenging due to the imbalance of points in different semantic categories for 3D semantic segmentation and the influence of dynamic objects for LiDAR odometry estimation, which increases the importance of using representative/salient landmarks as reference points for robust feature learning. To address these challenges, we propose a saliency-guided approach that leverages attention information to improve the performance of LiDAR odometry estimation and semantic segmentation models. Unlike in the image domain, only a few studies have addressed point cloud saliency information due to the lack of annotated training data. To alleviate this, we first present a universal framework to transfer saliency distribution knowledge from color images to point clouds, and use this to construct a pseudo-saliency dataset (i.e. FordSaliency) for point clouds. Then, we adopt point cloud-based backbones to learn saliency distribution from pseudo-saliency labels, which is followed by our proposed SalLiDAR module. SalLiDAR is a saliency-guided 3D semantic segmentation model that integrates saliency information to improve segmentation performance. Finally, we introduce SalLONet, a self-supervised saliency-guided LiDAR odometry network that uses the semantic and saliency predictions of SalLiDAR to achieve better odometry estimation. Our extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed SalLiDAR and SalLONet models achieve state-of-the-art performance against existing methods, highlighting the effectiveness of image-to-LiDAR saliency knowledge transfer.

Notably, existing calibration methods derive calibration parameters under the assumption that the methods require full motion in all axes. When IMU and LiDAR are mounted on a ground robot the motion of which is restricted to planar motion, existing calibration methods are likely to exhibit degraded performance. To address this issue, we present GRIL-Calib: a novel targetless Ground Robot IMU-LiDAR Calibration method. Our proposed method leverages ground information to compensate for the lack of unrestricted full motion. First, we propose LiDAR Odometry (LO) using ground plane residuals to enhance calibration accuracy. Second, we propose the Ground Plane Motion (GPM) constraint and incorporate it into the optimization for calibration, enabling the determination of full 6-DoF extrinsic parameters, including theoretically unobservable direction. Finally, unlike baseline methods, we formulate the calibration not as sequential two optimizations but as a single optimization (SO) problem, solving all calibration parameters simultaneously and improving accuracy. We validate our GRIL-Calib by applying it to various real-world datasets and comparing its performance with that of existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and robustness. Our code is available at https://github.com/Taeyoung96/GRIL-Calib.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |

This problem has been addressed by the community for more than two decades, and many effective solutions are available nowadays. Most of these systems implicitly rely on assumptions about the operating environment, the sensor used, and motion pattern. When these assumptions are violated, several well-known systems tend to perform poorly. This paper presents a LiDAR odometry system that can overcome these limitations and operate well under different operating conditions while achieving performance comparable with domain-specific methods. Our algorithm follows the well-known ICP paradigm that leverages a PCA-based kd-tree implementation that is used to extract structural information about the clouds being registered and to compute the minimization metric for the alignment. The drift is bound by managing the local map based on the estimated uncertainty of the tracked pose. To benefit the community, we release an open-source C++ anytime real-time implementation.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/rvp-group/mad-icp</p></details> |

However, existing methods can struggle when dealing with uninformative geometric structures in challenging scenarios. This paper presents RELEAD, a LiDAR-centric solution designed to address scan-matching degradation. Our method enables degeneracy-free point cloud registration by solving constrained ESIKF updates in the front end and incorporates multisensor constraints, even when dealing with outlier measurements, through graph optimization based on Graduated Non-Convexity (GNC). Additionally, we propose a robust Incremental Fixed Lag Smoother (rIFL) for efficient GNC-based optimization. RELEAD has undergone extensive evaluation in degenerate scenarios and has outperformed existing state-of-the-art LiDAR-Inertial odometry and LiDAR-Visual-Inertial odometry methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improved LiDAR Odometry and Mapping using Deep Semantic Segmentation and Novel Outliers Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03111v1)** | 2024-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Perception is a key element for enabling intelligent autonomous navigation. Understanding the semantics of the surrounding environment and accurate vehicle pose estimation are essential capabilities for autonomous vehicles, including self-driving cars and mobile robots that perform complex tasks. Fast moving platforms like self-driving cars impose a hard challenge for localization and mapping algorithms. In this work, we propose a novel framework for real-time LiDAR odometry and mapping based on LOAM architecture for fast moving platforms. Our framework utilizes semantic information produced by a deep learning model to improve point-to-line and point-to-plane matching between LiDAR scans and build a semantic map of the environment, leading to more accurate motion estimation using LiDAR data. We observe that including semantic information in the matching process introduces a new type of outlier matches to the process, where matching occur between different objects of the same semantic class. To this end, we propose a novel algorithm that explicitly identifies and discards potential outliers in the matching process. In our experiments, we study the effect of improving the matching process on the robustness of LiDAR odometry against high speed motion. Our experimental evaluations on KITTI dataset demonstrate that utilizing semantic information and rejecting outliers significantly enhance the robustness of LiDAR odometry and mapping when there are large gaps between scan acquisition poses, which is typical for fast moving platforms.</p></details> |  |

In the existing works, iterative closest point (ICP) is widely used since it is precise and efficient. Due to its non-convexity and its local iterative strategy, however, ICP-based method easily falls into local optima, which in turn calls for a precise initialization. In this paper, we propose CoFi, a Coarse-to-Fine ICP algorithm for LiDAR localization. Specifically, the proposed algorithm down-samples the input point sets under multiple voxel resolution, and gradually refines the transformation from the coarse point sets to the fine-grained point sets. In addition, we propose a map based LiDAR localization algorithm that extracts semantic feature points from the LiDAR frames and apply CoFi to estimate the pose on an efficient point cloud map. With the help of the Cylinder3D algorithm for LiDAR scan semantic segmentation, the proposed CoFi localization algorithm demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance on the KITTI odometry benchmark, with significant improvement over the literature.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revis...</summary><p>Revise to new article</p></details> |
| **[Adaptive Denoising-Enhanced LiDAR Odometry for Degeneration Resilience in Diverse Terrains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14641v2)** | 2024-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The flexibility of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms in various environments has consistently been a significant challenge. To address the issue of LiDAR odometry drift in high-noise settings, integrating clustering methods to filter out unstable features has become an effective module of SLAM frameworks. However, reducing the amount of point cloud data can lead to potential loss of information and possible degeneration. As a result, this research proposes a LiDAR odometry that can dynamically assess the point cloud's reliability. The algorithm aims to improve adaptability in diverse settings by selecting important feature points with sensitivity to the level of environmental degeneration. Firstly, a fast adaptive Euclidean clustering algorithm based on range image is proposed, which, combined with depth clustering, extracts the primary structural points of the environment defined as ambient skeleton points. Then, the environmental degeneration level is computed through the dense normal features of the skeleton points, and the point cloud cleaning is dynamically adjusted accordingly. The algorithm is validated on the KITTI benchmark and real environments, demonstrating higher accuracy and robustness in different environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Characterizing Perspective Error in Voxel-Based Lidar Scan Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13416v1)** | 2024-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper quantifies an error source that limits the accuracy of lidar scan matching, particularly for voxel-based methods. Lidar scan matching, which is used in dead reckoning (also known as lidar odometry) and mapping, computes the rotation and translation that best align a pair of point clouds. Perspective errors occur when a scene is viewed from different angles, with different surfaces becoming visible or occluded from each viewpoint. To explain perspective anomalies observed in data, this paper models perspective errors for two objects representative of urban landscapes: a cylindrical column and a dual-wall corner. For each object, we provide an analytical model of the perspective error for voxel-based lidar scan matching. We then analyze how perspective errors accumulate as a lidar-equipped vehicle moves past these objects.</p></details> |  |
| **[LinK3D: Linear Keypoints Representation for 3D LiDAR Point Cloud](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.05927v3)** | 2024-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Feature extraction and matching are the basic parts of many robotic vision tasks, such as 2D or 3D object detection, recognition, and registration. As is known, 2D feature extraction and matching have already achieved great success. Unfortunately, in the field of 3D, the current methods may fail to support the extensive application of 3D LiDAR sensors in robotic vision tasks due to their poor descriptiveness and inefficiency. To address this limitation, we propose a novel 3D feature representation method: Linear Keypoints representation for 3D LiDAR point cloud, called LinK3D. The novelty of LinK3D lies in that it fully considers the characteristics (such as the sparsity and complexity) of LiDAR point clouds and represents the keypoint with its robust neighbor keypoints, which provide strong constraints in the description of the keypoint. The proposed LinK3D has been evaluated on three public datasets, and the experimental results show that our method achieves great matching performance. More importantly, LinK3D also shows excellent real-time performance, faster than the sensor frame rate at 10 Hz of a typical rotating LiDAR sensor. LinK3D only takes an average of 30 milliseconds to extract features from the point cloud collected by a 64-beam LiDAR and takes merely about 20 milliseconds to match two LiDAR scans when executed on a computer with an Intel Core i7 processor. Moreover, our method can be extended to LiDAR odometry task, and shows good scalability. We release the implementation of our method at https://github.com/YungeCui/LinK3D.</p></details> |  |

The main goal of odometry is to predict the robot's motion and accurately determine its current location. Various sensors, such as wheel encoder, inertial measurement unit (IMU), camera, radar, and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), are used for odometry in robotics. LiDAR, in particular, has gained attention for its ability to provide rich three-dimensional (3D) data and immunity to light variations. This survey aims to examine advancements in LiDAR odometry thoroughly. We start by exploring LiDAR technology and then scrutinize LiDAR odometry works, categorizing them based on their sensor integration approaches. These approaches include methods relying solely on LiDAR, those combining LiDAR with IMU, strategies involving multiple LiDARs, and methods fusing LiDAR with other sensor modalities. In conclusion, we address existing challenges and outline potential future directions in LiDAR odometry. Additionally, we analyze public datasets and evaluation methods for LiDAR odometry. To our knowledge, this survey is the first comprehensive exploration of LiDAR odometry.</p></details> | 32 pages, 5 figures |

In this study, we propose a novel LiDAR odometry which effectively utilizes the overall exterior characteristics of environmental landmarks. The vehicle pose estimation is accomplished by means of two sequential pose estimation stages, namely, horizontal pose estimation and vertical pose estimation. To achieve effective landmark registration, a comprehensive index is proposed to evaluate the level of similarity between landmarks. This index takes into account two crucial aspects of landmarks, namely, dimension and shape in evaluating their similarity. To assess the performance of the proposed algorithm, we utilize the widely recognized KITTI dataset as well as experimental data collected by an unmanned ground vehicle platform. Both graphical and numerical results indicate that our algorithm outperforms leading LiDAR odometry solutions in terms of positioning accuracy.</p></details> |  |

They are usually sensitive to noise. To overcome these limitations, we propose a real-time mesh-based LiDAR odometry and mapping approach for large-scale scenes via implicit reconstruction and a parallel spatial-hashing scheme. To efficiently reconstruct triangular meshes, we suggest an incremental voxel meshing method that updates every scan by traversing each point once and compresses space via a scalable partition module. By taking advantage of rapid accessing triangular meshes at any time, we design point-to-mesh odometry with location and feature-based data association to estimate the poses between the incoming point clouds and the recovered triangular meshes. The experimental results on four datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach in generating accurate motion trajectories and environmental mesh maps.</p></details> |  |
| **[Versatile LiDAR-Inertial Odometry With SE (2) Constraints for Ground Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01584v1)** | 2023-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR SLAM has become one of the major localization systems for ground vehicles since LiDAR Odometry And Mapping (LOAM). Many extension works on LOAM mainly leverage one specific constraint to improve the performance, e.g., information from on-board sensors such as loop closure and inertial state; prior conditions such as ground level and motion dynamics. In many robotic applications, these conditions are often known partially, hence a SLAM system can be a comprehensive problem due to the existence of numerous constraints. Therefore, we can achieve a better SLAM result by fusing them properly. In this paper, we propose a hybrid LiDAR-inertial SLAM framework that leverages both the on-board perception system and prior information such as motion dynamics to improve localization performance. In particular, we consider the case for ground vehicles, which are commonly used for autonomous driving and warehouse logistics. We present a computationally efficient LiDAR-inertial odometry method that directly parameterizes ground vehicle poses on SE(2). The out-of-SE(2) motion perturbations are not neglected but incorporated into an integrated noise term of a novel SE(2)-constraints model. For odometric measurement processing, we propose a versatile, tightly coupled LiDAR-inertial odometry to achieve better pose estimation than traditional LiDAR odometry. Thorough experiments are performed to evaluate our proposed method's performance in different scenarios, including localization for both indoor and outdoor environments. The proposed method achieves superior performance in accuracy and robustness.</p></details> |  |

Existing low-bias LiDAR odometry methods are often computationally expensive. To address this problem, we present a lightweight LiDAR odometry method that converts unorganized point cloud data into a spherical range image (SRI) and filters out surface, edge, and ground features in the image plane. This substantially reduces computation time and the required features for odometry estimation in LOAM-based algorithms. Our odometry estimation method does not rely on global maps or loop closure algorithms, which further reduces computational costs. Experimental results generate a translation and rotation error of 0.86\% and 0.0036{\deg}/m on the KITTI dataset with an average runtime of 78ms. In addition, we tested the method with our data, obtaining an average closed-loop error of 0.8m and a runtime of 27ms over eight loops covering 3.5Km.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is under review at the journal "Autonomous Robots" (Springer)</p></details> |

However, there are several challenges for these new LiDAR sensors, including small field of view, severe motion distortions, and irregular patterns, which hinder them from being widely used in LiDAR odometry, practically. To tackle these problems, we present an effective continuous-time LiDAR odometry (ECTLO) method for the Risley-prism-based LiDARs with non-repetitive scanning patterns. A single range image covering historical points in LiDAR's small FoV is adopted for efficient map representation. To account for the noisy data from occlusions after map updating, a filter-based point-to-plane Gaussian Mixture Model is used for robust registration. Moreover, a LiDAR-only continuous-time motion model is employed to relieve the inevitable distortions. Extensive experiments have been conducted on various testbeds using the prism-based LiDARs with different scanning patterns, whose promising results demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures.

In this article, we propose a novel approach to improve the accuracy of visual localization using Structure from Motion (SfM) techniques. We highlight the limitations of global SfM, which suffers from high latency, and the challenges of local SfM, which requires large image databases for accurate reconstruction. To address these issues, we propose utilizing Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), as opposed to image databases, to cut down on the space required for storage. We suggest that sampling reference images around the prior query position can lead to further improvements. We evaluate the accuracy of our proposed method against ground truth obtained using LIDAR and Advanced Lidar Odometry and Mapping in Real-time (A-LOAM), and compare its storage usage against local SfM with COLMAP in the conducted experiments. Our proposed method achieves an accuracy of 0.068 meters compared to the ground truth, which is slightly lower than the most advanced method COLMAP, which has an accuracy of 0.022 meters. However, the size of the database required for COLMAP is 400 megabytes, whereas the size of our NeRF model is only 160 megabytes. Finally, we perform an ablation study to assess the impact of using reference images from the NeRF reconstruction.</p></details> |  |

Reliability and efficiency are the two most valued features for applying SLAM in robot applications. In this paper, we consider achieving a reliable LiDAR-based SLAM function in computation-limited platforms, such as quadrotor UAVs based on graph-based point cloud association. First, contrary to most works selecting salient features for point cloud registration, we propose a non-conspicuous feature selection strategy for reliability and robustness purposes. Then a two-stage correspondence selection method is used to register the point cloud, which includes a KD-tree-based coarse matching followed by a graph-based matching method that uses geometric consistency to vote out incorrect correspondences. Additionally, we propose an odometry approach where the weight optimizations are guided by vote results from the aforementioned geometric consistency graph. In this way, the optimization of LiDAR odometry rapidly converges and evaluates a fairly accurate transformation resulting in the back-end module efficiently finishing the mapping task. Finally, we evaluate our proposed framework on the KITTI odometry dataset and real-world environments. Experiments show that our SLAM system achieves a comparative level or higher level of accuracy with more balanced computation efficiency compared with the mainstream LiDAR-based SLAM solutions.</p></details> |  |

Existing learning-based 3D descriptors and keypoint detectors are either independent or loosely coupled, so they cannot fully adapt to each other. In this work, we propose a tightly coupled keypoint detector and descriptor (TCKDD) based on a multi-task fully convolutional network with a probabilistic detection loss. In particular, this self-supervised detection loss fully adapts the keypoint detector to any jointly learned descriptors and benefits the self-supervised learning of descriptors. Extensive experiments on both indoor and outdoor datasets show that our TCKDD achieves state-of-the-art performance in point cloud registration. Furthermore, we design a keypoint detector and descriptors-assisted LiDAR odometry and mapping framework (KDD-LOAM), whose real-time odometry relies on keypoint descriptor matching-based RANSAC. The sparse keypoints are further used for efficient scan-to-map registration and mapping. Experiments on KITTI dataset demonstrate that KDD-LOAM significantly surpasses LOAM and shows competitive performance in odometry.</p></details> |  |

Unlike the mainstreamed approaches that focus on improving the accuracy by the additional inertial sensors, this letter explores the capability of LiDAR-only odometry through a continuous-time perspective. Firstly, the measurements of LiDAR are regarded as streaming points continuously captured at high frequency. Secondly, the LiDAR movement is parameterized by a simple yet effective continuous-time trajectory. Therefore, our proposed Traj-LO approach tries to recover the spatial-temporal consistent movement of LiDAR by tightly coupling the geometric information from LiDAR points and kinematic constraints from trajectory smoothness. This framework is generalized for different kinds of LiDAR as well as multi-LiDAR systems. Extensive experiments on the public datasets demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of our proposed LiDAR-only approach, even in scenarios where the kinematic state exceeds the IMU's measuring range.

While a myriad of keypoint detectors and descriptors have been extensively studied in conventional camera images, the effectiveness of these techniques in the context of LiDAR-generated images, i.e. reflectivity and ranges images, has not been assessed. These images have gained attention due to their resilience in adverse conditions such as rain or fog. Additionally, they contain significant textural information that supplements the geometric information provided by LiDAR point clouds in the point cloud registration phase, especially when reliant solely on LiDAR sensors. This addresses the challenge of drift encountered in LiDAR Odometry (LO) within geometrically identical scenarios or where not all the raw point cloud is informative and may even be misleading. This paper aims to analyze the applicability of conventional image key point extractors and descriptors on LiDAR-generated images via a comprehensive quantitative investigation. Moreover, we propose a novel approach to enhance the robustness and reliability of LO. After extracting key points, we proceed to downsample the point cloud, subsequently integrating it into the point cloud registration phase for the purpose of odometry estimation. Our experiment demonstrates that the proposed approach has comparable accuracy but reduced computational overhead, higher odometry publishing rate, and even superior performance in scenarios prone to drift by using the raw point cloud. This, in turn, lays a foundation for subsequent investigations into the integration of LiDAR-generated images with LO.

In this paper, we propose onlineFGO, a novel time-centric graph-optimization-based localization method that fuses multiple sensor measurements with the continuous-time trajectory representation for vehicle localization tasks. We generalize the graph construction independent of any spatial sensor measurements by creating the states deterministically on time. As the trajectory representation in continuous-time enables querying states at arbitrary times, incoming sensor measurements can be factorized on the graph without requiring state alignment. We integrate different GNSS observations: pseudorange, deltarange, and time-differenced carrier phase (TDCP) to ensure global reference and fuse the relative motion from a LiDAR-odometry to improve the localization consistency while GNSS observations are not available. Experiments on general performance, effects of different factors, and hyper-parameter settings are conducted in a real-world measurement campaign in Aachen city that contains different urban scenarios. Our results show an average 2D error of 0.99m and consistent state estimation in urban scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>A maj...</summary><p>A major revision of this paper is available, which will be submitted to arXiv later</p></details> |
| **[A LiDAR-Inertial SLAM Tightly-Coupled with Dropout-Tolerant GNSS Fusion for Autonomous Mine Service Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11492v1)** | 2023-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-modal sensor integration has become a crucial prerequisite for the real-world navigation systems. Recent studies have reported successful deployment of such system in many fields. However, it is still challenging for navigation tasks in mine scenes due to satellite signal dropouts, degraded perception, and observation degeneracy. To solve this problem, we propose a LiDAR-inertial odometry method in this paper, utilizing both Kalman filter and graph optimization. The front-end consists of multiple parallel running LiDAR-inertial odometries, where the laser points, IMU, and wheel odometer information are tightly fused in an error-state Kalman filter. Instead of the commonly used feature points, we employ surface elements for registration. The back-end construct a pose graph and jointly optimize the pose estimation results from inertial, LiDAR odometry, and global navigation satellite system (GNSS). Since the vehicle has a long operation time inside the tunnel, the largely accumulated drift may be not fully by the GNSS measurements. We hereby leverage a loop closure based re-initialization process to achieve full alignment. In addition, the system robustness is improved through handling data loss, stream consistency, and estimation error. The experimental results show that our system has a good tolerance to the long-period degeneracy with the cooperation different LiDARs and surfel registration, achieving meter-level accuracy even for tens of minutes running during GNSS dropouts.</p></details> |  |

Though LiDAR sensor is known for its precise range measurement, the non-uniform and uncertain point sampling density induce structural inconsistencies. Hence, existing supervised and unsupervised point set registration methods fail to establish one-to-one matching correspondences between LiDAR frames. We introduce a novel deep learning-based real-time (approx. 35-40ms per frame) LO method that jointly learns accurate frame-to-frame correspondences and model's predictive uncertainty (PU) as evidence to safe-guard LO predictions. In this work, we propose (i) partial optimal transportation of LiDAR feature descriptor for robust LO estimation, (ii) joint learning of predictive uncertainty while learning odometry over driving sequences, and (iii) demonstrate how PU can serve as evidence for necessary pose-graph optimization when LO network is either under or over confident. We evaluate our method on KITTI dataset and show competitive performance, even superior generalization ability over recent state-of-the-art approaches.

| **[4DRVO-Net: Deep 4D Radar-Visual Odometry Using Multi-Modal and Multi-Scale Adaptive Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06573v1)** | 2023-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Four-dimensional (4D) radar--visual odometry (4DRVO) integrates complementary information from 4D radar and cameras, making it an attractive solution for achieving accurate and robust pose estimation. However, 4DRVO may exhibit significant tracking errors owing to three main factors: 1) sparsity of 4D radar point clouds; 2) inaccurate data association and insufficient feature interaction between the 4D radar and camera; and 3) disturbances caused by dynamic objects in the environment, affecting odometry estimation. In this paper, we present 4DRVO-Net, which is a method for 4D radar--visual odometry. This method leverages the feature pyramid, pose warping, and cost volume (PWC) network architecture to progressively estimate and refine poses. Specifically, we propose a multi-scale feature extraction network called Radar-PointNet++ that fully considers rich 4D radar point information, enabling fine-grained learning for sparse 4D radar point clouds. To effectively integrate the two modalities, we design an adaptive 4D radar--camera fusion module (A-RCFM) that automatically selects image features based on 4D radar point features, facilitating multi-scale cross-modal feature interaction and adaptive multi-modal feature fusion. In addition, we introduce a velocity-guided point-confidence estimation module to measure local motion patterns, reduce the influence of dynamic objects and outliers, and provide continuous updates during pose refinement. We demonstrate the excellent performance of our method and the effectiveness of each module design on both the VoD and in-house datasets. Our method outperforms all learning-based and geometry-based methods for most sequences in the VoD dataset. Furthermore, it has exhibited promising performance that closely approaches that of the 64-line LiDAR odometry results of A-LOAM without mapping optimization.</p></details> | 14 pages,12 figures |
| **[LiDAR View Synthesis for Robust Vehicle Navigation Without Expert Labels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01424v2)** | 2023-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models for self-driving cars require a diverse training dataset to manage critical driving scenarios on public roads safely. This includes having data from divergent trajectories, such as the oncoming traffic lane or sidewalks. Such data would be too dangerous to collect in the real world. Data augmentation approaches have been proposed to tackle this issue using RGB images. However, solutions based on LiDAR sensors are scarce. Therefore, we propose synthesizing additional LiDAR point clouds from novel viewpoints without physically driving at dangerous positions. The LiDAR view synthesis is done using mesh reconstruction and ray casting. We train a deep learning model, which takes a LiDAR scan as input and predicts the future trajectory as output. A waypoint controller is then applied to this predicted trajectory to determine the throttle and steering labels of the ego-vehicle. Our method neither requires expert driving labels for the original nor the synthesized LiDAR sequence. Instead, we infer labels from LiDAR odometry. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in a comprehensive online evaluation and with a comparison to concurrent work. Our results show the importance of synthesizing additional LiDAR point clouds, particularly in terms of model robustness. Project page: https://jonathsch.github.io/lidar-synthesis/</p></details> |  |
| **[3D-SeqMOS: A Novel Sequential 3D Moving Object Segmentation in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09044v1)** | 2023-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For the SLAM system in robotics and autonomous driving, the accuracy of front-end odometry and back-end loop-closure detection determine the whole intelligent system performance. But the LiDAR-SLAM could be disturbed by current scene moving objects, resulting in drift errors and even loop-closure failure. Thus, the ability to detect and segment moving objects is essential for high-precision positioning and building a consistent map. In this paper, we address the problem of moving object segmentation from 3D LiDAR scans to improve the odometry and loop-closure accuracy of SLAM. We propose a novel 3D Sequential Moving-Object-Segmentation (3D-SeqMOS) method that can accurately segment the scene into moving and static objects, such as moving and static cars. Different from the existing projected-image method, we process the raw 3D point cloud and build a 3D convolution neural network for MOS task. In addition, to make full use of the spatio-temporal information of point cloud, we propose a point cloud residual mechanism using the spatial features of current scan and the temporal features of previous residual scans. Besides, we build a complete SLAM framework to verify the effectiveness and accuracy of 3D-SeqMOS. Experiments on SemanticKITTI dataset show that our proposed 3D-SeqMOS method can effectively detect moving objects and improve the accuracy of LiDAR odometry and loop-closure detection. The test results show our 3D-SeqMOS outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 12.4%. We extend the proposed method to the SemanticKITTI: Moving Object Segmentation competition and achieve the 2nd in the leaderboard, showing its effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[High Resolution Point Clouds from mmWave Radar](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.09273v2)** | 2023-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper explores a machine learning approach for generating high resolution point clouds from a single-chip mmWave radar. Unlike lidar and vision-based systems, mmWave radar can operate in harsh environments and see through occlusions like smoke, fog, and dust. Unfortunately, current mmWave processing techniques offer poor spatial resolution compared to lidar point clouds. This paper presents RadarHD, an end-to-end neural network that constructs lidar-like point clouds from low resolution radar input. Enhancing radar images is challenging due to the presence of specular and spurious reflections. Radar data also doesn't map well to traditional image processing techniques due to the signal's sinc-like spreading pattern. We overcome these challenges by training RadarHD on a large volume of raw I/Q radar data paired with lidar point clouds across diverse indoor settings. Our experiments show the ability to generate rich point clouds even in scenes unobserved during training and in the presence of heavy smoke occlusion. Further, RadarHD's point clouds are high-quality enough to work with existing lidar odometry and mapping workflows.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spoofing-Resilient LiDAR-GPS Factor Graph Localization with Chimera Authentication](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04692v1)** | 2023-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many vehicle platforms typically use sensors such as LiDAR or camera for locally-referenced navigation with GPS for globally-referenced navigation. However, due to the unencrypted nature of GPS signals, all civilian users are vulner-able to spoofing attacks, where a malicious spoofer broadcasts fabricated signals and causes the user to track a false position fix. To protect against such GPS spoofing attacks, Chips-Message Robust Authentication (Chimera) has been developed and will be tested on the Navigation Technology Satellite 3 (NTS-3) satellite being launched later this year. However, Chimera authentication is not continuously available and may not provide sufficient protection for vehicles which rely on more frequent GPS measurements. In this paper, we propose a factor graph-based state estimation framework which integrates LiDAR and GPS while simultaneously detecting and mitigating spoofing attacks experienced between consecutive Chimera authentications. Our proposed framework combines GPS pseudorange measurements with LiDAR odometry to provide a robust navigation solution. A chi-squared detector, based on pseudorange residuals, is used to detect and mitigate any potential GPS spoofing attacks. We evaluate our method using real-world LiDAR data from the KITTI dataset and simulated GPS measurements, both nominal and with spoofing. Across multiple trajectories and Monte Carlo runs, our method consistently achieves position errors under 5 m during nominal conditions, and successfully bounds positioning error to within odometry drift levels during spoofed conditions.</p></details> |  |

The proposed method is based on two popular approaches, ORB-SLAM and A-LOAM, with monocular scale correction and visual-bootstrapped LiDAR poses initialization modifications. The scale corrector calculates the proportion between the depth of image keypoints recovered by triangulation and that provided by LiDAR, using an outlier rejection process for accuracy improvement. Concerning LiDAR poses initialization, the visual odometry approach gives the initial guesses of LiDAR motions for better performance. This methodology is not only applicable to high-resolution LiDAR but can also adapt to low-resolution LiDAR. To evaluate the proposed SLAM system's robustness and accuracy, we conducted experiments on the KITTI Odometry and S3E datasets. Experimental results illustrate that our method significantly outperforms standalone ORB-SLAM2 and A-LOAM. Furthermore, regarding the accuracy of visual odometry with scale correction, our method performs similarly to the stereo-mode ORB-SLAM2.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 7 figures, 32 references</p></details> |

The analyzed method uses these two parameters to calculate weights for Iterative Re-weighted Least Squares. This adaptive nature of the weights can be helpful in situations where the noise level varies in the measurements. We test our algorithm first on the point cloud registration problem with synthetic data sets and LiDAR odometry with open source real-world data sets. We show that the existing approach needs an additional manual tuning of a residual scale parameter which our method directly learns from data and has similar or better performance. We further present the idea of decoupling scale and shape parameters to improve performance of the algorithm. We give detailed analysis of our algorithm along with its comparison with similar well-known algorithms from literature to show the benefits of the proposed approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems</p></details> |

Inspired by the rodent hippocampus, this paper presents a biologically inspired SLAM system based on a LiDAR sensor using a hippocampal model to build a cognitive map and estimate the robot pose in indoor environments. Based on the biologically inspired models mimicking boundary cells, place cells, and head direction cells, the SLAM system using LiDAR point cloud data is capable of leveraging the self-motion cues from the LiDAR odometry and the boundary cues from the LiDAR boundary cells to build a cognitive map and estimate the robot pose. Experiment results show that with the LiDAR boundary cells the proposed SLAM system greatly outperforms the camera-based brain-inspired method in both simulation and indoor environments, and is competitive with the conventional LiDAR-based SLAM methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quadric Representations for LiDAR Odometry, Mapping and Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14190v1)** | 2023-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current LiDAR odometry, mapping and localization methods leverage point-wise representations of 3D scenes and achieve high accuracy in autonomous driving tasks. However, the space-inefficiency of methods that use point-wise representations limits their development and usage in practical applications. In particular, scan-submap matching and global map representation methods are restricted by the inefficiency of nearest neighbor searching (NNS) for large-volume point clouds. To improve space-time efficiency, we propose a novel method of describing scenes using quadric surfaces, which are far more compact representations of 3D objects than conventional point clouds. In contrast to point cloud-based methods, our quadric representation-based method decomposes a 3D scene into a collection of sparse quadric patches, which improves storage efficiency and avoids the slow point-wise NNS process. Our method first segments a given point cloud into patches and fits each of them to a quadric implicit function. Each function is then coupled with other geometric descriptors of the patch, such as its center position and covariance matrix. Collectively, these patch representations fully describe a 3D scene, which can be used in place of the original point cloud and employed in LiDAR odometry, mapping and localization algorithms. We further design a novel incremental growing method for quadric representations, which eliminates the need to repeatedly re-fit quadric surfaces from the original point cloud. Extensive odometry, mapping and localization experiments on large-volume point clouds in the KITTI and UrbanLoco datasets demonstrate that our method maintains low latency and memory utility while achieving competitive, and even superior, accuracy.</p></details> |  |

However, it faces many challenges in real-world scenarios, such as the prior information about the environment being absent and poor communication among the team members. This work presents DCL-SLAM, a fully distributed collaborative LiDAR SLAM framework intended for the robotic swarm to simultaneously co-localize in an unknown environment with minimal information exchange. Based on ad-hoc wireless peer-to-peer communication (limited bandwidth and communication range), DCL-SLAM adopts the lightweight LiDAR-Iris descriptor for place recognition and does not require full connectivity among teams. DCL-SLAM includes three main parts: a replaceable single-robot front-end that produces LiDAR odometry results; a distributed loop closure module that detects inter-robot loop closures with keyframes; and a distributed back-end module that adapts distributed pose graph optimizer combined with a pairwise consistent measurement set maximization algorithm to reject spurious inter-robot loop closures. We integrate our proposed framework with diverse open-source LiDAR odometry methods to show its versatility. The proposed system is extensively evaluated on benchmarking datasets and field experiments over various scales and environments. Experimental result shows that DCL-SLAM achieves higher accuracy and lower communication bandwidth than other state-of-art multi-robot SLAM systems.

The proposed RO has been tested on two public radar datasets: the Oxford Radar RobotCar dataset and the nuScenes dataset, which provide scanning and automotive radar data respectively. The results show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art RO using either automotive or scanning radar by reducing translational error by 51% and 30%, respectively, and rotational error by 17% and 29%, respectively.

The LRCN layer is a structure that can process spatial and temporal information at once by using both CNN and LSTM layers. This feature is suitable for predicting continuous robot movements as it uses point clouds that contain spatial information. Therefore, we built a LoRCoN-LO model using the LRCN layer, and predicted the pose of the robot through this model. For performance verification, we conducted experiments exploiting a public dataset (KITTI). The results of the experiment show that LoRCoN-LO displays accurate odometry prediction in the dataset.

| **[NeRF-LOAM: Neural Implicit Representation for Large-Scale Incremental LiDAR Odometry and Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10709v1)** | 2023-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simultaneously odometry and mapping using LiDAR data is an important task for mobile systems to achieve full autonomy in large-scale environments. However, most existing LiDAR-based methods prioritize tracking quality over reconstruction quality. Although the recently developed neural radiance fields (NeRF) have shown promising advances in implicit reconstruction for indoor environments, the problem of simultaneous odometry and mapping for large-scale scenarios using incremental LiDAR data remains unexplored. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose a novel NeRF-based LiDAR odometry and mapping approach, NeRF-LOAM, consisting of three modules neural odometry, neural mapping, and mesh reconstruction. All these modules utilize our proposed neural signed distance function, which separates LiDAR points into ground and non-ground points to reduce Z-axis drift, optimizes odometry and voxel embeddings concurrently, and in the end generates dense smooth mesh maps of the environment. Moreover, this joint optimization allows our NeRF-LOAM to be pre-trained free and exhibit strong generalization abilities when applied to different environments. Extensive evaluations on three publicly available datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art odometry and mapping performance, as well as a strong generalization in large-scale environments utilizing LiDAR data. Furthermore, we perform multiple ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of our network design. The implementation of our approach will be made available at https://github.com/JunyuanDeng/NeRF-LOAM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimized SC-F-LOAM: Optimized Fast LiDAR Odometry and Mapping Using Scan Context](http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.04932v2)** | 2023-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR odometry can achieve accurate vehicle pose estimation for short driving range or in small-scale environments, but for long driving range or in large-scale environments, the accuracy deteriorates as a result of cumulative estimation errors. This drawback necessitates the inclusion of loop closure detection in a SLAM framework to suppress the adverse effects of cumulative errors. To improve the accuracy of pose estimation, we propose a new LiDAR-based SLAM method which uses F-LOAM as LiDAR odometry, Scan Context for loop closure detection, and GTSAM for global optimization. In our approach, an adaptive distance threshold (instead of a fixed threshold) is employed for loop closure detection, which achieves more accurate loop closure detection results. Besides, a feature-based matching method is used in our approach to compute vehicle pose transformations between loop closure point cloud pairs, instead of using the raw point cloud obtained by the LiDAR sensor, which significantly reduces the computation time. The KITTI dataset is used for verifications of our method, and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms typical LiDAR odometry/SLAM methods in the literature. Our code is made publicly available for the benefit of the community.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semantic Geometric Fusion Multi-object Tracking and Lidar Odometry in Dynamic Environment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11621v5)** | 2023-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The SLAM system based on static scene assumption will introduce huge estimation errors when moving objects appear in the field of view. This paper proposes a novel multi-object dynamic lidar odometry (MLO) based on semantic object detection technology to solve this problem. The MLO system can provide reliable localization of robot and semantic objects and build long-term static maps in complex dynamic scenes. For ego-motion estimation, we use the environment features that take semantic and geometric consistency constraints into account in the extraction process. The filtering features are robust to semantic movable and unknown dynamic objects. At the same time, a least square estimator using the semantic bounding box and object point cloud is proposed to achieve accurate and stable multi-object tracking between frames. In the mapping module, we further realize dynamic semantic object detection based on the absolute trajectory tracking list (ATTL). Then, static semantic objects and environmental features can be used to eliminate accumulated localization errors and build pure static maps. Experiments on public KITTI data sets show that the proposed system can achieve more accurate and robust tracking of the object and better real-time localization accuracy in complex scenes compared with existing technologies.</p></details> |  |
| **[3D LiDAR Aided GNSS NLOS Mitigation for Reliable GNSS-RTK Positioning in Urban Canyons](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05477v1)** | 2022-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>GNSS and LiDAR odometry are complementary as they provide absolute and relative positioning, respectively. Their integration in a loosely-coupled manner is straightforward but is challenged in urban canyons due to the GNSS signal reflections. Recent proposed 3D LiDAR-aided (3DLA) GNSS methods employ the point cloud map to identify the non-line-of-sight (NLOS) reception of GNSS signals. This facilitates the GNSS receiver to obtain improved urban positioning but not achieve a sub-meter level. GNSS real-time kinematics (RTK) uses carrier phase measurements to obtain decimeter-level positioning. In urban areas, the GNSS RTK is not only challenged by multipath and NLOS-affected measurement but also suffers from signal blockage by the building. The latter will impose a challenge in solving the ambiguity within the carrier phase measurements. In the other words, the model observability of the ambiguity resolution (AR) is greatly decreased. This paper proposes to generate virtual satellite (VS) measurements using the selected LiDAR landmarks from the accumulated 3D point cloud maps (PCM). These LiDAR-PCM-made VS measurements are tightly-coupled with GNSS pseudorange and carrier phase measurements. Thus, the VS measurements can provide complementary constraints, meaning providing low-elevation-angle measurements in the across-street directions. The implementation is done using factor graph optimization to solve an accurate float solution of the ambiguity before it is fed into LAMBDA. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been validated by the evaluation conducted on our recently open-sourced challenging dataset, UrbanNav. The result shows the fix rate of the proposed 3DLA GNSS RTK is about 30% while the conventional GNSS-RTK only achieves about 14%. In addition, the proposed method achieves sub-meter positioning accuracy in most of the data collected in challenging urban areas.</p></details> |  |
| **[DL-SLOT: Dynamic LiDAR SLAM and object tracking based on collaborative graph optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02077v1)** | 2022-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ego-pose estimation and dynamic object tracking are two critical problems for autonomous driving systems. The solutions to these problems are generally based on their respective assumptions, \ie{the static world assumption for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and the accurate ego-pose assumption for object tracking}. However, these assumptions are challenging to hold in dynamic road scenarios, where SLAM and object tracking become closely correlated. Therefore, we propose DL-SLOT, a dynamic LiDAR SLAM and object tracking method, to simultaneously address these two coupled problems. This method integrates the state estimations of both the autonomous vehicle and the stationary and dynamic objects in the environment into a unified optimization framework. First, we used object detection to identify all points belonging to potentially dynamic objects. Subsequently, a LiDAR odometry was conducted using the filtered point cloud. Simultaneously, we proposed a sliding window-based object association method that accurately associates objects according to the historical trajectories of tracked objects. The ego-states and those of the stationary and dynamic objects are integrated into the sliding window-based collaborative graph optimization. The stationary objects are subsequently restored from the potentially dynamic object set. Finally, a global pose-graph is implemented to eliminate the accumulated error. Experiments on KITTI datasets demonstrate that our method achieves better accuracy than SLAM and object tracking baseline methods. This confirms that solving SLAM and object tracking simultaneously is mutually advantageous, dramatically improving the robustness and accuracy of SLAM and object tracking in dynamic road scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 10 figures, this work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

For quadrupeds to navigate without a predefined map a priori, they must rely on SLAM approaches to localize and build the map of the environment. Despite the surge of interest and research development in SLAM and quadrupeds, there still has yet to be an open-source package that capitalizes on the onboard sensors of an affordable quadruped. This motivates the A1 SLAM package, which is an open-source ROS package that provides the Unitree A1 quadruped with real-time, high performing SLAM capabilities using the default sensors shipped with the robot. A1 SLAM solves the PoseSLAM problem using the factor graph paradigm to optimize for the poses throughout the trajectory.

| **[BoW3D: Bag of Words for Real-Time Loop Closing in 3D LiDAR SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07473v2)** | 2022-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Loop closing is a fundamental part of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) for autonomous mobile systems. In the field of visual SLAM, bag of words (BoW) has achieved great success in loop closure. The BoW features for loop searching can also be used in the subsequent 6-DoF loop correction. However, for 3D LiDAR SLAM, the state-of-the-art methods may fail to effectively recognize the loop in real time, and usually cannot correct the full 6-DoF loop pose. To address this limitation, we present a novel Bag of Words for real-time loop closing in 3D LiDAR SLAM, called BoW3D. Our method not only efficiently recognizes the revisited loop places, but also corrects the full 6-DoF loop pose in real time. BoW3D builds the bag of words based on the 3D LiDAR feature LinK3D, which is efficient, pose-invariant and can be used for accurate point-to-point matching. We furthermore embed our proposed method into 3D LiDAR odometry system to evaluate loop closing performance.

Our proposed method is generalized in that it can seamlessly fuse various local geometric shapes around points to improve the position estimation accuracy compared to the conventional LiDAR odometry and mapping (LOAM) method. To utilize continuous geometric features for LiDAR odometry estimation, we incorporate tiny neural networks into a generalized iterative closest point (GICP) algorithm. These neural networks improve the data association metric and the matching cost function using local geometric features. Experiments with the KITTI benchmark demonstrate that our proposed method reduces relative trajectory errors compared to the other LiDAR odometry estimation methods.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |
| **[WGICP: Differentiable Weighted GICP-Based Lidar Odometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09777v2)** | 2022-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel differentiable weighted generalized iterative closest point (WGICP) method applicable to general 3D point cloud data, including that from Lidar. Our method builds on differentiable generalized ICP (GICP), and we propose using the differentiable K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm to enhance differentiability. The differentiable GICP algorithm provides the gradient of output pose estimation with respect to each input point, which allows us to train a neural network to predict its importance, or weight, in estimating the correct pose. In contrast to the other ICP-based methods that use voxel-based downsampling or matching methods to reduce the computational cost, our method directly reduces the number of points used for GICP by only selecting those with the highest weights and ignoring redundant ones with lower weights. We show that our method improves both accuracy and speed of the GICP algorithm for the KITTI dataset and can be used to develop a more robust and efficient SLAM system.</p></details> | 6 pages |

The existing line of studies mostly focuses on one pass undistortion, which means undistortion for each point is conducted only once in the whole LiDAR-IMU odometry pipeline. In this paper, we propose an optimization based tightly coupled LiDAR-IMU odometry addressing iterated point-level undistortion. By jointly minimizing the cost derived from LiDAR and IMU measurements, our LiDAR-IMU odometry method performs more accurate and robust in high dynamic environment. Besides, the method characters good computation efficiency by limiting the quantity of parameters.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present a global descriptor, named Normal Distribution Descriptor (NDD), for 3D point cloud loop closure detection. The descriptor encodes both the probability density score and entropy of a point cloud as the descriptor. We also propose a fast rotation alignment process and use correlation coefficient as the similarity between descriptors. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art point cloud descriptors in both accuracy and efficency.

| **[LMBAO: A Landmark Map for Bundle Adjustment Odometry in LiDAR SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08810v1)** | 2022-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR odometry is one of the essential parts of LiDAR simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). However, existing LiDAR odometry tends to match a new scan simply iteratively with previous fixed-pose scans, gradually accumulating errors. Furthermore, as an effective joint optimization mechanism, bundle adjustment (BA) cannot be directly introduced into real-time odometry due to the intensive computation of large-scale global landmarks. Therefore, this letter designs a new strategy named a landmark map for bundle adjustment odometry (LMBAO) in LiDAR SLAM to solve these problems. First, BA-based odometry is further developed with an active landmark maintenance strategy for a more accurate local registration and avoiding cumulative errors. Specifically, this paper keeps entire stable landmarks on the map instead of just their feature points in the sliding window and deletes the landmarks according to their active grade. Next, the sliding window length is reduced, and marginalization is performed to retain the scans outside the window but corresponding to active landmarks on the map, greatly simplifying the computation and improving the real-time properties. In addition, experiments on three challenging datasets show that our algorithm achieves real-time performance in outdoor driving and outperforms state-of-the-art LiDAR SLAM algorithms, including Lego-LOAM and VLOM.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 tables, 6 figures</p></details> |

In this architecture, the projection-aware representation of the 3D point cloud is proposed to organize the raw 3D point cloud into an ordered data form to achieve efficiency. The Pyramid, Warping, and Cost volume (PWC) structure for the LiDAR odometry task is built to estimate and refine the pose in a coarse-to-fine approach. A projection-aware attentive cost volume is built to directly associate two discrete point clouds and obtain embedding motion patterns. Then, a trainable embedding mask is proposed to weigh the local motion patterns to regress the overall pose and filter outlier points. The trainable pose warp-refinement module is iteratively used with embedding mask optimized hierarchically to make the pose estimation more robust for outliers. The entire architecture is holistically optimized end-to-end to achieve adaptive learning of cost volume and mask, and all operations involving point cloud sampling and grouping are accelerated by projection-aware 3D feature learning methods. The superior performance and effectiveness of our LiDAR odometry architecture are demonstrated on KITTI, M2DGR, and Argoverse datasets. Our method outperforms all recent learning-based methods and even the geometry-based approach, LOAM with mapping optimization, on most sequences of KITTI odometry dataset.

Poor synchronization performance, due to incorrect timestamping procedure, may negatively affect the algorithms' state estimation results. To provide highly accurate and precise synchronization between the sensors, we introduce an open-source hardware-software LiDAR to other sensors time synchronization system that exploits a dedicated hardware LiDAR time synchronization interface by providing emulated GNSS-clock to this interface, no physical GNSS-receiver is needed. The emulator is based on a general-purpose microcontroller and, due to concise hardware and software architecture, can be easily modified or extended for synchronization of sets of different sensors such as cameras, inertial measurement units (IMUs), wheel encoders, other LiDARs, etc. In the paper, we provide an example of such a system with synchronized LiDAR and IMU sensors. We conducted an evaluation of the sensors synchronization accuracy and precision, and state 1 microsecond performance. We compared our results with timestamping provided by ROS software and by a LiDAR inner clocking scheme to underline clear advantages over these two baseline methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE ISPCS 2022 Conference (International Symposium on Precision Clock Synchronization for Measurement, Control and Communication)</p></details> |
| **[InTEn-LOAM: Intensity and Temporal Enhanced LiDAR Odometry and Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05708v1)** | 2022-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional LiDAR odometry (LO) systems mainly leverage geometric information obtained from the traversed surroundings to register laser scans and estimate LiDAR ego-motion, while it may be unreliable in dynamic or unstructured environments. This paper proposes InTEn-LOAM, a low-drift and robust LiDAR odometry and mapping method that fully exploits implicit information of laser sweeps (i.e., geometric, intensity, and temporal characteristics). Scanned points are projected to cylindrical images, which facilitate the efficient and adaptive extraction of various types of features, i.e., ground, beam, facade, and reflector. We propose a novel intensity-based points registration algorithm and incorporate it into the LiDAR odometry, enabling the LO system to jointly estimate the LiDAR ego-motion using both geometric and intensity feature points. To eliminate the interference of dynamic objects, we propose a temporal-based dynamic object removal approach to filter them out before map update. Moreover, the local map is organized and downsampled using a temporal-related voxel grid filter to maintain the similarity between the current scan and the static local map. Extensive experiments are conducted on both simulated and real-world datasets. The results show that the proposed method achieves similar or better accuracy w.r.t the state-of-the-arts in normal driving scenarios and outperforms geometric-based LO in unstructured environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pseudo-LiDAR for Visual Odometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01567v1)** | 2022-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the existing methods, LiDAR odometry shows superior performance, but visual odometry is still widely used for its price advantage. Conventionally, the task of visual odometry mainly rely on the input of continuous images. However, it is very complicated for the odometry network to learn the epipolar geometry information provided by the images. In this paper, the concept of pseudo-LiDAR is introduced into the odometry to solve this problem. The pseudo-LiDAR point cloud back-projects the depth map generated by the image into the 3D point cloud, which changes the way of image representation. Compared with the stereo images, the pseudo-LiDAR point cloud generated by the stereo matching network can get the explicit 3D coordinates. Since the 6 Degrees of Freedom (DoF) pose transformation occurs in 3D space, the 3D structure information provided by the pseudo-LiDAR point cloud is more direct than the image. Compared with sparse LiDAR, the pseudo-LiDAR has a denser point cloud. In order to make full use of the rich point cloud information provided by the pseudo-LiDAR, a projection-aware dense odometry pipeline is adopted. Most previous LiDAR-based algorithms sampled 8192 points from the point cloud as input to the odometry network. The projection-aware dense odometry pipeline takes all the pseudo-LiDAR point clouds generated from the images except for the error points as the input to the network. While making full use of the 3D geometric information in the images, the semantic information in the images is also used in the odometry task. The fusion of 2D-3D is achieved in an image-only based odometry. Experiments on the KITTI dataset prove the effectiveness of our method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first visual odometry method using pseudo-LiDAR.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |

These SLAM systems are required to support accurate localization with limited computational resources. In particular, point cloud registration, i.e., the process of matching and aligning multiple LiDAR scans collected at multiple locations in a global coordinate framework, has been deemed as the bottleneck step in SLAM. In this paper, we propose a feature filtering algorithm, PFilter, that can filter out invalid features and can thus greatly alleviate this bottleneck. Meanwhile, the overall registration accuracy is also improved due to the carefully curated feature points. We integrate PFilter into the well-established scan-to-map LiDAR odometry framework, F-LOAM, and evaluate its performance on the KITTI dataset. The experimental results show that PFilter can remove about 48.4% of the points in the local feature map and reduce feature points in scan by 19.3% on average, which save 20.9% processing time per frame. In the mean time, we improve the accuracy by 9.4%.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures. Accepted for IEEE IROS 2022</p></details> |

Research indicates that diverse LiDAR points have different influences on the accuracy of pose estimation. This study aimed to select a good point set to enhance accuracy. Accordingly, the sensitivity and uncertainty of LiDAR point residuals were formulated as a fundamental basis for derivation and analysis. High-sensitivity and low -uncertainty point residual terms are preferred to achieve higher pose estimation accuracy. The proposed selection method has been theoretically proven to be capable of achieving a global statistical optimum. It was tested on artificial data and compared with the KITTI benchmark. It was also implemented in LiDAR odometry (LO) and LiDAR inertial odometry (LIO), both indoors and outdoors. The experiments revealed that utilizing selected LiDAR point residuals simultaneously enhances optimization accuracy, decreases residual terms, and guarantees real-time performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning-based Localizability Estimation for Robust LiDAR Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05698v2)** | 2022-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR-based localization and mapping is one of the core components in many modern robotic systems due to the direct integration of range and geometry, allowing for precise motion estimation and generation of high quality maps in real-time. Yet, as a consequence of insufficient environmental constraints present in the scene, this dependence on geometry can result in localization failure, happening in self-symmetric surroundings such as tunnels. This work addresses precisely this issue by proposing a neural network-based estimation approach for detecting (non-)localizability during robot operation. Special attention is given to the localizability of scan-to-scan registration, as it is a crucial component in many LiDAR odometry estimation pipelines. In contrast to previous, mostly traditional detection approaches, the proposed method enables early detection of failure by estimating the localizability on raw sensor measurements without evaluating the underlying registration optimization. Moreover, previous approaches remain limited in their ability to generalize across environments and sensor types, as heuristic-tuning of degeneracy detection thresholds is required. The proposed approach avoids this problem by learning from a collection of different environments, allowing the network to function over various scenarios. Furthermore, the network is trained exclusively on simulated data, avoiding arduous data collection in challenging and degenerate, often hard-to-access, environments. The presented method is tested during field experiments conducted across challenging environments and on two different sensor types without any modifications. The observed detection performance is on par with state-of-the-art methods after environment-specific threshold tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Scan matching, the process of estimating the rigid transformation that best aligns two point clouds, is the basis for lidar odometry, a form of dead reckoning. Lidar odometry is particularly useful when absolute sensors, like GPS, are not available. Here we propose the Iterative Closest Ellipsoidal Transform (ICET), a scan matching algorithm which provides two novel improvements over the current state-of-the-art Normal Distributions Transform (NDT). Like NDT, ICET decomposes lidar data into voxels and fits a Gaussian distribution to the points within each voxel. The first innovation of ICET reduces geometric ambiguity along large flat surfaces by suppressing the solution along those directions. The second innovation of ICET is to infer the output error covariance associated with the position and orientation transformation between successive point clouds; the error covariance is particularly useful when ICET is incorporated into a state-estimation routine such as an extended Kalman filter. We constructed a simulation to compare the performance of ICET and NDT in 2D space both with and without geometric ambiguity and found that ICET produces superior estimates while accurately predicting solution accuracy.</p></details> |  |

However, achieving reliable and efficient performance on heterogeneous platforms in large-scale environments remains an open challenge due to the limitations of onboard computation and memory resources needed for autonomous operation. In this work, we present LOCUS 2.0, a robust and computationally-efficient \lidar odometry system for real-time underground 3D mapping. LOCUS 2.0 includes a novel normals-based \morrell{Generalized Iterative Closest Point (GICP)} formulation that reduces the computation time of point cloud alignment, an adaptive voxel grid filter that maintains the desired computation load regardless of the environment's geometry, and a sliding-window map approach that bounds the memory consumption. The proposed approach is shown to be suitable to be deployed on heterogeneous robotic platforms involved in large-scale explorations under severe computation and memory constraints. We demonstrate LOCUS 2.0, a key element of the CoSTAR team's entry in the DARPA Subterranean Challenge, across various underground scenarios. We release LOCUS 2.0 as an open-source library and also release a \lidar-based odometry dataset in challenging and large-scale underground environments.

In particular, ground-optimized LiDAR odometry usually employs ground segmentation as a preprocessing method. This is because most of the points in a 3D point cloud captured by a 3D LiDAR sensor on a terrestrial platform are from the ground. However, the effect of the performance of ground segmentation on LiDAR odometry is still not closely examined. In this paper, a robust ground-optimized LiDAR odometry framework is proposed to facilitate the study to check the effect of ground segmentation on LiDAR SLAM based on the state-of-the-art (SOTA) method. By using our proposed odometry framework, it is easy and straightforward to test whether ground segmentation algorithms help extract well-described features and thus improve SLAM performance. In addition, by leveraging the SOTA ground segmentation method called Patchwork, which shows robust ground segmentation even in complex and uneven urban environments with little performance perturbation, a novel ground-optimized LiDAR odometry is proposed, called PaGO-LOAM. The methods were tested using the KITTI odometry dataset. \textit{PaGO-LOAM} shows robust and accurate performance compared with the baseline method.

| **[LiDAR SLAMMOT based on Confidence-guided Data Association](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01041v1)** | 2024-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the field of autonomous driving or robotics, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and multi-object tracking (MOT) are two fundamental problems and are generally applied separately. Solutions to SLAM and MOT usually rely on certain assumptions, such as the static environment assumption for SLAM and the accurate ego-vehicle pose assumption for MOT. But in complex dynamic environments, it is difficult or even impossible to meet these assumptions. Therefore, the SLAMMOT, i.e., simultaneous localization, mapping, and moving object tracking, integrated system of SLAM and object tracking, has emerged for autonomous vehicles in dynamic environments. However, many conventional SLAMMOT solutions directly perform data association on the predictions and detections for object tracking, but ignore their quality. In practice, inaccurate predictions caused by continuous multi-frame missed detections in temporary occlusion scenarios, may degrade the performance of tracking, thereby affecting SLAMMOT. To address this challenge, this paper presents a LiDAR SLAMMOT based on confidence-guided data association (Conf SLAMMOT) method, which tightly couples the LiDAR SLAM and the confidence-guided data association based multi-object tracking into a graph optimization backend for estimating the state of the ego-vehicle and objects simultaneously. The confidence of prediction and detection are applied in the factor graph-based multi-object tracking for its data association, which not only avoids the performance degradation caused by incorrect initial assignments in some filter-based methods but also handles issues such as continuous missed detection in tracking while also improving the overall performance of SLAMMOT. Various comparative experiments demonstrate the superior advantages of Conf SLAMMOT, especially in scenes with some missed detections.</p></details> |  |
| **[Visual SLAMMOT Considering Multiple Motion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19134v1)** | 2024-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) are pivotal tasks in the realm of autonomous driving, attracting considerable research attention. While SLAM endeavors to generate real-time maps and determine the vehicle's pose in unfamiliar settings, MOT focuses on the real-time identification and tracking of multiple dynamic objects. Despite their importance, the prevalent approach treats SLAM and MOT as independent modules within an autonomous vehicle system, leading to inherent limitations. Classical SLAM methodologies often rely on a static environment assumption, suitable for indoor rather than dynamic outdoor scenarios. Conversely, conventional MOT techniques typically rely on the vehicle's known state, constraining the accuracy of object state estimations based on this prior. To address these challenges, previous efforts introduced the unified SLAMMOT paradigm, yet primarily focused on simplistic motion patterns. In our team's previous work IMM-SLAMMOT\cite{IMM-SLAMMOT}, we present a novel methodology incorporating consideration of multiple motion models into SLAMMOT i.e. tightly coupled SLAM and MOT, demonstrating its efficacy in LiDAR-based systems. This paper studies feasibility and advantages of instantiating this methodology as visual SLAMMOT, bridging the gap between LiDAR and vision-based sensing mechanisms. Specifically, we propose a solution of visual SLAMMOT considering multiple motion models and validate the inherent advantages of IMM-SLAMMOT in the visual domain.</p></details> |  |
| **[Communication-Efficient Cooperative SLAMMOT via Determining the Number of Collaboration Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17432v1)** | 2024-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The SLAMMOT, i.e. simultaneous localization, mapping, and moving object (detection and) tracking, represents an emerging technology for autonomous vehicles in dynamic environments. Such single-vehicle systems still have inherent limitations, such as occlusion issues. Inspired by SLAMMOT and rapidly evolving cooperative technologies, it is natural to explore cooperative simultaneous localization, mapping, moving object (detection and) tracking (C-SLAMMOT) to enhance state estimation for ego-vehicles and moving objects. C-SLAMMOT could significantly upgrade the single-vehicle performance by utilizing and integrating the shared information through communication among the multiple vehicles. This inevitably leads to a fundamental trade-off between performance and communication cost, especially in a scalable manner as the number of collaboration vehicles increases. To address this challenge, we propose a LiDAR-based communication-efficient C-SLAMMOT (CE C-SLAMMOT) method by determining the number of collaboration vehicles. In CE C-SLAMMOT, we adopt descriptor-based methods for enhancing ego-vehicle pose estimation and spatial confidence map-based methods for cooperative object perception, allowing for the continuous and dynamic selection of the corresponding critical collaboration vehicles and interaction content. This approach avoids the waste of precious communication costs by preventing the sharing of information from certain collaborative vehicles that may contribute little or no performance gain, compared to the baseline method of exchanging raw observation information among all vehicles. Comparative experiments in various aspects have confirmed that the proposed method achieves a good trade-off between performance and communication costs, while also outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in cooperative perception performance.</p></details> |  |

To achieve accurate positioning, vehicles typically use global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receivers to validate their absolute positions. However, GNSS-based positioning can be compromised by interference signals, necessitating the identification, classification, determination of purpose, and localization of such interference to mitigate or eliminate it. Recent approaches based on machine learning (ML) have shown superior performance in monitoring interference. However, their feasibility in real-world applications and environments has yet to be assessed. Effective implementation of ML techniques requires training datasets that incorporate realistic interference signals, including real-world noise and potential multipath effects that may occur between transmitter, receiver, and satellite in the operational area. Additionally, these datasets require reference labels. Creating such datasets is often challenging due to legal restrictions, as causing interference to GNSS sources is strictly prohibited. Consequently, the performance of ML-based methods in practical applications remains unclear. To address this gap, we describe a series of large-scale measurement campaigns conducted in real-world settings at two highway locations in Germany and the Seetal Alps in Austria, and in large-scale controlled indoor environments. We evaluate the latest supervised ML-based methods to report on their performance in real-world settings and present the applicability of pseudo-labeling for unsupervised learning. We demonstrate the challenges of combining datasets due to data discrepancies and evaluate outlier detection, domain adaptation, and data augmentation techniques to present the models' capabilities to adapt to changes in the datasets.</p></details> | 34 pages, 25 figures |

The detection of anomalies within frequency snapshots is crucial to counteract these interferences effectively. A critical preliminary countermeasure involves the reliable classification of interferences and the characterization and localization of jamming devices. This paper introduces an extensive dataset comprising snapshots obtained from a low-frequency antenna that capture various generated interferences within a large-scale environment, including controlled multipath effects. Our objective is to assess the resilience of machine learning (ML) models against environmental changes, such as multipath effects, variations in interference attributes, such as interference class, bandwidth, and signal power, the accuracy jamming device localization, and the constraints imposed by snapshot input lengths. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance of a diverse set of 129 distinct vision encoder models across all tasks.

While extensive research has explored 3DGS for indoor trajectory tracking using visual sensor alone or in combination with Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), its integration with GNSS for large-scale outdoor navigation remains underexplored. To address these concerns, we proposed GS-GVINS: a tightly-integrated GNSS-Visual-Inertial Navigation System augmented by 3DGS. This system leverages 3D Gaussian as a continuous differentiable scene representation in largescale outdoor environments, enhancing navigation performance through the constructed 3D Gaussian map. Notably, GS-GVINS is the first GNSS-Visual-Inertial navigation application that directly utilizes the analytical jacobians of SE3 camera pose with respect to 3D Gaussians. To maintain the quality of 3DGS rendering in extreme dynamic states, we introduce a motionaware 3D Gaussian pruning mechanism, updating the map based on relative pose translation and the accumulated opacity along the camera ray. For validation, we test our system under different driving environments: open-sky, sub-urban, and urban. Both self-collected and public datasets are used for evaluation. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of GS-GVINS in enhancing navigation accuracy across diverse driving environments.</p></details> |  |

Cross-checking the GNSS-provided time against alternative multiple trusted time sources can lead to attack detection aiming at controlling the GNSS receiver time. Leveraging external, network-connected secure time providers and onboard clock references, we achieve detection even under fine-grained time attacks. We provide an extensive evaluation of our multi-layered defense against adversaries mounting attacks against the GNSS receiver along with controlling the network link. We implement adversaries spanning from simplistic spoofers to advanced ones synchronized with the GNSS constellation. We demonstrate attack detection is possible in all tested cases (sharp discontinuity, smooth take-over, and coordinated network manipulation) without changes to the structure of the GNSS receiver. Leveraging the diversity of the reference time sources, detection of take-over time push as low as 150us is possible. Smooth take-overs forcing variations as low as 30ns are also detected based on on-board precision oscillators. The method (and thus the evaluation) is largely agnostic to the satellite constellation and the attacker type, making time-based data validation of GNSS information compatible with existing receivers and readily deployable.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems (Early Access)</p></details> |

FGO exhibits superior estimation accuracy compared with traditional state estimation methods that rely on least-squares or Kalman filters. However, only a few FGO libraries are specialized for GNSS observations. This paper introduces an open-source GNSS FGO package named gtsam\_gnss, which has a simple structure and can be easily applied to GNSS research and development. This package separates the preprocessing of GNSS observations from factor optimization. Moreover, it describes the error function of the GNSS factor in a straightforward manner, allowing for general-purpose inputs. This design facilitates the transition from ordinary least-squares-based positioning to FGO and supports user-specific GNSS research. In addition, gtsam\_gnss includes analytical examples involving various factors using GNSS data in real urban environments. This paper presents three application examples: the use of a robust error model, estimation of integer ambiguity in the carrier phase, and combination of GNSS and inertial measurements from smartphones. The proposed framework demonstrates excellent state estimation performance across all use cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 2025 IEEE/ION Position, Location and Navigation Symposium (PLANS)</p></details> |
| **[Consumer INS Coupled with Carrier Phase Measurements for GNSS Spoofing Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03870v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Global Navigation Satellite Systems enable precise localization and timing even for highly mobile devices, but legacy implementations provide only limited support for the new generation of security-enhanced signals. Inertial Measurement Units have proved successful in augmenting the accuracy and robustness of the GNSS-provided navigation solution, but effective navigation based on inertial techniques in denied contexts requires high-end sensors. However, commercially available mobile devices usually embed a much lower-grade inertial system. To counteract an attacker transmitting all the adversarial signals from a single antenna, we exploit carrier phase-based observations coupled with a low-end inertial sensor to identify spoofing and meaconing. By short-time integration with an inertial platform, which tracks the displacement of the GNSS antenna, the high-frequency movement at the receiver is correlated with the variation in the carrier phase. In this way, we identify legitimate transmitters, based on their geometrical diversity with respect to the antenna system movement. We introduce a platform designed to effectively compare different tiers of commercial INS platforms with a GNSS receiver. By characterizing different inertial sensors, we show that simple MEMS INS perform as well as high-end industrial-grade sensors. Sensors traditionally considered unsuited for navigation purposes offer great performance at the short integration times used to evaluate the carrier phase information consistency against the high-frequency movement. Results from laboratory evaluation and through field tests at Jammertest 2024 show that the detector is up to 90% accurate in correctly identifying spoofing (or the lack of it), without any modification to the receiver structure, and with mass-production grade INS typical for mobile phones.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at ION ITM/PTTI 2025</p></details> |

This system works with a heterogeneous system consisting of multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) to perform inspection and intervention tasks in GNSS-denied or interrupted environments. The carrier, an electric catamaran measuring 4m by 7m, features a 4m by 6m deck supporting automated takeoff and landing for four DJI M300 drones, along with a 10kg-payload manipulator operable in up to level 3 sea conditions. Utilizing an offshore gimbal camera for navigation, the carrier can autonomously navigate, approach and dock with non-cooperative vessels, guided by an onboard camera, LiDAR, and Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) over a 3 km$^2$ area. UAVs equipped with onboard Ultra-Wideband (UWB) technology execute mapping, detection, and manipulation tasks using a versatile gripper designed for wet, saline conditions. Additionally, two UAVs can coordinate to transport large objects to the manipulator or interact directly with them. These procedures are fully automated and were successfully demonstrated at the Mohammed Bin Zayed International Robotic Competition (MBZIRC2024), where the drone carrier equipped with four UAVS and one manipulator, automatically accomplished the intervention tasks in sea-level-3 (wave height 1.25m) based on the rough target information.</p></details> | 15 pages, 12pages |
| **[PO-GVINS: Tightly Coupled GNSS-Visual-Inertial Integration with Pose-Only Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07259v2)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and reliable positioning is crucial for perception, decision-making, and other high-level applications in autonomous driving, unmanned aerial vehicles, and intelligent robots. Given the inherent limitations of standalone sensors, integrating heterogeneous sensors with complementary capabilities is one of the most effective approaches to achieving this goal. In this paper, we propose a filtering-based, tightly coupled global navigation satellite system (GNSS)-visual-inertial positioning framework with a pose-only formulation applied to the visual-inertial system (VINS), termed PO-GVINS. Specifically, multiple-view imaging used in current VINS requires a priori of 3D feature, then jointly estimate camera poses and 3D feature position, which inevitably introduces linearization error of the feature as well as facing dimensional explosion. However, the pose-only (PO) formulation, which is demonstrated to be equivalent to the multiple-view imaging and has been applied in visual reconstruction, represent feature depth using two camera poses and thus 3D feature position is removed from state vector avoiding aforementioned difficulties. Inspired by this, we first apply PO formulation in our VINS, i.e., PO-VINS. GNSS raw measurements are then incorporated with integer ambiguity resolved to achieve accurate and drift-free estimation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed PO-VINS significantly outperforms the multi-state constrained Kalman filter (MSCKF). By incorporating GNSS measurements, PO-GVINS achieves accurate, drift-free state estimation, making it a robust solution for positioning in challenging environments.</p></details> |  |

Despite their adaptability and efficiency, LLMs have not been extensively explored for signal processing tasks, particularly in the domain of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) interference monitoring. GNSS interference monitoring is essential to ensure the reliability of vehicle localization on roads, a critical requirement for numerous applications. However, GNSS-based positioning is vulnerable to interference from jamming devices, which can compromise its accuracy. The primary objective is to identify, classify, and mitigate these interferences. Interpreting GNSS snapshots and the associated interferences presents significant challenges due to the inherent complexity, including multipath effects, diverse interference types, varying sensor characteristics, and satellite constellations. In this paper, we extract features from a large GNSS dataset and employ LLaVA to retrieve relevant information from an extensive knowledge base. We employ prompt engineering to interpret the interferences and environmental factors, and utilize t-SNE to analyze the feature embeddings. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed method is capable of visual and logical reasoning within the GNSS context. Furthermore, our pipeline outperforms state-of-the-art machine learning models in interference classification tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Wheel-GINS: A GNSS/INS Integrated Navigation System with a Wheel-mounted IMU](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03079v1)** | 2025-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A long-term accurate and robust localization system is essential for mobile robots to operate efficiently outdoors. Recent studies have shown the significant advantages of the wheel-mounted inertial measurement unit (Wheel-IMU)-based dead reckoning system. However, it still drifts over extended periods because of the absence of external correction signals. To achieve the goal of long-term accurate localization, we propose Wheel-GINS, a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)/inertial navigation system (INS) integrated navigation system using a Wheel-IMU. Wheel-GINS fuses the GNSS position measurement with the Wheel-IMU via an extended Kalman filter to limit the long-term error drift and provide continuous state estimation when the GNSS signal is blocked. Considering the specificities of the GNSS/Wheel-IMU integration, we conduct detailed modeling and online estimation of the Wheel-IMU installation parameters, including the Wheel-IMU leverarm and mounting angle and the wheel radius error. Experimental results have shown that Wheel-GINS outperforms the traditional GNSS/Odometer/INS integrated navigation system during GNSS outages. At the same time, Wheel-GINS can effectively estimate the Wheel-IMU installation parameters online and, consequently, improve the localization accuracy and practicality of the system. The source code of our implementation is publicly available (https://github.com/i2Nav-WHU/Wheel-GINS).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems</p></details> |

As the backbone for positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) across various applications including transportation, telecommunications, and emergency services GNSS is vulnerable to deliberate interference that poses significant risks. Spoofing attacks, which involve transmitting counterfeit GNSS signals to mislead receivers into calculating incorrect positions, can result in serious consequences, from navigational errors in civilian aviation to security breaches in military operations. Furthermore, the lack of inherent security measures within GNSS systems makes them attractive targets for adversaries. While GNSS/GPS jamming and spoofing systems consist of numerous components, the ability to distinguish authentic signals from malicious ones is essential for maintaining system integrity. Recent advancements in machine learning and deep learning provide promising avenues for enhancing detection and mitigation strategies against these threats. This paper addresses both spoofing and jamming by tackling real-world challenges through machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision techniques. Through extensive experiments on two real-world datasets related to spoofing and jamming detection using advanced algorithms, we achieved state of the art results. In the GNSS/GPS jamming detection task, we attained approximately 99% accuracy, improving performance by around 5% compared to previous studies. Additionally, we addressed a challenging tasks related to spoofing detection, yielding results that underscore the potential of machine learning and deep learning in this domain.</p></details> |  |

Each device trains the model on its local server and shares only the model updates (i.e., gradient weights) during the aggregation step. A significant challenge in FL is managing the feature distribution of novel and unbalanced data across devices. In this paper, we propose an FL approach using few-shot learning and aggregation of the model weights on a global server. We introduce a dynamic early stopping method to balance out-of-distribution classes based on representation learning, specifically utilizing the maximum mean discrepancy of feature embeddings between local and global models. An exemplary application of FL is to orchestrate machine learning models along highways for interference classification based on snapshots from global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receivers. Extensive experiments on four GNSS datasets from two real-world highways and controlled environments demonstrate that our FL method surpasses state-of-the-art techniques in adapting to both novel interference classes and multipath scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Git r...</summary><p>Git repository: https://gitlab.cc-asp.fraunhofer.de/darcy_gnss/federated_learning</p></details> |

While global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) provide low-cost and reliable positioning services, they are often hindered in complex urban canyon environments. Thus, exploring opportunistic signals for positioning in urban areas has become a key solution. Augmented reality (AR) allows pedestrians to acquire real-time visual information. Accordingly, we propose a low-cost visual-inertial positioning solution. This method comprises a lightweight multi-scale group convolution (MSGC)-based visual place recognition (VPR) neural network, a pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) algorithm, and a visual/inertial fusion approach based on a Kalman filter with gross error suppression. The VPR serves as a conditional observation to the Kalman filter, effectively correcting the errors accumulated through the PDR method. This enables the entire algorithm to ensure the reliability of long-term positioning in GNSS-denied areas. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method maintains stable positioning during large-scale movements. Compared to the lightweight MobileNetV3-based VPR method, our proposed VPR solution improves Recall@1 by at least 3\% on two public datasets while reducing the number of parameters by 63.37\%. It also achieves performance that is comparable to the VGG16-based method. The VPR-PDR algorithm improves localization accuracy by more than 40\% compared to the original PDR.</p></details> |  |

These environments are typically challenging for conventional vision-based state estimation due to the lack of distinct visual landmarks and the instability of vehicle poses. To address this, BEVRender generates high-quality local bird's-eye-view(BEV) images of the local terrain. Subsequently, these images are aligned with a geo referenced aerial map through template matching to achieve accurate cross-view registration. Our approach overcomes the inherent limitations of visual inertial odometry systems and the substantial storage requirements of image-retrieval localization strategies, which are susceptible to drift and scalability issues, respectively. Extensive experimentation validates BEVRender's advancement over existing GNSS-denied visual localization methods, demonstrating notable enhancements in both localization accuracy and update frequency.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, accepted by IROS2024</p></details> |

This work provides the necessary checks and synchronization protocols needed in the broadcast-only GNSS context. We provide proof of security for each of our algorithms under a delay-capable adversary. The algorithms included herein enable a GNSS receiver to use its onboard, GNSS-independent clock to determine whether a message arrived at the correct time, to determine whether its onboard, GNSS-independent clock is safe to use and when the clock will no longer be safe in the future due to predicted clock drift, and to resynchronize its onboard, GNSS-independent clock. Each algorithm is safe to use even when an adversary induces delays within the protocol. Moreover, we discuss the implications of GNSS authentication schemes that use two simultaneous TESLA instances of different authentication cadences. To a receiver implementer or standards author, this work provides the necessary implementation algorithms to assert security and provides a comprehensive guide on why these methods are required.</p></details> | 16 pages, 15 figures |
| **[Road User Classification from High-Frequency GNSS Data Using Distributed Edge Intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00132v1)** | 2024-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world traffic involves diverse road users, ranging from pedestrians to heavy trucks, necessitating effective road user classification for various applications within Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS). Traditional approaches often rely on intrusive and/or expensive external hardware sensors. These systems typically have limited spatial coverage. In response to these limitations, this work aims to investigate an unintrusive and cost-effective alternative for road user classification by using high-frequency (1-2 Hz) positional sequences. A cutting-edge solution could involve leveraging positioning data from 5G networks. However, this feature is currently only proposed in the 3GPP standard and has not yet been implemented for outdoor applications by 5G equipment vendors. Therefore, our approach relies on positional data, that is recorded under real-world conditions using Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and processed on distributed edge devices. As a start-ing point, four types of road users are distinguished: pedestri-ans, cyclists, motorcycles, and passenger cars. While earlier approaches used classical statistical methods, we propose Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks (RNNs) as the preferred classification method, as they repre-sent state-of-the-art in processing sequential data. An RNN architecture for road user classification, based on selected motion characteristics derived from raw positional sequences is presented and the influence of sequence length on classifica-tion quality is examined. The results of the work show that RNNs are capable of efficiently classifying road users on dis-tributed devices, and can particularly differentiate between types of motorized vehicles, based on two- to four-minute se-quences.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Aerial Transport System in Marine GNSS-Denied Environment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01603v1)** | 2024-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents an autonomous aerial system specifically engineered for operation in challenging marine GNSS-denied environments, aimed at transporting small cargo from a target vessel. In these environments, characterized by weakly textured sea surfaces with few feature points, chaotic deck oscillations due to waves, and significant wind gusts, conventional navigation methods often prove inadequate. Leveraging the DJI M300 platform, our system is designed to autonomously navigate and transport cargo while overcoming these environmental challenges. In particular, this paper proposes an anchor-based localization method using ultrawideband (UWB) and QR codes facilities, which decouples the UAV's attitude from that of the moving landing platform, thus reducing control oscillations caused by platform movement. Additionally, a motor-driven attachment mechanism for cargo is designed, which enhances the UAV's field of view during descent and ensures a reliable attachment to the cargo upon landing. The system's reliability and effectiveness were progressively enhanced through multiple outdoor experimental iterations and were validated by the successful cargo transport during the 2024 Mohamed BinZayed International Robotics Challenge (MBZIRC2024) competition. Crucially, the system addresses uncertainties and interferences inherent in maritime transportation missions without prior knowledge of cargo locations on the deck and with strict limitations on intervention throughout the transportation.</p></details> |  |

Integrity monitoring (IM) capability is required when FGO-based integrated navigation system is used for safety-critical applications. However, traditional researches on IM of integrated navigation system are mostly based on Kalman filter. It is urgent to develop effective IM scheme for FGO-based GNSS/INS/Vision integration. In this contribution, the position error bounding formula to ensure the integrity of the GNSS/INS/Vision integration based on FGO is designed and validated for the first time. It can be calculated by the linearized equations from the residuals of GNSS pseudo-range, IMU pre-integration and visual measurements. The specific position error bounding is given in the case of GNSS, INS and visual measurement faults. Field experiments were conducted to evaluate and validate the performance of the proposed position error bounding. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed position error bounding for the GNSS/INS/Vision integration based on FGO can correctly fit the position error against different fault modes, and the availability of integrity in six fault modes is 100% after correct and timely fault exclusion.</p></details> |  |
| **[A framework for GNSS-based solutions performance analysis in an ERTMS context](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18510v1)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Context Progresses in GNSS-based solution introduction in rail applications GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) is now used in most of our travels and each of our smartphone apps. Most of the usages are not safety-critical. But Europe identified GNSS for more applications and to be integrated in rail in general as part of the toolset to help railway to contribute to reduce transport carbon footprint. To increase the use of trains in European transports, railways must improve their attractiveness for passengers and freight, but also increase reliability, availability and efficiency by reducing capital expenditure and operational costs. GNSS is part of the global digitalization scheme of freight that aims to offer added value to the clients knowledge of accurate time of arrival, continuous monitoring of transport conditions (temperature, humidity...). But a major challenge will be to reach stringent applications and in particular, GNSS is today seen as a realistic and serious game changer for the future of the ERTMS (European Rail Traffic Management System). The localisation function is today performed with both odometry and balises. Odometer provides a continuous train position in time from a reference point. But as the distance delivered by the odometer shows a growing bias with distance, due to wear and wheel sliding, the use of on-track balises allows to reduce this error. Future systems will be based on on-board localisation solutions with GNSS receivers. It will allow the development of new concepts for moving blocks, virtual coupling and automation. Its use for train integrity is also investigated. But the environmental conditions of track and surroundings configuration, i.e, tunnels, dense urban areas or vegetation often degrade positioning performance and thus its efficiency and safety. Indeed, GNSS satellites are moving and their visibility (availability and relative position from the receiver) vary with time. Moreover, for optimal performance, the system requires open sky environments, which are the cases of most of the aeronautical uses but not of train uses. Trains often circulate in areas where signal reception can be disturbed (multipath, intentional or unintentional interferences) and thus, performances degraded. If many progresses have been made in the past years to develop more robust receivers [Puccitelli, 2022], multi-sensor solutions [CLUG website] or missing tools such as Digital Maps [Crespillo, 2023], in projects such as the Shift2Rail Project X2Rail-5 or CLUG, some questions remain and in particular related to performance evaluation. How can we evaluate performances in a dynamic environment (train, satellite, obstacles)? How can we be sure that every configuration has been tested? What is the impact of a failure (inaccuracy, missed detection) on operation? Some of these issues are addressed in the on-going R2DATO project funded by Europe's rail.</p></details> |  |

Existing studies on geomagnetic navigation, i.e., matching navigation and bionic navigation, rely on pre-stored map or extensive searches, leading to limited applicability or reduced navigation efficiency in unexplored areas. To address the issues with geomagnetic navigation in areas where GNSS is unavailable, this paper develops a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based mechanism, especially for long-distance geomagnetic navigation. The designed mechanism trains an agent to learn and gain the magnetoreception capacity for geomagnetic navigation, rather than using any pre-stored map or extensive and expensive searching approaches. Particularly, we integrate the geomagnetic gradient-based parallel approach into geomagnetic navigation. This integration mitigates the over-exploration of the learning agent by adjusting the geomagnetic gradient, such that the obtained gradient is aligned towards the destination. We explore the effectiveness of the proposed approach via detailed numerical simulations, where we implement twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) in realizing the proposed approach. The results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing metaheuristic and bionic navigation methods in long-distance missions under diverse navigation conditions.</p></details> |  |

However, the successful execution of a UAV mission is very often dependent on the use of a GNSS. Unfortunately, the vulnerability of GNSS signals, due to their lack of encryption and authentication, poses a significant cybersecurity issue. This vulnerability makes various attacks, particularly the "GNSS spoofing attack," and "GNSS jamming attack" easily executable. Generally speaking, during this attack, the drone is manipulated into altering its path, usually resulting in an immediate forced landing or crash. As far as we know, we are the first to propose a lightweight-solution that enable a drone to autonomously rescue itself, assuming it is under GNSS attack and the GNSS is no longer available, and return safely to its initial takeoff position, thereby preventing any potential crashes. During the flight, wind plays a critical role as it can instantaneously alter the drone's position. To solve this problem, we have devised a highly effective 2-phases solution: (i) Forward Phase, for monitoring and recording the forward journey, and (ii) Backward Phase, that generates a backward route, based on the Forward Phase and wind presence. The final solution ensures strong performance in consistently returning the drone to the original position, even in wind situations, while maintaining a very fast computation time.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This article has been accepted for publication in the proceedings of the 2024 IEEE International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking And Communications (WiMob)</p></details> |

Enabling the use of high-accuracy GNSS sensors, this work focuses on the antenna lever arm calibration. We propose a globally optimal multi-antenna lever arm calibration approach based on motion measurements. For this, we derive an optimization method that further allows the integration of a-priori knowledge. Globally optimal solutions are obtained by leveraging the Lagrangian dual problem and a primal recovery strategy. Generally, motion-based calibration for autonomous vehicles is known to be difficult due to cars' predominantly planar motion. Therefore, we first describe the motion requirements for a unique solution and then propose a planar motion extension to overcome this issue and enable a calibration based on the restricted motion of autonomous vehicles.

| **[pyrtklib: An open-source package for tightly coupled deep learning and GNSS integration for positioning in urban canyons](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12996v1)** | 2024-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing numerous fields, with increasing applications in Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) positioning algorithms in intelligent transportation systems (ITS) via deep learning. However, a significant technological disparity exists as traditional GNSS algorithms are often developed in Fortran or C, contrasting with the Python-based implementation prevalent in deep learning tools. To address this discrepancy, this paper introduces pyrtklib, a Python binding for the widely utilized open-source GNSS tool, RTKLIB. This binding makes all RTKLIB functionalities accessible in Python, facilitating seamless integration. Moreover, we present a deep learning subsystem under pyrtklib, which is a novel deep learning framework that leverages pyrtklib to accurately predict weights and biases within the GNSS positioning process. The use of pyrtklib enables developers to easily and quickly prototype and implement deep learning-aided GNSS algorithms, showcasing its potential to enhance positioning accuracy significantly.</p></details> |  |

In a tutorial and unified exposition, we recall the recent theory of two-frame systems within the field of invariant Kalman filtering. We then show how to adapt it geometrically to address the considered problem, although it seems at first sight out of its scope. This yields an invariant extended Kalman filter having autonomous error equations, and state-independent Jacobians, which is shown to work remarkably well in simulations. The proposed novel construction thus extends the application scope of invariant filtering.</p></details> |  |
| **[An innovation-based cycle-slip, multipath estimation, detection and mitigation method for tightly coupled GNSS/INS/Vision navigation in urban areas](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03433v1)** | 2024-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Precise, consistent, and reliable positioning is crucial for a multitude of uses. In order to achieve high precision global positioning services, multi-sensor fusion techniques, such as the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)/Inertial Navigation System (INS)/Vision integration system, combine the strengths of various sensors. This technique is essential for localization in complex environments and has been widely used in the mass market. However, frequent signal deterioration and blocking in urban environments exacerbates the degradation of GNSS positioning and negatively impacts the performance of the multi-sensor integration system. For GNSS pseudorange and carrier phase observation data in the urban environment, we offer an innovation-based cycle slip/multipath estimation, detection, and mitigation (I-EDM) method to reduce the influence of multipath effects and cycle slips on location induced by obstruction in urban settings. The method obtains the innovations of GNSS observations with the cluster analysis method. Then the innovations are used to detect the cycle slips and multipath. Compared with the residual-based method, the innovation-based method avoids the residual overfitting caused by the least square method, resulting in better detection of outliers within the GNSS observations. The vehicle tests carried out in urban settings verify the proposed approach. Experimental results indicate that the accuracy of 0.23m, 0.11m, and 0.31m in the east, north and up components can be achieved by the GNSS/INS/Vision tightly coupled system with the I-EDM method, which has a maximum of 21.6% improvement when compared with the residual-based EDM (R-EDM) method.</p></details> |  |

However, in complex urban canyon environments, the vulnerability of a stand-alone sensor and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) caused by high buildings, trees, and elevated structures seriously affect positioning results. To address these challenges, a sky-view images segmentation algorithm based on Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) is proposed for GNSS NLOS detection. Building upon this, a novel NLOS detection and mitigation algorithm (named S-NDM) is extended to the tightly coupled Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), Inertial Measurement Units (IMU), and visual feature system which is called Sky-GVIO, with the aim of achieving continuous and accurate positioning in urban canyon environments. Furthermore, the system harmonizes Single Point Positioning (SPP) with Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) methodologies to bolster its operational versatility and resilience. In urban canyon environments, the positioning performance of S-NDM algorithm proposed in this paper is evaluated under different tightly coupled SPP-related and RTK-related models. The results exhibit that Sky-GVIO system achieves meter-level accuracy under SPP mode and sub-decimeter precision with RTK, surpassing the performance of GNSS/INS/Vision frameworks devoid of S-NDM. Additionally, the sky-view image dataset, inclusive of training and evaluation subsets, has been made publicly accessible for scholarly exploration at https://github.com/whuwangjr/sky-view-images .</p></details> |  |

Both require spatial models for effective route planning and localization. This paper addresses the challenge of road graph construction for autonomous vehicles. Despite recent advances, creating a road graph remains labor-intensive and has yet to achieve full automation. The goal of this paper is to generate such graphs automatically and accurately. Modern cars are equipped with onboard sensors used for today's advanced driver assistance systems like lane keeping. We propose using global navigation satellite system (GNSS) traces and basic image data acquired from these standard sensors in consumer vehicles to estimate road-level maps with minimal effort. We exploit the spatial information in the data by framing the problem as a road centerline semantic segmentation task using a convolutional neural network. We also utilize the data's time series nature to refine the neural network's output by using map matching. We implemented and evaluated our method using a fleet of real consumer vehicles, only using the deployed onboard sensors. Our evaluation demonstrates that our approach not only matches existing methods on simpler road configurations but also significantly outperforms them on more complex road geometries and topologies.

Sensors are often corrupted in those complicated and large-scale environments. This paper introduces GNSS-FGO, an online and global trajectory estimator that fuses GNSS observations alongside multiple sensor measurements for robust vehicle localization. In GNSS-FGO, we fuse asynchronous sensor measurements into the graph with a continuous-time trajectory representation using Gaussian process regression. This enables querying states at arbitrary timestamps so that sensor observations are fused without requiring strict state and measurement synchronization. Thus, the proposed method presents a generalized factor graph for multi-sensor fusion. To evaluate and study different GNSS fusion strategies, we fuse GNSS measurements in loose and tight coupling with a speed sensor, IMU, and lidar-odometry. We employed datasets from measurement campaigns in Aachen, Duesseldorf, and Cologne in experimental studies and presented comprehensive discussions on sensor observations, smoother types, and hyperparameter tuning. Our results show that the proposed approach enables robust trajectory estimation in dense urban areas, where the classic multi-sensor fusion method fails due to sensor degradation. In a test sequence containing a 17km route through Aachen, the proposed method results in a mean 2D positioning error of 0.48m while fusing raw GNSS observations with lidar odometry in a tight coupling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the IEEE Transactions on Robotics</p></details> |
| **[FE-GUT: Factor Graph Optimization hybrid with Extended Kalman Filter for tightly coupled GNSS/UWB Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06915v1)** | 2024-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Precise positioning and navigation information has been increasingly important with the development of the consumer electronics market. Due to some deficits of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), such as susceptible to interferences, integrating of GNSS with additional alternative sensors is a promising approach to overcome the performance limitations of GNSS-based localization systems. Ultra-Wideband (UWB) can be used to enhance GNSS in constructing an integrated localization system. However, most low-cost UWB devices lack a hardware-level time synchronization feature, which necessitates the estimation and compensation of the time-offset in the tightly coupled GNSS/UWB integration. Given the flexibility of probabilistic graphical models, the time-offset can be modeled as an invariant constant in the discretization of the continuous model. This work proposes a novel architecture in which Factor Graph Optimization (FGO) is hybrid with Extend Kalman Filter (EKF) for tightly coupled GNSS/UWB integration with online Temporal calibration (FE-GUT). FGO is utilized to precisely estimate the time-offset, while EKF provides initailization for the new factors and performs time-offset compensation. Simulation-based experiments validate the integrated localization performance of FE-GUT. In a four-wheeled robot scenario, the results demonstrate that, compared to EKF, FE-GUT can improve horizontal and vertical localization accuracy by 58.59\% and 34.80\%, respectively, while the time-offset estimation accuracy is improved by 76.80\%.

This paper proposes a minimalist approach exploiting track geometry and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensor data. By integrating a discrete track map as a Look-Up Table (LUT) into a Particle Filter (PF) based solution, accurate train positioning is achieved with only an IMU sensor and track map data. The approach is tested on an open railway positioning data set, showing that accurate positioning (absolute errors below 10 m) can be maintained during GNSS outages up to 30 s in the given data. We simulate outages on different track segments and show that accurate positioning is reached during track curves and curvy railway lines. The approach can be used as a redundant complement to established positioning solutions to increase the position estimate's reliability and robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 10 figures, accepted to 27th International Conference on Information Fusion (FUSION 2024)</p></details> |

Multiple receivers with known reference positions (stations) can assist mobile receivers (rovers) in obtaining GNSS corrections and achieve centimeter-level accuracy on consumer devices. However, GNSS spoofing and jamming, nowadays achievable with off-the-shelf devices, are serious threats to the integrity and robustness of public correction networks. In this demo, we show how manipulation of the Position Navigation and Timing (PNT) solution at the reference station is reflected in the loss of baseline fix or degraded accuracy at the rover. Real Time Kinematics (RTK) corrections are valuable but fundamentally vulnerable: attacking the reference stations can harm all receivers (rovers) that rely on the targeted reference station.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in the 17th ACM Conference on Security and Privacy in Wireless and Mobile Networks</p></details> |

While network distribution of correction streams can be protected with common secure networking practices, the reference stations can still be attacked by GNSS spoofing or jamming. This work investigates (i) the effect RTK reference station spoofing has on the rover's PNT solution quality and (ii) the potential countermeasures towards hardening the RTK infrastructure.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in the 17th ACM Conference on Security and Privacy in Wireless and Mobile Networks</p></details> |

In this paper, we develop a novel GNSS-Visual-Inertial Navigation System (GVINS) that fuses visual, inertial, and raw GNSS measurements within the square-root inverse sliding window filtering (SRI-SWF) framework in a tightly coupled fashion, which thus is termed SRI-GVINS. In particular, for the first time, we deeply fuse the GNSS pseudorange, Doppler shift, single-differenced pseudorange, and double-differenced carrier phase measurements, along with the visual-inertial measurements. Inherited from the SRI-SWF, the proposed SRI-GVINS gains significant numerical stability and computational efficiency over the start-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we propose to use a filter to sequentially initialize the reference frame transformation till converges, rather than collecting measurements for batch optimization. We also perform online calibration of GNSS-IMU extrinsic parameters to mitigate the possible extrinsic parameter degradation. The proposed SRI-GVINS is extensively evaluated on our own collected UAV datasets and the results demonstrate that the proposed method is able to suppress VIO drift in real-time and also show the effectiveness of online GNSS-IMU extrinsic calibration. The experimental validation on the public datasets further reveals that the proposed SRI-GVINS outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncovering GNSS Interference with Aerial Mapping UAV](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07611v1)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers provide ubiquitous and precise position, navigation, and time (PNT) to a wide gamut of civilian and tactical infrastructures and devices. Due to the low GNSS received signal power, even low-power radiofrequency interference (RFI) sources are a serious threat to the GNSS integrity and availability. Nonetheless, RFI source localization is paramount yet hard, especially over large areas. Methods based on multi-rotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) exist but are often limited by hovering time, and require specific antenna and detectors. In comparison, fixed-wing planes allow longer missions but are more complex to operate and deploy. A vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) UAV combines the positive aspects of both platforms: high maneuverability, and long mission time and, jointly with highly integrated control systems, simple operation and deployment. Building upon the flexibility allowed by such a platform, we propose a method that combines advanced flight dynamics with high-performance consumer receivers to detect interference over large areas, with minimal interaction with the operator. The proposed system can detect multiple interference sources and map their area of influence, gaining situational awareness of poor GNSS quality or denied environments. Furthermore, it can estimate the relative heading and position of the interference source within tens of meters. The proposed method is validated with real-life measurements, successfully mapping two interference-affected areas and exposing radio equipment causing involuntary in-band interference.</p></details> | <details><summary>In pr...</summary><p>In proceedings of the 2024 IEEE Aerospace Conference (AeroConf)</p></details> |

Detecting anomalies in frequency snapshots is crucial to counteract these interferences effectively. The ability to adapt to diverse, unseen interference characteristics is essential for ensuring the reliability of GNSS in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a few-shot learning (FSL) approach to adapt to new interference classes. Our method employs quadruplet selection for the model to learn representations using various positive and negative interference classes. Furthermore, our quadruplet variant selects pairs based on the aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty to differentiate between similar classes. We recorded a dataset at a motorway with eight interference classes on which our FSL method with quadruplet loss outperforms other FSL techniques in jammer classification accuracy with 97.66%.

Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) provides the foundation for absolute positioning. Recently enhanced Precise Point Positioning (PPP) technology now offers corrections for GNSS on a global scale, with the potential to achieve accuracy suitable for real-time CAV applications. However, in obstructed sky conditions, GNSS signals are often affected by outliers; therefore, addressing outliers is crucial. In GNSS applications, there are many more measurements available than are required to meet the specification. Therefore, selecting measurements to avoid outliers is of interest. The recently developed Risk-Averse Performance-Specified (RAPS) state estimation optimally selects measurements to minimize outlier risk while meeting a positive semi-definite constraint on performance; at present, the existing solution methods are not suitable for real-time computation and have not been demonstrated using challenging real-world data or in Real-time PPP (RT-PPP) applications. This article makes contributions in a few directions. First, it uses a diagonal performance specification, which reduces computational costs relative to the positive semi-definite constraint. Second, this article considers GNSS RT-PPP applications. Third, the experiments use real-world GNSS data collected in challenging environments. The RT-PPP experimental results show that among the compared methods: all achieve comparable performance in open-sky conditions, and all exceed the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) specification; however, in challenging environments, the diagonal RAPS approach shows improvement of 6-19% over traditional methods. Throughout, RAPS achieves the lowest estimation risk.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages,2 figures, Accepted by 2024 American Control Conference</p></details> |

The Slant Total Electron Contents (STEC) is an important parameter for characterizing wave propagation, representing the integrated electron density along the ray of radio signals passing through the ionosphere. The accurate prediction of STEC is essential for mitigating the ionospheric impact particularly on Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). In this work, we propose a high-precision STEC prediction model named DeepONet-STEC, which learns nonlinear operators to predict the 4D temporal-spatial integrated parameter for specified ground station - satellite ray path globally. As a demonstration, we validate the performance of the model based on GNSS observation data for global and US-CORS regimes under ionospheric quiet and storm conditions. The DeepONet-STEC model results show that the three-day 72 hour prediction in quiet periods could achieve high accuracy using observation data by the Precise Point Positioning (PPP) with temporal resolution 30s. Under active solar magnetic storm periods, the DeepONet-STEC also demonstrated its robustness and superiority than traditional deep learning methods. This work presents a neural operator regression architecture for predicting the 4D temporal-spatial ionospheric parameter for satellite navigation system performance, which may be further extended for various space applications and beyond.</p></details> |  |

Sharp-peaked likelihood functions commonly arise from millimeter-accurate distance observations of carrier phases in the global navigation satellite system (GNSS). However, when such likelihood functions are used for particle weight updates, the absence of particles within the peaks leads to all particle weights becoming zero. To overcome this problem, in this study, a straightforward and effective approach is introduced for updating particles when dealing with sharp-peaked likelihood functions obtained from multiple observations. The proposed method, termed as the multiple update PF, leverages prior knowledge regarding the spread of distribution for each likelihood function and conducts weight updates and resampling iteratively in the particle update process, prioritizing the likelihood function spreads. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method, particularly when applied to position estimation utilizing GNSS pseudorange and carrier phase observations. The multiple update PF exhibits faster convergence with fewer particles when compared to the conventional PF. Moreover, vehicle position estimation experiments conducted in urban environments reveal that the proposed method outperforms conventional GNSS positioning techniques, yielding more accurate position estimates.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 2024 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA 2024)</p></details> |

Heuristic methods are commonly used to estimate these errors and reduce the impact of noisy measurements on localization accuracy. In our work, we replace these error estimation heuristics with a deep learning model based on Graph Neural Networks. Additionally, by analyzing the cost function of the multilateration process, we derive an optimal method to utilize the estimated errors. Our approach guarantees that the multilateration converges to the receiver's location as the error estimation accuracy increases. We evaluate our solution on a real-world dataset containing more than 100k GNSS epochs, collected from multiple cities with diverse characteristics. The empirical results show improvements from 40% to 80% in the horizontal localization error against recent deep learning baselines as well as classical localization approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in The Proceedings of the Institute of Navigation GNSS+ 2023</p></details> |

Recently emerged, vision-based navigation has been a promising and feasible alternative to GNSS-based navigation. However, existing vision-based techniques are inadequate in addressing flight deviation caused by environmental disturbances and inaccurate position predictions in practical settings. In this paper, we present a novel angle robustness navigation paradigm to deal with flight deviation in point-to-point navigation tasks. Additionally, we propose a model that includes the Adaptive Feature Enhance Module, Cross-knowledge Attention-guided Module and Robust Task-oriented Head Module to accurately predict direction angles for high-precision navigation. To evaluate the vision-based navigation methods, we collect a new dataset termed as UAV_AR368. Furthermore, we design the Simulation Flight Testing Instrument (SFTI) using Google Earth to simulate different flight environments, thereby reducing the expenses associated with real flight testing. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art by achieving improvements of 26.0% and 45.6% in the success rate of arrival under ideal and disturbed circumstances, respectively.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Mobile robot localization with GNSS multipath detection using pseudorange residuals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08054v1)** | 2024-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a novel positioning technique suitable for use in mobile robots in urban environments in which large global navigation satellite system (GNSS) positioning errors occur because of multipath signals. During GNSS positioning, the GNSS satellites that are obstructed by buildings emit reflection and diffraction signals, which are called non-line-of-sight (NLOS) multipath signals. These multipath signals cause major positioning errors. The key concept considered in this paper is the estimation of a user's position using the likelihood of the position hypotheses computed from the GNSS pseudoranges, consisting only of LOS signals based on the analysis of the pseudorange residuals. To determine the NLOS GNSS signals from the pseudorange residuals at the user's position, it is necessary to accurately determine the position before the computation of the pseudorange residuals. This problem is solved using a particle filter. We propose a likelihood estimation method using the Mahalanobis distance between the hypotheses of the user's position computed from only the LOS pseudoranges and the particles. To confirm the effectiveness of the proposed technique, a positioning test was performed in a real-world urban environment. The results demonstrated that the proposed method is effective for accurately estimating the user's position in urban canyons.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an electronic version of an article published in ADVANCED ROBOTICS, 33(12):602-613, 2019.

To collect data, a vehicle equipped with a GNSS receiver, along with Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) is used. The detection framework incorporates two strategies: The first strategy involves comparing the predicted location shift, which is the distance traveled between two consecutive timestamps, with the inertial sensor-based location shift. For this purpose, data from low-cost in-vehicle inertial sensors such as the accelerometer and gyroscope sensor are fused and fed into a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network. The second strategy employs a Random-Forest supervised machine learning model to detect and classify turns, distinguishing between left and right turns using the output from the steering angle sensor. In experiments, two types of spoofing attack models: turn-by-turn and wrong turn are simulated. These spoofing attacks are modeled as SQL injection attacks, where, upon successful implementation, the navigation system perceives injected spoofed location information as legitimate while being unable to detect legitimate GNSS signals. Importantly, the IMU data remains uncompromised throughout the spoofing attack. To test the effectiveness of the detection framework, experiments are conducted in Tuscaloosa, AL, mimicking urban road structures. The results demonstrate the framework's ability to detect various sophisticated GNSS spoofing attacks, even including slow position drifting attacks. Overall, the experimental results showcase the robustness and efficacy of the sensor fusion-based spoofing attack detection approach in safeguarding AVs against GNSS spoofing threats.</p></details> |  |

To train the MLP, we carefully calculate the target values of pseudorange bias using location ground truth and smoothing techniques and optimize a loss function involving the estimation residuals of smartphone clock bias. The corrected pseudoranges are then used by a model-based localization engine to compute locations. The Google Smartphone Decimeter Challenge (GSDC) dataset, which contains Android smartphone data collected from both rural and urban areas, is utilized for evaluation. Both fingerprinting and cross-trace localization results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms model-based and state-of-the-art data-driven approaches.</p></details> |  |

Various GNSS/inertial measurement unit (IMU) integration methods have been proposed to improve the accuracy and availability of GNSS positioning. However, all these methods require the addition of a 3D attitude to the estimated state to fuse the IMU data. In this study, we propose a new optimization-based positioning method for combining GNSS and IMU that does not require attitude estimation. The proposed method uses two types of constraints: one is a constraint between states using only the magnitude of the 3D acceleration observed by an accelerometer, and the other is a constraint on the angle between the velocity vectors using the angular change measured by a gyroscope. The evaluation results with the simulation data show that the proposed method maintains the position estimation accuracy even when the IMU mounting position error increases and improves the accuracy when the GNSS observations contain multipath errors or missing data. The proposed method could improve positioning accuracy in experiments using IMUs acquired in real environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)</p></details> |

This method using differential equations is very accurate for very small distances on the surface of the earth in the 1500km range of the Indian subcontinent satellite coverage. When we talk of accuracy of the GPS system it should be very accurate on the surface of the earth when used to show changes in coordinate of the moving body with respect to the ground by the satellite which is situated on the earths orbit. Optical flow is a method which uses movements with respect to x and y axis for infinitesimal changes in its coordinates and then uses this algorithm to use it in global positioning system to find accurate position of the body with respect to the satellite coordinates with respect to ground positioning. The modern method of differential frames is also very accurate as it involves infinitesimal frames which are modelled together from the satellite to find changes in the coordinates on the earths surface, so we have designed a new algorithm in this paper on the Optical flow GNSS system which is an alternative and can improve the study done in the design of these algorithms in this field of applications.</p></details> |  |

We focus on the automatic operation of articulated six-wheel dump trucks at construction sites. For the automatic operation of the dump trucks, it is important to estimate the position and the articulated angle of the dump trucks with high accuracy. In this study, we propose a method for estimating the state of a dump truck by using four global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs) installed on an articulated dump truck and a graph optimization method that utilizes the redundancy of multiple GNSSs. By adding real-time kinematic (RTK)-GNSS constraints and geometric constraints between the four antennas, the proposed method can robustly estimate the position and articulation angle even in environments where GNSS satellites are partially blocked. As a result of evaluating the accuracy of the proposed method through field tests, it was confirmed that the articulated angle could be estimated with an accuracy of 0.1$^\circ$ in an open-sky environment and 0.7$^\circ$ in a mountainous area simulating an elevation angle of 45$^\circ$ where GNSS satellites are blocked.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an electronic version of an article published in ADVANCED ROBOTICS, 35:23, 1376-1387, 2021.

| **[Robust UAV Position and Attitude Estimation using Multiple GNSS Receivers for Laser-based 3D Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02485v1)** | 2023-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Small-sized unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely investigated for use in a variety of applications such as remote sensing and aerial surveying. Direct three-dimensional (3D) mapping using a small-sized UAV equipped with a laser scanner is required for numerous remote sensing applications. In direct 3D mapping, the precise information about the position and attitude of the UAV is necessary for constructing 3D maps. In this study, we propose a novel and robust technique for estimating the position and attitude of small-sized UAVs by employing multiple low-cost and light-weight global navigation satellite system (GNSS) antennas/receivers. Using the "redundancy" of multiple GNSS receivers, we enhance the performance of real-time kinematic (RTK)-GNSS by employing single-frequency GNSS receivers. This method consists of two approaches: hybrid GNSS fix solutions and consistency examination of the GNSS signal strength. The fix rate of RTK-GNSS using single-frequency GNSS receivers can be highly enhanced to combine multiple RTK-GNSS to fix solutions in the multiple antennas. In addition, positioning accuracy and fix rate can be further enhanced to detect multipath signals by using multiple GNSS antennas. In this study, we developed a prototype UAV that is equipped with six GNSS antennas/receivers. From the static test results, we conclude that the proposed technique can enhance the accuracy of the position and attitude estimation in multipath environments. From the flight test, the proposed system could generate a 3D map with an accuracy of 5 cm.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) 2019</p></details> |

The global navigation satellite system (GNSS) has recently been used to estimate the absolute 3D position of outdoor mobile robots. However, since the accuracy of GNSS single-point positioning is only a few meters, the GNSS is not used for the loop closure of a pose graph. The main purpose of this study is to generate a loop closure of a pose graph using a time-relative real-time kinematic GNSS (TR-RTK-GNSS) technique. The proposed TR-RTK-GNSS technique uses time-differential carrier phase positioning, which is based on carrier-phase-based differential GNSS with a single GNSS receiver. Unlike a conventional RTK-GNSS, we can directly compute the robot's relative position using only a stand-alone GNSS receiver. The initial pose graph is generated from the accumulated velocity computed from GNSS Doppler measurements. To reduce the accumulated error of velocity, we use the TR-RTK-GNSS technique for the loop closure in the graph-based optimization framework. The kinematic positioning tests were performed using an unmanned aerial vehicle to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed technique. From the tests, we can estimate the vehicle's trajectory with approximately 3 cm accuracy using only a stand-alone GNSS receiver.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L) and presented at the IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), 2020</p></details> |
| **[GNSS Odometry: Precise Trajectory Estimation Based on Carrier Phase Cycle Slip Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02424v1)** | 2023-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a highly accurate trajectory estimation method for outdoor mobile robots using global navigation satellite system (GNSS) time differences of carrier phase (TDCP) measurements. By using GNSS TDCP, the relative 3D position can be estimated with millimeter precision. However, when a phenomenon called cycle slip occurs, wherein the carrier phase measurement jumps and becomes discontinuous, it is impossible to accurately estimate the relative position using TDCP. Although previous studies have eliminated the effect of cycle slip using a robust optimization technique, it was difficult to completely eliminate the effect of outliers. In this paper, we propose a method to detect GNSS carrier phase cycle slip, estimate the amount of cycle slip, and modify the observed TDCP to calculate the relative position using the factor graph optimization framework. The estimated relative position acts as a loop closure in graph optimization and contributes to the reduction in the integration error of the relative position. Experiments with an unmanned aerial vehicle showed that by modifying the cycle slip using the proposed method, the vehicle trajectory could be estimated with an accuracy of 5 to 30 cm using only a single GNSS receiver, without using any other external data or sensors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L) and presented at the IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), 2022</p></details> |
| **[Clifford Algebra-Based Iterated Extended Kalman Filter with Application to Low-Cost INS/GNSS Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07049v2)** | 2023-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The traditional GNSS-aided inertial navigation system (INS) usually exploits the extended Kalman filter (EKF) for state estimation, and the initial attitude accuracy is key to the filtering performance. To spare the reliance on the initial attitude, this work generalizes the previously proposed trident quaternion within the framework of Clifford algebra to represent the extended pose, IMU biases and lever arms on the Lie group. Consequently, a quasi-group-affine system is established for the low-cost INS/GNSS integrated navigation system, and the right-error Clifford algebra-based EKF (Clifford-RQEKF) is accordingly developed. The iterated filtering approach is further applied to significantly improve the performances of the Clifford-RQEKF and the previously proposed trident quaternion-based EKFs. Numerical simulations and experiments show that all iterated filtering approaches fulfill the fast and global convergence without the prior attitude information, whereas the iterated Clifford-RQEKF performs much better than the others under especially large IMU biases.</p></details> |  |

In recent years, the integration of the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), Inertial Navigation System (INS), and camera has garnered considerable attention due to its robustness and high accuracy in diverse environments. However, leveraging the full capacity of GNSS is cumbersome because of the diverse choices of formulations, error models, satellite constellations, signal frequencies, and service types, which lead to different precision, robustness, and usage dependencies. To clarify the capacity of GNSS algorithms and accelerate the development efficiency of employing GNSS in multi-sensor fusion algorithms, we open source the GNSS/INS/Camera Integration Library (GICI-LIB), together with detailed documentation and a comprehensive land vehicle dataset. A factor graph optimization-based multi-sensor fusion framework is established, which combines almost all GNSS measurement error sources by fully considering temporal and spatial correlations between measurements. The graph structure is designed for flexibility, making it easy to form any kind of integration algorithm. For illustration, Real-Time Kinematic (RTK), Precise Point Positioning (PPP), and four RTK-based algorithms from GICI-LIB are evaluated using our dataset and public datasets. Results confirm the potential of the GICI system to provide continuous precise navigation solutions in a wide spectrum of urban environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Open-...</summary><p>Open-source: https://github.com/chichengcn/gici-open.

It can lead to loss of assets, inaccurate fare estimation, enforcing the wrong speed limit, miscalculated toll tax, passengers reaching an incorrect location, etc. The techniques designed to prevent and detect spoofing by using cryptographic solutions or receivers capable of differentiating legitimate and attack signals are insufficient in detecting GNSS spoofing of road users. Recent studies, testbeds, and 3GPP standards are exploring the possibility of hybrid positioning, where GNSS data will be combined with the 5G-NR positioning to increase the security and accuracy of positioning. We design the Location Estimation and Recovery(LER) systems to estimate the correct absolute position using the combination of GNSS and 5G positioning with other road users, where a subset of road users can be malicious and collude to prevent spoofing detection. Our Location Verification Protocol extends the understanding of Message Time of Arrival Codes (MTAC) to prevent attacks against malicious provers. The novel Recovery and Meta Protocol uses road users' dynamic and unpredictable nature to detect GNSS spoofing. This protocol provides fast detection of GNSS spoofing with a very low rate of false positives and can be customized to a large family of settings. Even in a (highly unrealistic) worst-case scenario where each user is malicious with a probability of as large as 0.3, our protocol detects GNSS spoofing with high probability after communication and ranging with at most 20 road users, with a false positive rate close to 0. SUMO simulations for road traffic show that we can detect GNSS spoofing in 2.6 minutes since its start under moderate traffic conditions.</p></details> |  |

Traditional state-of-the-art estimation methods, e.g., the multiplicative Kalman filter (MEKF), have some limitations concerning their consistency, errors in the initial state estimate, and convergence performance. Symmetry-based methods, such as the equivariant filter (EqF), offer significant advantages for these points by exploiting the mathematical properties of the system - its symmetry. These filters yield faster convergence rates and robustness to wrong initial state estimates through their error definition. To demonstrate the usability of EqFs, we focus on the sensor-fusion problem with the most common sensors in outdoor robotics: global navigation satellite system (GNSS) sensors and an inertial measurement unit (IMU). We provide an implementation of such an EqF leveraging the semi-direct product of the symmetry group to derive the filter equations. To validate the practical usability of EqFs in real-world scenarios, we evaluate our method using data from all outdoor runs of the INSANE Dataset. Our results demonstrate the performance improvements of the EqF in real-world environments, highlighting its potential for enhancing state estimation for UAVs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pre-p...</summary><p>Pre-print version, accepted to IEEE ICAR 2023</p></details> |

To address this need, we present a novel multi-LiDAR dataset specifically designed for UAV tracking. Our dataset includes data from a spinning LiDAR, two solid-state LiDARs with different Field of View (FoV) and scan patterns, and an RGB-D camera. This diverse sensor suite allows for research on new challenges in the field, including limited FoV adaptability and multi-modality data processing. The dataset facilitates the evaluation of existing algorithms and the development of new ones, paving the way for advances in UAV tracking techniques. Notably, we provide data in both indoor and outdoor environments. We also consider variable UAV sizes, from micro-aerial vehicles to more standard commercial UAV platforms. The outdoor trajectories are selected with close proximity to buildings, targeting research in UAV detection in urban areas, e.g., within counter-UAV systems or docking for UAV logistics. In addition to the dataset, we provide a baseline comparison with recent LiDAR-based UAV tracking algorithms, benchmarking the performance with different sensors, UAVs, and algorithms. Importantly, our dataset shows that current methods have shortcomings and are unable to track UAVs consistently across different scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning-based NLOS Detection and Uncertainty Prediction of GNSS Observations with Transformer-Enhanced LSTM Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00480v2)** | 2023-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) play a vital role in transport systems for accurate and consistent vehicle localization. However, GNSS observations can be distorted due to multipath effects and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) receptions in challenging environments such as urban canyons. In such cases, traditional methods to classify and exclude faulty GNSS observations may fail, leading to unreliable state estimation and unsafe system operations. This work proposes a deep-learning-based method to detect NLOS receptions and predict GNSS pseudorange errors by analyzing GNSS observations as a spatio-temporal modeling problem. Compared to previous works, we construct a transformer-like attention mechanism to enhance the long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, improving model performance and generalization. For the training and evaluation of the proposed network, we used labeled datasets from the cities of Hong Kong and Aachen. We also introduce a dataset generation process to label the GNSS observations using lidar maps. In experimental studies, we compare the proposed network with a deep-learning-based model and classical machine-learning models. Furthermore, we conduct ablation studies of our network components and integrate the NLOS detection with data out-of-distribution in a state estimator. As a result, our network presents improved precision and recall ratios compared to other models. Additionally, we show that the proposed method avoids trajectory divergence in real-world vehicle localization by classifying and excluding NLOS observations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for the IEEE ITSC2023</p></details> |

In parallel to boosting the transition to zero-carbon cars, there is an increasing interest in low-cost instruments for precise measurement of the environmental impact of the many internal combustion engine vehicles still in circulation. The main contribution of this work is the design and comparison of two innovative black-box algorithms, one based on a reduced complexity physics modeling while the other relying on a feedforward neural network for black-box fuel consumption estimation using only velocity and acceleration measurements. Based on suitable metrics, the developed algorithms outperform the state of the art best approach, both in the instantaneous and in the integral fuel consumption estimation, with errors smaller than 1\% with respect to the fuel flow ground truth. The data used for model identification, testing, and experimental validation is composed of GNSS velocity and IMU acceleration measurements collected during several trips using a diesel fuel vehicle on different roads, in different seasons, and with varying numbers of passengers. Compared to built-in vehicle monitoring systems, this methodology is not customized, uses off-the-shelf sensors, and is based on two simple algorithms that have been validated offline and could be easily implemented in a real-time environment.</p></details> |  |

However, conducting real-time forest inventory in large-scale and GNSS-interrupted forest environments has long been a formidable challenge. In this paper, we present a novel solution that leverages robotics and sensor-fusion technologies to overcome these challenges and enable real-time forest inventory with higher accuracy and efficiency. The proposed solution consists of a new SLAM algorithm to create an accurate 3D map of large-scale forest stands with detailed estimation about the number of trees and the corresponding DBH, solely with the consecutive scans of a 3D lidar and an imu. This method utilized a hierarchical unsupervised clustering algorithm to detect the trees and measure the DBH from the lidar point cloud. The algorithm can run simultaneously as the data is being recorded or afterwards on the recorded dataset. Furthermore, due to the proposed fast feature extraction and transform estimation modules, the recorded data can be fed to the SLAM with higher frequency than common SLAM algorithms. The performance of the proposed solution was tested through filed data collection with hand-held sensor platform as well as a mobile forestry robot. The accuracy of the results was also compared to the state-of-the-art SLAM solutions.</p></details> |  |

Yet, at low vehicle speeds (less than 2m/s) such a model-based heading measurement fails to provide satisfactory performance. This paper proposes GHNet, a deep-learning framework capable of accurately regressing the heading angle for vehicles operating at low speeds.

The goal is to enable accurate mapping and long-range navigation with practical applications in domains such as autonomous construction, military engineering missions, and exploration of non-Earth planets. The proposed system - Terrain-Referenced Assured Engineer Localization System (TRAELS) - integrates pose estimates produced by two complementary terrain referenced navigation (TRN) methods with wheel odometry and inertial measurement unit (IMU) measurements using an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). Unlike simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) systems that require loop closures, the described approach maintains accuracy over long distances and one-way missions without the need to revisit previous positions. Evaluation of TRAELS is performed across a range of environments. In regions where a combination of distinctive geometric and ground surface features are present, the developed TRN methods are leveraged by TRAELS to consistently achieve an absolute trajectory error of less than 3.0 m. The approach is also shown to be capable of recovering from large accumulated drift when traversing feature-sparse areas, which is essential in ensuring robust performance of the system across a wide variety of challenging GNSS-denied environments. Overall, the effectiveness of the system in providing precise localization and mapping capabilities in challenging GNSS-denied environments is demonstrated and an analysis is performed leading to insights for improving TRN approaches for UGVs.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 9 figures, 2 tables, to be published in The Proceedings of the Institute of Navigation GNSS+ 2023 conference (ION GNSS+ 23)</p></details> |
| **[A LiDAR-Inertial SLAM Tightly-Coupled with Dropout-Tolerant GNSS Fusion for Autonomous Mine Service Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11492v1)** | 2023-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-modal sensor integration has become a crucial prerequisite for the real-world navigation systems. Recent studies have reported successful deployment of such system in many fields. However, it is still challenging for navigation tasks in mine scenes due to satellite signal dropouts, degraded perception, and observation degeneracy. To solve this problem, we propose a LiDAR-inertial odometry method in this paper, utilizing both Kalman filter and graph optimization. The front-end consists of multiple parallel running LiDAR-inertial odometries, where the laser points, IMU, and wheel odometer information are tightly fused in an error-state Kalman filter. Instead of the commonly used feature points, we employ surface elements for registration. The back-end construct a pose graph and jointly optimize the pose estimation results from inertial, LiDAR odometry, and global navigation satellite system (GNSS). Since the vehicle has a long operation time inside the tunnel, the largely accumulated drift may be not fully by the GNSS measurements. We hereby leverage a loop closure based re-initialization process to achieve full alignment. In addition, the system robustness is improved through handling data loss, stream consistency, and estimation error. The experimental results show that our system has a good tolerance to the long-period degeneracy with the cooperation different LiDARs and surfel registration, achieving meter-level accuracy even for tens of minutes running during GNSS dropouts.</p></details> |  |

Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) methods inevitably accumulate drift on exploratory trajectories and primarily rely on place revisiting and loop closing to keep a bounded global localization error. Loop closure techniques are significantly challenging in agricultural fields, as the local visual appearance of different views is very similar and might change easily due to weather effects. A suitable alternative in practice is to employ global sensor positioning systems jointly with the rest of the robot sensors. In this paper we propose and implement the fusion of global navigation satellite system (GNSS), stereo views, and inertial measurements for localization purposes. Specifically, we incorporate, in a tightly coupled manner, GNSS measurements into the stereo-inertial ORB-SLAM3 pipeline. We thoroughly evaluate our implementation in the sequences of the Rosario data set, recorded by an autonomous robot in soybean fields, and our own in-house data. Our data includes measurements from a conventional GNSS, rarely included in evaluations of state-of-the-art approaches. We characterize the performance of GNSS-stereo-inertial SLAM in this application case, reporting pose error reductions between 10% and 30% compared to visual-inertial and loosely coupled GNSS-stereo-inertial baselines. In addition to such analysis, we also release the code of our implementation as open source.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication in Journal of Field Robotics, 2023</p></details> |

The algorithm is tested with real hardware in a video motion capture facility and a Robot Operating System (ROS) based simulation environment for unmanned ground vehicles (UGV). Both simulation and real-world experiments are performed to show the effectiveness of using ZU in one robot to reinstate the localization of other robots in a multi-robot system.

| **[RNN-Based GNSS Positioning using Satellite Measurement Features and Pseudorange Residuals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05319v1)** | 2023-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) context, the growing number of available satellites has lead to many challenges when it comes to choosing the most accurate pseudorange contributions, given the strong impact of biased measurements on positioning accuracy, particularly in single-epoch scenarios. This work leverages the potential of machine learning in predicting link-wise measurement quality factors and, hence, optimize measurement weighting. For this purpose, we use a customized matrix composed of heterogeneous features such as conditional pseudorange residuals and per-link satellite metrics (e.g., carrier-to-noise power density ratio and its empirical statistics, satellite elevation, carrier phase lock time). This matrix is then fed as an input to a recurrent neural network (RNN) (i.e., a long-short term memory (LSTM) network). Our experimental results on real data, obtained from extensive field measurements, demonstrate the high potential of our proposed solution being able to outperform traditional measurements weighting and selection strategies from state-of-the-art.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Smoothing Using GNSS/PDR Integration Via Factor Graph Optimization in Urban Canyons](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14264v2)** | 2023-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and smooth global navigation satellite system (GNSS) positioning for pedestrians in urban canyons is still a challenge due to the multipath effects and the non-light-of-sight (NLOS) receptions caused by the reflections from surrounding buildings. The recently developed factor graph optimization (FGO) based GNSS positioning method opened a new window for improving urban GNSS positioning by effectively exploiting the measurement redundancy from the historical information to resist the outlier measurements. Unfortunately, the FGO-based GNSS standalone positioning is still challenged in highly urbanized areas. As an extension of the previous FGO-based GNSS positioning method, this paper exploits the potential of the pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) model in FGO to improve the GNSS standalone positioning performance in urban canyons. Specifically, the relative motion of the pedestrian is estimated based on the raw acceleration measurements from the onboard smartphone inertial measurement unit (IMU) via the PDR algorithm. Then the raw GNSS pseudorange, Doppler measurements, and relative motion from PDR are integrated using the FGO. Given the context of pedestrian navigation with a small acceleration most of the time, a novel soft motion model is proposed to smooth the states involved in the factor graph model. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified step-by-step through two datasets collected in dense urban canyons of Hong Kong using smartphone-level GNSS receivers. The comparison between the conventional extended Kalman filter, several existing methods, and FGO-based integration is presented. The results reveal that the existing FGO-based GNSS standalone positioning is highly complementary to the PDR's relative motion estimation. Both improved positioning accuracy and trajectory smoothness are obtained with the help of the proposed method.</p></details> | 11 pages, 14 figures |

However, civilian GNSS signals are usually not cryptographically protected. This makes attacks that forge signals relatively easy. Considering modern devices often have network connections and onboard sensors, the proposed here Probabilistic Detection of GNSS Spoofing (PDS) scheme is based on such opportunistic information. PDS has at its core two parts. First, a regression problem with motion model constraints, which equalizes the noise of all locations considering the motion model of the device. Second, a Gaussian process, that analyzes statistical properties of location data to construct uncertainty. Then, a likelihood function, that fuses the two parts, as a basis for a Neyman-Pearson lemma (NPL)-based detection strategy. Our experimental evaluation shows a performance gain over the state-of-the-art, in terms of attack detection effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

GNSS receivers, as part of the encompassing platform, can leverage external information to detect GNSS attacks. Specifically, cross-checking the time produced by the GNSS receiver against multiple trusted time sources can provide robust and assured PNT. In this work, we explore the combination of secure remote, network-based time providers and local precision oscillators. This multi-layered defense mechanism detects GNSS attacks that induce even small time offsets, including attacks mounted in cold start. Our system does not require any modification to the current structure of the GNSS receiver, it is agnostic to the satellite constellation and the attacker type. This makes time-based data validation of GNSS information compatible with existing receivers and readily deployable.</p></details> | <details><summary>In pr...</summary><p>In proceedings of the 2023 IEEE/ION Position Navigation and Localization Symposium (PLANS)</p></details> |

The state estimation and its protection-level generation often suffer from satellite-signal disturbances in urban environments and subsequent poor parametrization of the satellite observables. Thus, we propose an innovative scheme involving an extended H_infinity filter (EHF) for robust state estimation and zonotope for the protection-level generation. This scheme is shown as part of a tightly coupled navigation system based on an inertial navigation system and aided by the GPS/Galileo dual-constellation satellite navigation system. Specifically, GNSS pseudorange and deltarange observables are utilized. The experimental results of post-processing a real-world dataset show significant advantages of EHF against a conventional extended Kalman filter regarding the navigation accuracy and robustness under various GNSS-measurement parametrizations and environmental circumstances. The zonotope-based protection-level calculation is proven valid, computationally affordable, and feasible for real-time implementations.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work is published in Springer Nature GPS Solutions: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10291-023-01447-z</p></details> |

We present a novel semantic SLAM approach that leverages road elements such as lane boundaries, traffic signs, and road markings to enhance localization accuracy. Our system integrates real-time semantic feature detection with a graph optimization framework, effectively handling both rolling-shutter effects and INS drift. Using a practical hardware setup which consists of a rolling-shutter camera (3840*2160@30fps), IMU (100Hz), and wheel encoder (50Hz), we demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods. Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, our method achieves higher recall (up to 5.35\%) and precision (up to 2.79\%) in semantic element detection, while maintaining mean relative error (MRE) within 10cm and mean absolute error (MAE) around 1m. Extensive experiments in diverse urban environments demonstrate the robust performance of our system under varying lighting conditions and complex traffic scenarios, making it particularly suitable for autonomous driving applications. The proposed approach provides a practical solution for high-precision localization using affordable hardware, bridging the gap between consumer-grade sensors and production-level performance requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE IV'25</p></details> |

Calibrating UWB anchors manually can be time-consuming and even impossible in emergencies or those situations without special calibration tools. Therefore, automatic estimation of the anchor positions becomes a necessity. The proposed method enables the creation of a soft sensor providing the position information of the anchors in a UWB network. This soft sensor requires only UWB and LiDAR measurements measured from a moving robot. The proposed FGO framework is suitable for the calibration of an extendable large UWB network. Moreover, the anchor calibration problem and robot localization problem can be solved simultaneously, which saves time for UWB network deployment. The proposed framework also helps to avoid artificial errors in the UWB-anchor position estimation and improves the accuracy and robustness of the robot-pose. The experimental results of the robot localization using LiDAR and a UWB network in a 3D environment are discussed, demonstrating the performance of the proposed method. More specifically, the anchor calibration problem with four anchors and the robot localization problem can be solved simultaneously and automatically within 30 seconds by the proposed framework.

However, dense point clouds face challenges of high memory consumption and reduced maintainability for long-term operations. In this study, we introduce SLIM, a scalable and lightweight mapping system for long-term LiDAR mapping in urban environments. The system begins by parameterizing structural point clouds into lines and planes. These lightweight and structural representations meet the requirements of map merging, pose graph optimization, and bundle adjustment, ensuring incremental management and local consistency. For long-term operations, a map-centric nonlinear factor recovery method is designed to sparsify poses while preserving mapping accuracy. We validate the SLIM system with multi-session real-world LiDAR data from classical LiDAR mapping datasets, including KITTI, NCLT, HeLiPR and M2DGR. The experiments demonstrate its capabilities in mapping accuracy, lightweightness, and scalability. Map re-use is also verified through map-based robot localization. Finally, with multi-session LiDAR data, the SLIM system provides a globally consistent map with low memory consumption (~130 KB/km on KITTI).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Robotics.

| **[DynOPETs: A Versatile Benchmark for Dynamic Object Pose Estimation and Tracking in Moving Camera Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19625v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the realm of object pose estimation, scenarios involving both dynamic objects and moving cameras are prevalent. However, the scarcity of corresponding real-world datasets significantly hinders the development and evaluation of robust pose estimation models. This is largely attributed to the inherent challenges in accurately annotating object poses in dynamic scenes captured by moving cameras. To bridge this gap, this paper presents a novel dataset DynOPETs and a dedicated data acquisition and annotation pipeline tailored for object pose estimation and tracking in such unconstrained environments. Our efficient annotation method innovatively integrates pose estimation and pose tracking techniques to generate pseudo-labels, which are subsequently refined through pose graph optimization. The resulting dataset offers accurate pose annotations for dynamic objects observed from moving cameras. To validate the effectiveness and value of our dataset, we perform comprehensive evaluations using 18 state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its potential to accelerate research in this challenging domain. The dataset will be made publicly available to facilitate further exploration and advancement in the field.</p></details> |  |
| **[MCVO: A Generic Visual Odometry for Arbitrarily Arranged Multi-Cameras](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03146v2)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Making multi-camera visual SLAM systems easier to set up and more robust to the environment is attractive for vision robots. Existing monocular and binocular vision SLAM systems have narrow sensing Field-of-View (FoV), resulting in degenerated accuracy and limited robustness in textureless environments. Thus multi-camera SLAM systems are gaining attention because they can provide redundancy with much wider FoV. However, the usual arbitrary placement and orientation of multiple cameras make the pose scale estimation and system updating challenging. To address these problems, we propose a robust visual odometry system for rigidly-bundled arbitrarily-arranged multi-cameras, namely MCVO, which can achieve metric-scale state estimation with high flexibility in the cameras' arrangement. Specifically, we first design a learning-based feature tracking framework to shift the pressure of CPU processing of multiple video streams to GPU. Then we initialize the odometry system with the metric-scale poses under the rigid constraints between moving cameras. Finally, we fuse the features of the multi-cameras in the back-end to achieve robust pose estimation and online scale optimization. Additionally, multi-camera features help improve the loop detection for pose graph optimization. Experiments on KITTI-360 and MultiCamData datasets validate its robustness over arbitrarily arranged cameras. Compared with other stereo and multi-camera visual SLAM systems, our method obtains higher pose accuracy with better generalization ability. Our codes and online demos are available at https://github.com/JunhaoWang615/MCVO</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |

We argue that latent codes stored in many NeRF SLAM systems are not fully exploited, as they are only used for better reconstruction. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective way to detect potential loops using the same latent codes as local features. To further improve the loop detection performance, we use the semantic information, which are also decoded from the same latent codes to guide the aggregation of local features. Finally, with the potential loops detected, we close them with a graph optimization followed by bundle adjustment to refine both the estimated poses and the reconstructed scene. To evaluate the performance of our SLC$^2$-SLAM, we conduct extensive experiments on Replica and ScanNet datasets. Our proposed semantic-guided loop closure significantly outperforms the pre-trained NetVLAD and ORB combined with Bag-of-Words, which are used in all the other NeRF SLAM with loop closure. As a result, our SLC$^2$-SLAM also demonstrated better tracking and reconstruction performance, especially in larger scenes with more loops, like ScanNet.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to RAL. 8 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[BRIGHT-VO: Brightness-Guided Hybrid Transformer for Visual Odometry with Multi-modality Refinement Module](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08659v3)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual odometry (VO) plays a crucial role in autonomous driving, robotic navigation, and other related tasks by estimating the position and orientation of a camera based on visual input. Significant progress has been made in data-driven VO methods, particularly those leveraging deep learning techniques to extract image features and estimate camera poses. However, these methods often struggle in low-light conditions because of the reduced visibility of features and the increased difficulty of matching keypoints. To address this limitation, we introduce BrightVO, a novel VO model based on Transformer architecture, which not only performs front-end visual feature extraction, but also incorporates a multi-modality refinement module in the back-end that integrates Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data. Using pose graph optimization, this module iteratively refines pose estimates to reduce errors and improve both accuracy and robustness. Furthermore, we create a synthetic low-light dataset, KiC4R, which includes a variety of lighting conditions to facilitate the training and evaluation of VO frameworks in challenging environments. Experimental results demonstrate that BrightVO achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the KiC4R dataset and the KITTI benchmarks. Specifically, it provides an average improvement of 20% in pose estimation accuracy in normal outdoor environments and 259% in low-light conditions, outperforming existing methods.

To overcome the shortcomings of standalone UWB systems in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios and the inherent drift associated with inertial navigation, we developed a novel hybrid fusion framework. First, a dynamic covariance estimation mechanism is incorporated, which automatically adjusts measurement weights based on real-time channel conditions. Then, a tightly-coupled sensor fusion architecture is employed, utilizing IMU pre-integration theory for temporal synchronization. Finally, a sliding-window factor graph optimization backend is utilized, incorporating NLOS mitigation constraints. Experimental results in complex indoor environments show a 38\% improvement in positioning accuracy compared to conventional Kalman filter-based approaches, achieving a 12.3 cm root mean square (RMS) error under dynamic motion conditions. The system maintains robust performance even with intermittent UWB signal availability, down to a 40\% packet reception rate, effectively suppressing IMU drift through multi-modal constraint fusion. This work offers a practical solution for applications that require reliable indoor positioning in GPS-denied environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[KISS-SLAM: A Simple, Robust, and Accurate 3D LiDAR SLAM System With Enhanced Generalization Capabilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12660v1)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust and accurate localization and mapping of an environment using laser scanners, so-called LiDAR SLAM, is essential to many robotic applications. Early 3D LiDAR SLAM methods often exploited additional information from IMU or GNSS sensors to enhance localization accuracy and mitigate drift. Later, advanced systems further improved the estimation at the cost of a higher runtime and complexity. This paper explores the limits of what can be achieved with a LiDAR-only SLAM approach while following the "Keep It Small and Simple" (KISS) principle. By leveraging this minimalistic design principle, our system, KISS-SLAM, archives state-of-the-art performances in pose accuracy while requiring little to no parameter tuning for deployment across diverse environments, sensors, and motion profiles. We follow best practices in graph-based SLAM and build upon LiDAR odometry to compute the relative motion between scans and construct local maps of the environment. To correct drift, we match local maps and optimize the trajectory in a pose graph optimization step. The experimental results demonstrate that this design achieves competitive performance while reducing complexity and reliance on additional sensor modalities. By prioritizing simplicity, this work provides a new strong baseline for LiDAR-only SLAM and a high-performing starting point for future research. Further, our pipeline builds consistent maps that can be used directly for further downstream tasks like navigation. Our open-source system operates faster than the sensor frame rate in all presented datasets and is designed for real-world scenarios.</p></details> | 8 pages |

Addressing these challenges, this paper introduces a novel, tightly-coupled Acoustic-Visual-Inertial SLAM approach, termed AQUA-SLAM, to fuse a Doppler Velocity Log (DVL), a stereo camera, and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) within a graph optimization framework. Moreover, we propose an efficient sensor calibration technique, encompassing multi-sensor extrinsic calibration (among the DVL, camera and IMU) and DVL transducer misalignment calibration, with a fast linear approximation procedure for real-time online execution. The proposed methods are extensively evaluated in a tank environment with ground truth, and validated for offshore applications in the North Sea. The results demonstrate that our method surpasses current state-of-the-art underwater and visual-inertial SLAM systems in terms of localization accuracy and robustness. The proposed system will be made open-source for the community.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Semantic Graphs for Efficient and Robust LiDAR SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11145v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and robust simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is crucial for autonomous mobile systems, typically achieved by leveraging the geometric features of the environment. Incorporating semantics provides a richer scene representation that not only enhances localization accuracy in SLAM but also enables advanced cognitive functionalities for downstream navigation and planning tasks. Existing point-wise semantic LiDAR SLAM methods often suffer from poor efficiency and generalization, making them less robust in diverse real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a semantic graph-enhanced SLAM framework, named SG-SLAM, which effectively leverages the geometric, semantic, and topological characteristics inherent in environmental structures. The semantic graph serves as a fundamental component that facilitates critical functionalities of SLAM, including robust relocalization during odometry failures, accurate loop closing, and semantic graph map construction. Our method employs a dual-threaded architecture, with one thread dedicated to online odometry and relocalization, while the other handles loop closure, pose graph optimization, and map update. This design enables our method to operate in real time and generate globally consistent semantic graph maps and point cloud maps. We extensively evaluate our method across the KITTI, MulRAN, and Apollo datasets, and the results demonstrate its superiority compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our method has been released at https://github.com/nubot-nudt/SG-SLAM.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Speedy MASt3R](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10017v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image matching is a key component of modern 3D vision algorithms, essential for accurate scene reconstruction and localization. MASt3R redefines image matching as a 3D task by leveraging DUSt3R and introducing a fast reciprocal matching scheme that accelerates matching by orders of magnitude while preserving theoretical guarantees. This approach has gained strong traction, with DUSt3R and MASt3R collectively cited over 250 times in a short span, underscoring their impact. However, despite its accuracy, MASt3R's inference speed remains a bottleneck. On an A40 GPU, latency per image pair is 198.16 ms, mainly due to computational overhead from the ViT encoder-decoder and Fast Reciprocal Nearest Neighbor (FastNN) matching. To address this, we introduce Speedy MASt3R, a post-training optimization framework that enhances inference efficiency while maintaining accuracy. It integrates multiple optimization techniques, including FlashMatch-an approach leveraging FlashAttention v2 with tiling strategies for improved efficiency, computation graph optimization via layer and tensor fusion having kernel auto-tuning with TensorRT (GraphFusion), and a streamlined FastNN pipeline that reduces memory access time from quadratic to linear while accelerating block-wise correlation scoring through vectorized computation (FastNN-Lite). Additionally, it employs mixed-precision inference with FP16/FP32 hybrid computations (HybridCast), achieving speedup while preserving numerical precision. Evaluated on Aachen Day-Night, InLoc, 7-Scenes, ScanNet1500, and MegaDepth1500, Speedy MASt3R achieves a 54% reduction in inference time (198 ms to 91 ms per image pair) without sacrificing accuracy. This advancement enables real-time 3D understanding, benefiting applications like mixed reality navigation and large-scale 3D scene reconstruction.</p></details> |  |
| **[MAC-VO: Metrics-aware Covariance for Learning-based Stereo Visual Odometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09479v2)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose the MAC-VO, a novel learning-based stereo VO that leverages the learned metrics-aware matching uncertainty for dual purposes: selecting keypoint and weighing the residual in pose graph optimization. Compared to traditional geometric methods prioritizing texture-affluent features like edges, our keypoint selector employs the learned uncertainty to filter out the low-quality features based on global inconsistency. In contrast to the learning-based algorithms that model the scale-agnostic diagonal weight matrix for covariance, we design a metrics-aware covariance model to capture the spatial error during keypoint registration and the correlations between different axes. Integrating this covariance model into pose graph optimization enhances the robustness and reliability of pose estimation, particularly in challenging environments with varying illumination, feature density, and motion patterns. On public benchmark datasets, MAC-VO outperforms existing VO algorithms and even some SLAM algorithms in challenging environments. The covariance map also provides valuable information about the reliability of the estimated poses, which can benefit decision-making for autonomous systems.</p></details> |  |

This paper addresses the distributed pose graph optimization (PGO) problem under non-convex constraints, with the goal of approximating the rotation and translation of each pose given relevant noisy measurements. To achieve this goal, the splitting method based on the concepts of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and Bregman iteration are applied to solve the rotation subproblems. The proposed approach enables the iterative resolution of constrained problems, achieved through solving unconstrained problems and orthogonality-constrained quadratic problems that have analytical solutions. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared against two practical methods in pose graph optimization: the Distributed Gauss-Seidel (DGS) algorithm and the centralized pose graph optimizer with an optimality certificate (SE-Sync). The efficiency of the proposed method is verified through its application to several simulated and real-world pose graph datasets. Unlike the DGS method, our approach attempts to solve distributed PGO problems without relaxing the non-convex constraints.</p></details> | 20 pages, 4 figures |

Its complexity, combined with the increasing scale of problems, underscores the need for efficient and effective algorithms. However, existing heuristic algorithms for MVC often rely on simplistic initialization strategies and overlook the impact of edge attributes and neighborhood information on vertex selection. In this paper, we introduce GCNIVC, a novel heuristic search algorithm designed to address the limitations of existing methods for solving MVC problems in large-scale graphs. Our approach features two main innovations. First, it utilizes a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to capture the global structure of graphs, which enables the generation of high-quality initial solutions that enhance the efficiency of the subsequent search process. Second, GCNIVC introduces a new heuristic that employs three containers and the concept of double-covered edges (dc-edges), improving search efficiency and providing greater flexibility for adding and removing operations based on edge attributes. Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that GCNIVC outperforms state-of-the-art MVC algorithms in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. Our results highlight the effectiveness of GCNIVC's GCN-assisted initialization and its edge-informed search strategy. This study not only advances the understanding of MVC problem-solving but also contributes a new tool for addressing large-scale graph optimization challenges.</p></details> |  |

We validate the proposed learning-based models using real-world sensor data collected in diverse urban environments. Experimental results demonstrate that both models effectively handle GNSS outliers and improve state estimation performance.

In the communication-constrained multi-agent setting, navigation systems increasingly use point-to-point range sensors as they afford measurements with low bandwidth requirements and known data association. The state estimation problem for these systems takes the form of range-aided (RA) SLAM. However, distributed algorithms for solving the RA-SLAM problem lack formal guarantees on the quality of the returned estimate. To this end, we present the first distributed algorithm for RA-SLAM that can efficiently recover certifiably globally optimal solutions. Our algorithm, distributed certifiably correct RA-SLAM (DCORA), achieves this via the Riemannian Staircase method, where computational procedures developed for distributed certifiably correct pose graph optimization are generalized to the RA-SLAM problem. We demonstrate DCORA's efficacy on real-world multi-agent datasets by achieving absolute trajectory errors comparable to those of a state-of-the-art centralized certifiably correct RA-SLAM algorithm. Additionally, we perform a parametric study on the structure of the RA-SLAM problem using synthetic data, revealing how common parameters affect DCORA's performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, accepted to 2025 International Conference on Robotics and Automation</p></details> |
| **[Impact of Temporal Delay on Radar-Inertial Odometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02509v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate ego-motion estimation is a critical component of any autonomous system. Conventional ego-motion sensors, such as cameras and LiDARs, may be compromised in adverse environmental conditions, such as fog, heavy rain, or dust. Automotive radars, known for their robustness to such conditions, present themselves as complementary sensors or a promising alternative within the ego-motion estimation frameworks. In this paper we propose a novel Radar-Inertial Odometry (RIO) system that integrates an automotive radar and an inertial measurement unit. The key contribution is the integration of online temporal delay calibration within the factor graph optimization framework that compensates for potential time offsets between radar and IMU measurements. To validate the proposed approach we have conducted thorough experimental analysis on real-world radar and IMU data. The results show that, even without scan matching or target tracking, integration of online temporal calibration significantly reduces localization error compared to systems that disregard time synchronization, thus highlighting the important role of, often neglected, accurate temporal alignment in radar-based sensor fusion systems for autonomous navigation.</p></details> |  |

Traditionally, these methods solve unconstrained least squares problems using algorithms such as Gauss-Newton and Levenberg-Marquardt. However, extending factor graphs with native support for equality constraints can improve solution accuracy and broaden their applicability, particularly in optimal control. In this paper, we propose a novel extension of factor graphs that seamlessly incorporates equality constraints without requiring additional optimization algorithms. Our approach maintains the efficiency and flexibility of existing second-order optimization techniques while ensuring constraint feasibility. To validate our method, we apply it to an optimal control problem for velocity tracking in autonomous vehicles and benchmark our results against state-of-the-art constraint handling techniques. Additionally, we introduce ecg2o, a header-only C++ library that extends the widely used g2o factor graph library by adding full support for equality-constrained optimization. This library, along with demonstrative examples and the optimal control problem, is available as open source at https://github.com/snt-arg/ecg2o</p></details> |  |

However, loop closure detection in large-scale missions presents significant computational challenges due to the need to identify, verify, and process numerous candidate pairs for pose graph optimization. Keyframe sampling bridges the front-end and back-end by selecting frames for storing and processing during global optimization. This article proposes an online keyframe sampling approach that constructs the pose graph using the most impactful keyframes for loop closure. We introduce the Minimal Subset Approach (MSA), which optimizes two key objectives: redundancy minimization and information preservation, implemented within a sliding window framework. By operating in the feature space rather than 3-D space, MSA efficiently reduces redundant keyframes while retaining essential information. In sum, evaluations on diverse public datasets show that the proposed approach outperforms naive methods in reducing false positive rates in place recognition, while delivering superior ATE and RPE in metric localization, without the need for manual parameter tuning. Additionally, MSA demonstrates efficiency and scalability by reducing memory usage and computational overhead during loop closure detection and pose graph optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 Figures, 2 Tables.

| **[OptiRefine: Densest subgraphs and maximum cuts with $k$ refinements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14532v2)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data-analysis tasks often involve an iterative process, which requires refining previous solutions. For instance, when analyzing dynamic social networks, we may be interested in monitoring the evolution of a community that was identified at an earlier snapshot. This task requires finding a community in the current snapshot of data that is ``close'' to the earlier-discovered community of interest. However, classic optimization algorithms, which typically find solutions from scratch, potentially return communities that are very dissimilar to the initial one. To mitigate these issues, we introduce the \emph{OptiRefine framework}. The framework optimizes initial solutions by making a small number of \emph{refinements}, thereby ensuring that the new solution remains close to the initial solution and simultaneously achieving a near-optimal solution for the optimization problem. We apply the OptiRefine framework to two classic graph-optimization problems: \emph{densest subgraph} and \emph{maximum cut}. For the \emph{densest-subgraph problem}, we optimize a given subgraph's density by adding or removing $k$~nodes. We show that this novel problem is a generalization of $k$-densest subgraph, and provide constant-factor approximation algorithms for $k=\Omega(n)$~refinements. We also study a version of \emph{maximum cut} in which the goal is to improve a given cut. We provide connections to maximum cut with cardinality constraints and provide an optimal approximation algorithm in most parameter regimes under the Unique Games Conjecture for $k=\Omega(n)$~refinements. We evaluate our theoretical methods and scalable heuristics on synthetic and real-world data and show that they are highly effective in practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted under review.

FGO exhibits superior estimation accuracy compared with traditional state estimation methods that rely on least-squares or Kalman filters. However, only a few FGO libraries are specialized for GNSS observations. This paper introduces an open-source GNSS FGO package named gtsam\_gnss, which has a simple structure and can be easily applied to GNSS research and development. This package separates the preprocessing of GNSS observations from factor optimization. Moreover, it describes the error function of the GNSS factor in a straightforward manner, allowing for general-purpose inputs. This design facilitates the transition from ordinary least-squares-based positioning to FGO and supports user-specific GNSS research. In addition, gtsam\_gnss includes analytical examples involving various factors using GNSS data in real urban environments. This paper presents three application examples: the use of a robust error model, estimation of integer ambiguity in the carrier phase, and combination of GNSS and inertial measurements from smartphones. The proposed framework demonstrates excellent state estimation performance across all use cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 2025 IEEE/ION Position, Location and Navigation Symposium (PLANS)</p></details> |

For wheeled robots, a wheel kinematic model (i.e., wheel odometry) can improve the reliability of the odometry estimation. However, the kinematic model suffers from complex motions (e.g., wheel slippage, lateral movement) in the case of skid-steering robots particularly because this robot model rotates by skidding its wheels. Furthermore, these errors change nonlinearly when the wheel slippage is large (e.g., drifting) and are subject to terrain-dependent parameters. To simultaneously tackle point cloud degeneration and the kinematic model errors, we developed a LiDAR-IMU-wheel odometry algorithm incorporating online training of a neural network that learns the kinematic model of wheeled robots with nonlinearity. We propose to train the neural network online on a factor graph along with robot states, allowing the learning-based kinematic model to adapt to the current terrain condition. The proposed method jointly solves online training of the neural network and LiDAR-IMU-wheel odometry on a unified factor graph to retain the consistency of all those constraints. Through experiments, we first verified that the proposed network adapted to a changing environment, resulting in an accurate odometry estimation across different environments. We then confirmed that the proposed odometry estimation algorithm was robust against point cloud degeneration and nonlinearity (e.g., large wheel slippage by drifting) of the kinematic model.

| **[Graph Optimality-Aware Stochastic LiDAR Bundle Adjustment with Progressive Spatial Smoothing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14565v2)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale LiDAR Bundle Adjustment (LBA) to refine sensor orientation and point cloud accuracy simultaneously to build the navigation map is a fundamental task in logistics and robotics. Unlike pose-graph-based methods that rely solely on pairwise relationships between LiDAR frames, LBA leverages raw LiDAR correspondences to achieve more precise results, especially when initial pose estimates are unreliable for low-cost sensors. However, existing LBA methods face challenges such as simplistic planar correspondences, extensive observations, and dense normal matrices in the least-squares problem, which limit robustness, efficiency, and scalability. To address these issues, we propose a Graph Optimality-aware Stochastic Optimization scheme with Progressive Spatial Smoothing, namely PSS-GOSO, to achieve \textit{robust}, \textit{efficient}, and \textit{scalable} LBA. The Progressive Spatial Smoothing (PSS) module extracts \textit{robust} LiDAR feature association exploiting the prior structure information obtained by the polynomial smooth kernel. The Graph Optimality-aware Stochastic Optimization (GOSO) module first sparsifies the graph according to optimality for an \textit{efficient} optimization. GOSO then utilizes stochastic clustering and graph marginalization to solve the large-scale state estimation problem for a \textit{scalable} LBA. We validate PSS-GOSO across diverse scenes captured by various platforms, demonstrating its superior performance compared to existing methods. Moreover, the resulting point cloud maps are used for automatic last-mile delivery in large-scale complex scenes.

Many SLAM systems have been proposed in the last decade, but they are often complex to adapt to different settings or sensor setups. In this work, we present LiDAR Graph-SLAM (LG-SLAM), a versatile range-inertial SLAM framework that can be adapted to different types of sensors and environments, from underground mines to offices with minimal parameter tuning. Our system integrates range, inertial and GNSS measurements into a graph-based optimization framework. We also use a refined submap management approach and a robust loop closure method that effectively accounts for uncertainty in the identification and validation of putative loop closures, ensuring global consistency and robustness. Enabled by a parallelized architecture and GPU integration, our system achieves pose estimation at LiDAR frame rate, along with online loop closing and graph optimization. We validate our system in diverse environments using public datasets and real-world data, consistently achieving an average error below 20 cm and outperforming other state-of-the-art algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

However, during the execution of a MAPF plan, agents may encounter unexpected delays, which can lead to inefficiencies, deadlocks, or even collisions. To address these issues, the Switchable Temporal Plan Graph provides a framework for finding an acyclic Temporal Plan Graph with the minimum execution cost under delays, ensuring deadlock- and collision-free execution. Unfortunately, existing optimal algorithms, such as Mixed Integer Linear Programming and Graph-Based Switchable Edge Search (GSES), are often too slow for practical use. This paper introduces Improved GSES, which significantly accelerates GSES through four speedup techniques: stronger admissible heuristics, edge grouping, prioritized branching, and incremental implementation. Experiments conducted on four different map types with varying numbers of agents demonstrate that Improved GSES consistently achieves over twice the success rate of GSES and delivers up to a 30-fold speedup on instances where both methods successfully find solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025.

In particular, it is crucial to plan a path to avoid risky terrain and reach the goal quickly and safely. In this paper, we propose a method for safe and distance-efficient path planning, leveraging Traversal Risk Graph (TRG), a novel graph representation that takes into account geometric traversability of the terrain. TRG nodes represent stability and reachability of the terrain, while edges represent relative traversal risk-weighted path candidates. Additionally, TRG is constructed in a wavefront propagation manner and managed hierarchically, enabling real-time planning even in large-scale environments. Lastly, we formulate a graph optimization problem on TRG that leads the robot to navigate by prioritizing both safe and short paths. Our approach demonstrated superior safety, distance efficiency, and fast processing time compared to the conventional methods. It was also validated in several real-world experiments using a quadrupedal robot. Notably, TRG-planner contributed as the global path planner of an autonomous navigation framework for the DreamSTEP team, which won the Quadruped Robot Challenge at ICRA 2023.

| **[Tightly Joined Positioning and Control Model for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Based on Factor Graph Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14724v2)** | 2024-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The execution of flight missions by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) primarily relies on navigation. In particular, the navigation pipeline has traditionally been divided into positioning and control, operating in a sequential loop. However, the existing navigation pipeline, where the positioning and control are decoupled, struggles to adapt to ubiquitous uncertainties arising from measurement noise, abrupt disturbances, and nonlinear dynamics. As a result, the navigation reliability of the UAV is significantly challenged in complex dynamic areas. For example, the ubiquitous global navigation satellite system (GNSS) positioning can be degraded by the signal reflections from surrounding high-rising buildings in complex urban areas, leading to significantly increased positioning uncertainty. An additional challenge is introduced to the control algorithm due to the complex wind disturbances in urban canyons. Given the fact that the system positioning and control are highly correlated with each other, this research proposes a **tightly joined positioning and control model (JPCM) based on factor graph optimization (FGO)**. In particular, the proposed JPCM combines sensor measurements from positioning and control constraints into a unified probabilistic factor graph. Specifically, the positioning measurements are formulated as the factors in the factor graph. In addition, the model predictive control (MPC) is also formulated as the additional factors in the factor graph. By solving the factor graph contributed by both the positioning-related factors and the MPC-based factors, the complementariness of positioning and control can be deeply exploited. Finally, we validate the effectiveness and resilience of the proposed method using a simulated quadrotor system which shows significantly improved trajectory following performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Guardians of the Ledger: Protecting Decentralized Exchanges from State Derailment Defects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18935v2)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The decentralized exchange (DEX) leverages smart contracts to trade digital assets for users on the blockchain. Developers usually develop several smart contracts into one project, implementing complex logic functions and multiple transaction operations. However, the interaction among these contracts poses challenges for developers analyzing the state logic. Due to the complex state logic in DEX projects, many critical state derailment defects have emerged in recent years. In this paper, we conduct the first systematic study of state derailment defects in DEX. We define five categories of state derailment defects and provide detailed analyses of them. Furthermore, we propose a novel deep learning-based framework StateGuard for detecting state derailment defects in DEX smart contracts. It leverages a smart contract deconstructor to deconstruct the contract into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), from which five categories of dependency features are extracted. Next, it implements a graph optimizer to process the structured data. At last, the optimized data is analyzed by Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to identify potential state derailment defects. We evaluated StateGuard through a dataset of 46 DEX projects containing 5,671 smart contracts, and it achieved 94.25% F1-score. In addition, in a comparison experiment with state-of-the-art, StateGuard leads the F1-score by 6.29%. To further verify its practicality, we used StateGuar to audit real-world contracts and successfully authenticated multiple novel CVEs.</p></details> | 13 pages |
| **[Challenges of Generating Structurally Diverse Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18859v2)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For many graph-related problems, it can be essential to have a set of structurally diverse graphs. For instance, such graphs can be used for testing graph algorithms or their neural approximations. However, to the best of our knowledge, the problem of generating structurally diverse graphs has not been explored in the literature. In this paper, we fill this gap. First, we discuss how to define diversity for a set of graphs, why this task is non-trivial, and how one can choose a proper diversity measure. Then, for a given diversity measure, we propose and compare several algorithms optimizing it: we consider approaches based on standard random graph models, local graph optimization, genetic algorithms, and neural generative models. We show that it is possible to significantly improve diversity over basic random graph generators. Additionally, our analysis of generated graphs allows us to better understand the properties of graph distances: depending on which diversity measure is used for optimization, the obtained graphs may possess very different structural properties which gives a better understanding of the graph distance underlying the diversity measure.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards a Converged Relational-Graph Optimization Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13480v3)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent ISO SQL:2023 standard adopts SQL/PGQ (Property Graph Queries), facilitating graph-like querying within relational databases. This advancement, however, underscores a significant gap in how to effectively optimize SQL/PGQ queries within relational database systems. To address this gap, we extend the foundational SPJ (Select-Project-Join) queries to SPJM queries, which include an additional matching operator for representing graph pattern matching in SQL/PGQ. Although SPJM queries can be converted to SPJ queries and optimized using existing relational query optimizers, our analysis shows that such a graph-agnostic method fails to benefit from graph-specific optimization techniques found in the literature. To address this issue, we develop a converged relational-graph optimization framework called RelGo for optimizing SPJM queries, leveraging joint efforts from both relational and graph query optimizations. Using DuckDB as the underlying relational execution engine, our experiments show that RelGo can generate efficient execution plans for SPJM queries. On well-established benchmarks, these plans exhibit an average speedup of 21.90x compared to those produced by the graph-agnostic optimizer.</p></details> |  |
| **[LiDAR-based Registration against Georeferenced Models for Globally Consistent Allocentric Maps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02533v1)** | 2024-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are irreplaceable in search and rescue (SAR) missions to obtain a situational overview or provide closeups without endangering personnel. However, UAVs heavily rely on global navigation satellite system (GNSS) for localization which works well in open spaces, but the precision drastically degrades in the vicinity of buildings. These inaccuracies hinder aggregation of diverse data from multiple sources in a unified georeferenced frame for SAR operators. In contrast, CityGML models provide approximate building shapes with accurate georeferenced poses. Besides, LiDAR works best in the vicinity of 3D structures. Hence, we refine coarse GNSS measurements by registering LiDAR maps against CityGML and digital elevation map (DEM) models as a prior for allocentric mapping. An intuitive plausibility score selects the best hypothesis based on occupancy using a 2D height map. Afterwards, we integrate the registration results in a continuous-time spline-based pose graph optimizer with LiDAR odometry and further sensing modalities to obtain globally consistent, georeferenced trajectories and maps. We evaluate the viability of our approach on multiple flights captured at two distinct testing sites. Our method successfully reduced GNSS offset errors from up-to 16 m to below 0.5 m on multiple flights. Furthermore, we obtain globally consistent maps w.r.t. prior 3D geospatial models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at IEEE International Symposium on Safety, Security, and Rescue Robotics (SSRR), New York City, USA, November 2024</p></details> |
| **[LiDAR SLAMMOT based on Confidence-guided Data Association](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01041v1)** | 2024-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the field of autonomous driving or robotics, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and multi-object tracking (MOT) are two fundamental problems and are generally applied separately. Solutions to SLAM and MOT usually rely on certain assumptions, such as the static environment assumption for SLAM and the accurate ego-vehicle pose assumption for MOT. But in complex dynamic environments, it is difficult or even impossible to meet these assumptions. Therefore, the SLAMMOT, i.e., simultaneous localization, mapping, and moving object tracking, integrated system of SLAM and object tracking, has emerged for autonomous vehicles in dynamic environments. However, many conventional SLAMMOT solutions directly perform data association on the predictions and detections for object tracking, but ignore their quality. In practice, inaccurate predictions caused by continuous multi-frame missed detections in temporary occlusion scenarios, may degrade the performance of tracking, thereby affecting SLAMMOT. To address this challenge, this paper presents a LiDAR SLAMMOT based on confidence-guided data association (Conf SLAMMOT) method, which tightly couples the LiDAR SLAM and the confidence-guided data association based multi-object tracking into a graph optimization backend for estimating the state of the ego-vehicle and objects simultaneously. The confidence of prediction and detection are applied in the factor graph-based multi-object tracking for its data association, which not only avoids the performance degradation caused by incorrect initial assignments in some filter-based methods but also handles issues such as continuous missed detection in tracking while also improving the overall performance of SLAMMOT. Various comparative experiments demonstrate the superior advantages of Conf SLAMMOT, especially in scenes with some missed detections.</p></details> |  |
| **[Utilizing Graph Generation for Enhanced Domain Adaptive Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06535v3)** | 2024-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The problem of Domain Adaptive in the field of Object Detection involves the transfer of object detection models from labeled source domains to unannotated target domains. Recent advancements in this field aim to address domain discrepancies by aligning pixel-pairs across domains within a non-Euclidean graphical space, thereby minimizing semantic distribution variance. Despite their remarkable achievements, these methods often use coarse semantic representations to model graphs, mainly due to ignoring non-informative elements and failing to focus on precise semantic alignment. Additionally, the generation of coarse graphs inherently introduces abnormal nodes, posing challenges and potentially biasing domain adaptation outcomes. Consequently, we propose a framework, which utilizes the Graph Generation to enhance the quality of DAOD (\method{}). Specifically, we introduce a Node Refinement module that utilizes a memory bank to reconstruct noisy sampled nodes while applying contrastive regularization to noisy features. To enhance semantic alignment, we propose separating domain-specific styles from category invariance encoded within graph covariances, which allows us to selectively remove domain-specific styles while preserving category-invariant information, thus facilitating more accurate semantic alignment across different domains. Furthermore, we propose a Graph Optimization adaptor, leveraging variational inference to mitigate the impact of abnormal nodes. Extensive experimentation across three adaptation benchmarks validates that \method{} achieves state-of-the-art performance in the task of unsupervised domain adaptation.</p></details> |  |

Integrity monitoring (IM) capability is required when FGO-based integrated navigation system is used for safety-critical applications. However, traditional researches on IM of integrated navigation system are mostly based on Kalman filter. It is urgent to develop effective IM scheme for FGO-based GNSS/INS/Vision integration. In this contribution, the position error bounding formula to ensure the integrity of the GNSS/INS/Vision integration based on FGO is designed and validated for the first time. It can be calculated by the linearized equations from the residuals of GNSS pseudo-range, IMU pre-integration and visual measurements. The specific position error bounding is given in the case of GNSS, INS and visual measurement faults. Field experiments were conducted to evaluate and validate the performance of the proposed position error bounding. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed position error bounding for the GNSS/INS/Vision integration based on FGO can correctly fit the position error against different fault modes, and the availability of integrity in six fault modes is 100% after correct and timely fault exclusion.</p></details> |  |

Compared to existing public datasets that primarily offer raw images, Open-Structure provides direct access to point and line measurements, correspondences, structural associations, and co-visibility factor graphs, which can be fed to various stages of SLAM pipelines to mitigate the impact of data preprocessing modules in ablation experiments. The dataset comprises two distinct types of sequences from the perspective of scenarios. The first type maintains reasonable observation and occlusion relationships, as these critical elements are extracted from public image-based sequences using our dataset generator. In contrast, the second type consists of carefully designed simulation sequences that enhance dataset diversity by introducing a wide range of trajectories and observations. Furthermore, a baseline is proposed using our dataset to evaluate widely used modules, including camera pose tracking, parametrization, and factor graph optimization, within SLAM systems. By evaluating these state-of-the-art algorithms across different scenarios, we discern each module's strengths and weaknesses in the context of camera tracking and optimization processes. The Open-Structure dataset and baseline system are openly accessible on website: \url{https://open-structure.github.io}, encouraging further research and development in the field of SLAM.</p></details> |  |

While global Structure-from-Motion (SfM) techniques are scalable and fast, they often compromise on accuracy. To address this, we introduce a principled approach that integrates gravity direction into the rotation averaging phase of global pipelines, enhancing camera orientation accuracy and reducing the degrees of freedom. This additional information is commonly available in recent consumer devices, such as smartphones, mixed-reality devices and drones, making the proposed method readily accessible. Rooted in circular regression, our algorithm has similar convergence guarantees as linear regression. It also supports scenarios where only a subset of cameras have known gravity. Additionally, we propose a mechanism to refine error-prone gravity. We achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on four large-scale datasets. Particularly, the proposed method improves upon the SfM baseline by 13 AUC@$1^\circ$ points, on average, while running eight times faster. It also outperforms the standard planar pose graph optimization technique by 23 AUC@$1^\circ$ points. The code is at https://github.com/colmap/glomap.</p></details> | accepted at ECCV2024 |

However, their use in data science scenarios requiring solving long-term interconnected tasks, dynamic data adjustments and domain expertise remains challenging. Previous approaches primarily focus on individual tasks, making it difficult to assess the complete data science workflow. Moreover, they struggle to handle real-time changes in intermediate data and fail to adapt dynamically to evolving task dependencies inherent to data science problems. In this paper, we present Data Interpreter, an LLM-based agent designed to automatically solve various data science problems end-to-end. Our Data Interpreter incorporates two key modules: 1) Hierarchical Graph Modeling, which breaks down complex problems into manageable subproblems, enabling dynamic node generation and graph optimization; and 2) Programmable Node Generation, a technique that refines and verifies each subproblem to iteratively improve code generation results and robustness. Extensive experiments consistently demonstrate the superiority of Data Interpreter. On InfiAgent-DABench, it achieves a 25% performance boost, raising accuracy from 75.9% to 94.9%. For machine learning and open-ended tasks, it improves performance from 88% to 95%, and from 60% to 97%, respectively. Moreover, on the MATH dataset, Data Interpreter achieves remarkable performance with a 26% improvement compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

| **[Interdependency Matters: Graph Alignment for Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08877v1)** | 2024-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection in multivariate time series (MTS) is crucial for various applications in data mining and industry. Current industrial methods typically approach anomaly detection as an unsupervised learning task, aiming to identify deviations by estimating the normal distribution in noisy, label-free datasets. These methods increasingly incorporate interdependencies between channels through graph structures to enhance accuracy. However, the role of interdependencies is more critical than previously understood, as shifts in interdependencies between MTS channels from normal to anomalous data are significant. This observation suggests that \textit{anomalies could be detected by changes in these interdependency graph series}. To capitalize on this insight, we introduce MADGA (MTS Anomaly Detection via Graph Alignment), which redefines anomaly detection as a graph alignment (GA) problem that explicitly utilizes interdependencies for anomaly detection. MADGA dynamically transforms subsequences into graphs to capture the evolving interdependencies, and Graph alignment is performed between these graphs, optimizing an alignment plan that minimizes cost, effectively minimizing the distance for normal data and maximizing it for anomalous data. Uniquely, our GA approach involves explicit alignment of both nodes and edges, employing Wasserstein distance for nodes and Gromov-Wasserstein distance for edges. To our knowledge, this is the first application of GA to MTS anomaly detection that explicitly leverages interdependency for this purpose. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of MADGA, demonstrating its capability to detect anomalies and differentiate interdependencies, consistently achieving state-of-the-art across various scenarios.</p></details> |  |

As near capacity-approaching codes, Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes possess several advantages over other families of codes, the most notable being its efficient decoding via Belief Propagation. While many LDPC code design methods exist, the development of efficient sparse codes that meet the constraints of modern short code lengths and accommodate new channel models remains a challenge. In this work, we propose for the first time a gradient-based data-driven approach for the design of sparse codes. We develop locally optimal codes with respect to Belief Propagation decoding via the learning of the Factor graph under channel noise simulations. This is performed via a novel complete graph tensor representation of the Belief Propagation algorithm, optimized over finite fields via backpropagation and coupled with an efficient line-search method. The proposed approach is shown to outperform the decoding performance of existing popular codes by orders of magnitude and demonstrates the power of data-driven approaches for code design.</p></details> |  |

However, this task is often hindered by the limited availability of densely annotated surgical scene data. In this work, we introduce an end-to-end framework for the generation and optimization of surgical scene graphs on a downstream task. Our approach leverages the flexibility of graph-based spectral clustering and the generalization capability of foundation models to generate unsupervised scene graphs with learnable properties. We reinforce the initial spatial graph with sparse temporal connections using local matches between consecutive frames to predict temporally consistent clusters across a temporal neighborhood. By jointly optimizing the spatiotemporal relations and node features of the dynamic scene graph with the downstream task of phase segmentation, we address the costly and annotation-burdensome task of semantic scene comprehension and scene graph generation in surgical videos using only weak surgical phase labels. Further, by incorporating effective intermediate scene representation disentanglement steps within the pipeline, our solution outperforms the SOTA on the CATARACTS dataset by 8% accuracy and 10% F1 score in surgical workflow recognition</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables, MICCAI GRAIL Workshop paper</p></details> |
| **[Robust Gaussian Splatting SLAM by Leveraging Loop Closure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20111v1)** | 2024-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting algorithms excel in novel view rendering applications and have been adapted to extend the capabilities of traditional SLAM systems. However, current Gaussian Splatting SLAM methods, designed mainly for hand-held RGB or RGB-D sensors, struggle with tracking drifts when used with rotating RGB-D camera setups. In this paper, we propose a robust Gaussian Splatting SLAM architecture that utilizes inputs from rotating multiple RGB-D cameras to achieve accurate localization and photorealistic rendering performance. The carefully designed Gaussian Splatting Loop Closure module effectively addresses the issue of accumulated tracking and mapping errors found in conventional Gaussian Splatting SLAM systems. First, each Gaussian is associated with an anchor frame and categorized as historical or novel based on its timestamp. By rendering different types of Gaussians at the same viewpoint, the proposed loop detection strategy considers both co-visibility relationships and distinct rendering outcomes. Furthermore, a loop closure optimization approach is proposed to remove camera pose drift and maintain the high quality of 3D Gaussian models. The approach uses a lightweight pose graph optimization algorithm to correct pose drift and updates Gaussians based on the optimized poses. Additionally, a bundle adjustment scheme further refines camera poses using photometric and geometric constraints, ultimately enhancing the global consistency of scenarios. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in camera pose estimation and novel view rendering tasks. The code will be open-sourced for the community.</p></details> |  |

Efficient, accurate self and mutual state estimation are the critical preconditions for completing these swarm tasks, which remain challenging research topics. This paper proposes Swarm-LIO2: a fully decentralized, plug-and-play, computationally efficient, and bandwidth-efficient LiDAR-inertial odometry for aerial swarm systems. Swarm-LIO2 uses a decentralized, plug-and-play network as the communication infrastructure. Only bandwidth-efficient and low-dimensional information is exchanged, including identity, ego-state, mutual observation measurements, and global extrinsic transformations. To support the plug-and-play of new teammate participants, Swarm-LIO2 detects potential teammate UAVs and initializes the temporal offset and global extrinsic transformation all automatically. To enhance the initialization efficiency, novel reflectivity-based UAV detection, trajectory matching, and factor graph optimization methods are proposed. For state estimation, Swarm-LIO2 fuses LiDAR, IMU, and mutual observation measurements within an efficient ESIKF framework, with careful compensation of temporal delay and modeling of measurements to enhance the accuracy and consistency.</p></details> | 23 Pages |

To this end, we introduce Walker, the first self-supervised tracker that learns from videos with sparse bounding box annotations, and no tracking labels. First, we design a quasi-dense temporal object appearance graph, and propose a novel multi-positive contrastive objective to optimize random walks on the graph and learn instance similarities. Then, we introduce an algorithm to enforce mutually-exclusive connective properties across instances in the graph, optimizing the learned topology for MOT. At inference time, we propose to associate detected instances to tracklets based on the max-likelihood transition state under motion-constrained bi-directional walks. Walker is the first self-supervised tracker to achieve competitive performance on MOT17, DanceTrack, and BDD100K. Remarkably, our proposal outperforms the previous self-supervised trackers even when drastically reducing the annotation requirements by up to 400x.</p></details> | ECCV 2024 |

However, learning the underlying probability distribution can be very challenging and intractable. To this end, we introduce an approach which employs the characteristic function (CF), a probabilistic descriptor that directly corresponds to the distribution. However, unlike the probability density function (pdf), the characteristic function not only always exists, but also provides an additional degree of freedom, hence enhances flexibility in learning distributions. This removes the critical dependence on pdf-based assumptions, which limit the applicability of traditional methods. While several works have attempted to use CF in generative modeling, they often impose strong constraints on the training process. In contrast, our approach calculates the distance between query points in the CF domain, which is an unconstrained and well defined problem. Next, to deal with the sampling strategy, which is crucial to model performance, we propose a graph neural network (GNN)-based optimizer for the sampling process, which identifies regions where the difference between CFs is most significant. In addition, our method allows the use of a pre-trained model, such as a well-trained autoencoder, and is capable of learning directly in its feature space, without modifying its parameters. This offers a flexible and robust approach to generative modeling, not only provides broader applicability and improved performance, but also equips any latent space world with the ability to become a generative model.</p></details> |  |

Integrating diverse and complementary sensors such as global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and 4D-radar can provide scalable and reliable global localization. Nevertheless, multi-sensor fusion encounters challenges including heterogeneity and time-varying uncertainty in measurements. Consequently, developing a reliable and unified multi-sensor framework remains challenging. In this paper, we introduce UniMSF, a comprehensive multi-sensor fusion localization framework for ITS, utilizing factor graphs. By integrating a multi-sensor fusion front-end, alongside outlier detection\&noise model estimation, and a factor graph optimization back-end, this framework accomplishes efficient fusion and ensures accurate localization for ITS. Specifically, in the multi-sensor fusion front-end module, we tackle the measurement heterogeneity among different modality sensors and establish effective measurement models. Reliable outlier detection and data-driven online noise estimation methods ensure that back-end optimization is immune to interference from outlier measurements. In addition, integrating multi-sensor observations via factor graph optimization offers the advantage of \enquote{plug and play}. Notably, our framework features high modularity and is seamlessly adapted to various sensor configurations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework through real vehicle tests by tightly integrating GNSS pseudorange and carrier phase information with IMU, and 4D-radar.</p></details> |  |

However, the pose-only solution has not yet been properly considered in a tightly-coupled visual-inertial state estimator (VISE) with a normal configuration for real-time navigation. In this study, we propose a tightly-coupled LiDAR-enhanced VISE, named PO-VINS, with a full pose-only form for visual and LiDAR-depth measurements. Based on the pose-only visual representation, we derive the analytical depth uncertainty, which is then employed for rejecting LiDAR depth outliers. Besides, we propose a multi-state constraint (MSC)-based LiDAR-depth measurement model with a pose-only form, to balance efficiency and robustness. The pose-only visual and LiDAR-depth measurements and the IMU-preintegration measurements are tightly integrated under the factor graph optimization framework to perform efficient and accurate state estimation. Exhaustive experimental results on private and public datasets indicate that the proposed PO-VINS yields improved or comparable accuracy to sate-of-the-art methods. Compared to the baseline method LE-VINS, the state-estimation efficiency of PO-VINS is improved by 33% and 56% on the laptop PC and the onboard ARM computer, respectively. Besides, PO-VINS yields higher accuracy and robustness than LE-VINS by employing the proposed uncertainty-based outlier-culling method and the MSC-based measurement model for LiDAR depth.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 13 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

However, the ethnic disparity in these models' predictions needs to be addressed before deploying them. We introduce a novel approach, PatchAlign, to enhance skin condition image classification accuracy and fairness by aligning with clinical text representations of skin conditions. PatchAlign uses Graph Optimal Transport (GOT) Loss as a regularizer to perform cross-domain alignment. The representations obtained are robust and generalize well across skin tones, even with limited training samples. To reduce the effect of noise and artifacts in clinical dermatology images, we propose a learnable Masked Graph Optimal Transport for cross-domain alignment that further improves fairness metrics. We compare our model to the state-of-the-art FairDisCo on two skin lesion datasets with different skin types: Fitzpatrick17k and Diverse Dermatology Images (DDI). PatchAlign enhances the accuracy of skin condition image classification by 2.8% (in-domain) and 6.2% (out-domain) on Fitzpatrick17k, and 4.2% (in-domain) on DDI compared to FairDisCo. Additionally, it consistently improves the fairness of true positive rates across skin tones. The source code for the implementation is available at the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/aayushmanace/PatchAlign24, enabling easy reproduction and further experimentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>MICCA...</summary><p>MICCAI 2024.

| **[SurgTrack: CAD-Free 3D Tracking of Real-world Surgical Instruments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02598v1)** | 2024-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-based surgical navigation has received increasing attention due to its non-invasive, cost-effective, and flexible advantages. In particular, a critical element of the vision-based navigation system is tracking surgical instruments. Compared with 2D instrument tracking methods, 3D instrument tracking has broader value in clinical practice, but is also more challenging due to weak texture, occlusion, and lack of Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models for 3D registration. To solve these challenges, we propose the SurgTrack, a two-stage 3D instrument tracking method for CAD-free and robust real-world applications. In the first registration stage, we incorporate an Instrument Signed Distance Field (SDF) modeling the 3D representation of instruments, achieving CAD-freed 3D registration. Due to this, we can obtain the location and orientation of instruments in the 3D space by matching the video stream with the registered SDF model. In the second tracking stage, we devise a posture graph optimization module, leveraging the historical tracking results of the posture memory pool to optimize the tracking results and improve the occlusion robustness. Furthermore, we collect the Instrument3D dataset to comprehensively evaluate the 3D tracking of surgical instruments. The extensive experiments validate the superiority and scalability of our SurgTrack, by outperforming the state-of-the-arts with a remarkable improvement.

Graphs can be recursively combined into larger composite graphs representing hierarchies of inter-agent collaboration (where edges connect operations of different agents). Our novel automatic graph optimizers (1) refine node-level LLM prompts (node optimization) and (2) improve agent orchestration by changing graph connectivity (edge optimization).

However, existing 3DGS-based methods fail to address the global consistency of the scene via loop closure and/or global bundle adjustment. To this end, we propose LoopSplat, which takes RGB-D images as input and performs dense mapping with 3DGS submaps and frame-to-model tracking. LoopSplat triggers loop closure online and computes relative loop edge constraints between submaps directly via 3DGS registration, leading to improvements in efficiency and accuracy over traditional global-to-local point cloud registration. It uses a robust pose graph optimization formulation and rigidly aligns the submaps to achieve global consistency. Evaluation on the synthetic Replica and real-world TUM-RGBD, ScanNet, and ScanNet++ datasets demonstrates competitive or superior tracking, mapping, and rendering compared to existing methods for dense RGB-D SLAM.

This paper proposes a Tracklet Graph and Query Graph-based framework, i.e., GSLAMOT, to address this challenge. GSLAMOT utilizes camera and LiDAR multimodal information as inputs and divides the representation of the dynamic scene into a semantic map for representing the static environment, a trajectory of the ego-agent, and an online maintained Tracklet Graph (TG) for tracking and predicting the 3D poses of the detected mobile objects. A Query Graph (QG) is constructed in each frame by object detection to query and update TG. For accurate object association, a Multi-criteria Star Graph Association (MSGA) method is proposed to find matched objects between the detections in QG and the predicted tracklets in TG. Then, an Object-centric Graph Optimization (OGO) method is proposed to simultaneously optimize the TG, the semantic map, and the agent trajectory. It triangulates the detected objects into the map to enrich the map's semantic information. We address the efficiency issues to handle the three tightly coupled tasks in parallel. Experiments are conducted on KITTI, Waymo, and an emulated Traffic Congestion dataset that highlights challenging scenarios. Experiments show that GSLAMOT enables accurate crowded object tracking while conducting SLAM accurately in challenging scenarios, demonstrating more excellent performances than the state-of-the-art methods.

The optimization procedure can be negatively affected even by a single outlier measurement, with possible catastrophic and meaningless results. Although recent works on robust optimization aim to mitigate the presence of outlier measurements, robust solutions capable of handling large numbers of outliers are yet to come. This paper presents IPC, acronym for Incremental Probabilistic Consensus, a method that approximates the solution to the combinatorial problem of finding the maximally consistent set of measurements in an incremental fashion. It evaluates the consistency of each loop closure measurement through a consensus-based procedure, possibly applied to a subset of the global problem, where all previously integrated inlier measurements have veto power. We evaluated IPC on standard benchmarks against several state-of-the-art methods. Although it is simple and relatively easy to implement, IPC competes with or outperforms the other tested methods in handling outliers while providing online performances. We release with this paper an open-source implementation of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication at the 2024 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)</p></details> |

In this paper, we represent the rotation and translation by a unit quaternion and a three-dimensional vector, and propose a new PGO model based on the von Mises-Fisher distribution. The constraints derived from the unit quaternions are spherical manifolds, and the projection onto the constraints can be calculated by normalization. Then a proximal linearized Riemannian alternating direction method of multipliers (PieADMM) is developed to solve the proposed model, which not only has low memory requirements, but also can update the poses in parallel. Furthermore, we establish the iteration complexity of $O(1/\epsilon^{2})$ of PieADMM for finding an $\epsilon$-stationary solution of our model. The efficiency of our proposed algorithm is demonstrated by numerical experiments on two synthetic and four 3D SLAM benchmark datasets.</p></details> |  |

The state-of-the-art approaches usually employ a tracking-by-detection method, and data association plays a critical role. This paper proposes a learning and graph-optimized (LEGO) modular tracker to improve data association performance in the existing literature. The proposed LEGO tracker integrates graph optimization and self-attention mechanisms, which efficiently formulate the association score map, facilitating the accurate and efficient matching of objects across time frames. To further enhance the state update process, the Kalman filter is added to ensure consistent tracking by incorporating temporal coherence in the object states. Our proposed method utilizing LiDAR alone has shown exceptional performance compared to other online tracking approaches, including LiDAR-based and LiDAR-camera fusion-based methods.

However, it has not yet been properly considered and studied for LiDAR-based odometry. In this paper, we propose a novel tightly coupled LiDAR-inertial odometry based on the MSCKF framework, named MSC-LIO. An efficient LiDAR same-plane-point (LSPP) tracking method, without explicit feature extraction, is present for frame-to-frame data associations. The tracked LSPPs are employed to build an LSPP measurement model, which constructs a multi-state constraint. Besides, we propose an effective point-velocity-based LiDAR-IMU time-delay (LITD) estimation method, which is derived from the proposed LSPP tracking method. Extensive experiments were conducted on both public and private datasets. The results demonstrate that the proposed MSC-LIO yields higher accuracy and efficiency than the state-of-the-art methods. The ablation experiment results indicate that the data-association efficiency is improved by nearly 3 times using the LSPP tracking method.

However, existing approaches often struggle with data redundancy, robustness, and accuracy in complex environments. To address these challenges, we present MS-Mapping, an novel multi-session LiDAR mapping system that employs an incremental mapping scheme for robust and accurate map assembly in large-scale environments. Our approach introduces three key innovations: 1) A distribution-aware keyframe selection method that captures the subtle contributions of each point cloud frame to the map by analyzing the similarity of map distributions. This method effectively reduces data redundancy and pose graph size, while enhancing graph optimization speed; 2) An uncertainty model that automatically performs least-squares adjustments according to the covariance matrix during graph optimization, improving mapping precision, robustness, and flexibility without the need for scene-specific parameter tuning. This uncertainty model enables our system to monitor pose uncertainty and avoid ill-posed optimizations, thereby increasing adaptability to diverse and challenging environments. 3) To ensure fair evaluation, we redesign baseline comparisons and the evaluation benchmark. Direct assessment of map accuracy demonstrates the superiority of the proposed MS-Mapping algorithm compared to state-of-the-art methods. In addition to employing public datasets such as Urban-Nav, FusionPortable, and Newer College, we conducted extensive experiments on such a large \SI{855}{m}$\times$\SI{636}{m} ground truth map, collecting over \SI{20}{km} of indoor and outdoor data across more than ten sequences...</p></details> | 18 pages, 22 figures |

Sensors are often corrupted in those complicated and large-scale environments. This paper introduces GNSS-FGO, an online and global trajectory estimator that fuses GNSS observations alongside multiple sensor measurements for robust vehicle localization. In GNSS-FGO, we fuse asynchronous sensor measurements into the graph with a continuous-time trajectory representation using Gaussian process regression. This enables querying states at arbitrary timestamps so that sensor observations are fused without requiring strict state and measurement synchronization. Thus, the proposed method presents a generalized factor graph for multi-sensor fusion. To evaluate and study different GNSS fusion strategies, we fuse GNSS measurements in loose and tight coupling with a speed sensor, IMU, and lidar-odometry. We employed datasets from measurement campaigns in Aachen, Duesseldorf, and Cologne in experimental studies and presented comprehensive discussions on sensor observations, smoother types, and hyperparameter tuning. Our results show that the proposed approach enables robust trajectory estimation in dense urban areas, where the classic multi-sensor fusion method fails due to sensor degradation. In a test sequence containing a 17km route through Aachen, the proposed method results in a mean 2D positioning error of 0.48m while fusing raw GNSS observations with lidar odometry in a tight coupling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the IEEE Transactions on Robotics</p></details> |
| **[RoCo:Robust Collaborative Perception By Iterative Object Matching and Pose Adjustment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00257v1)** | 2024-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collaborative autonomous driving with multiple vehicles usually requires the data fusion from multiple modalities. To ensure effective fusion, the data from each individual modality shall maintain a reasonably high quality. However, in collaborative perception, the quality of object detection based on a modality is highly sensitive to the relative pose errors among the agents. It leads to feature misalignment and significantly reduces collaborative performance. To address this issue, we propose RoCo, a novel unsupervised framework to conduct iterative object matching and agent pose adjustment. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to model the pose correction problem in collaborative perception as an object matching task, which reliably associates common objects detected by different agents. On top of this, we propose a graph optimization process to adjust the agent poses by minimizing the alignment errors of the associated objects, and the object matching is re-done based on the adjusted agent poses. This process is carried out iteratively until convergence. Experimental study on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrates that the proposed framework RoCo consistently outperforms existing relevant methods in terms of the collaborative object detection performance, and exhibits highly desired robustness when the pose information of agents is with high-level noise. Ablation studies are also provided to show the impact of its key parameters and components. The code is released at https://github.com/HuangZhe885/RoCo.</p></details> | ACM MM2024 |

However, commonly available prior maps are still tailored to control-and-decision tasks, and the use of these maps for localization remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose a lidar-based localization and mapping (LOAM) system that can exploit the common HD-maps in autonomous driving scenarios. Specifically, we propose a technique to extract information from the drivable area and ground surface height components of the HD-maps to construct 4DOF pose priors. These pose priors are then further integrated into the pose-graph optimization problem to create a globally consistent 3D map. Experiments show that our scheme can significantly improve the global consistency of the map compared to state-of-the-art lidar-only approaches, proven to be a useful technology to enhance the system's robustness, especially in GPS-denied environment. Moreover, our work also serves as a first step towards long-term navigation of robots in familiar environment, by updating a map. In autonomous driving this could enable updating the HD-maps without sourcing a new from a third party company, which is expensive and introduces delays from change in the world to updated map.</p></details> |  |

To improve detection performance, counterfactual graphs have been exploited to benefit the generalization capacity by learning causal relations. Most existing studies directly introduce perturbations (e.g., flipping edges) to generate counterfactual graphs, which are prone to alter the semantics of generated examples and make them off the data manifold, resulting in sub-optimal performance. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach, Motif-consistent Counterfactuals with Adversarial Refinement (MotifCAR), for graph-level anomaly detection. The model combines the motif of one graph, the core subgraph containing the identification (category) information, and the contextual subgraph (non-motif) of another graph to produce a raw counterfactual graph. However, the produced raw graph might be distorted and cannot satisfy the important counterfactual properties: Realism, Validity, Proximity and Sparsity. Towards that, we present a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based graph optimizer to refine the raw counterfactual graphs. It adopts the discriminator to guide the generator to generate graphs close to realistic data, i.e., meet the property Realism. Further, we design the motif consistency to force the motif of the generated graphs to be consistent with the realistic graphs, meeting the property Validity. Also, we devise the contextual loss and connection loss to control the contextual subgraph and the newly added links to meet the properties Proximity and Sparsity. As a result, the model can generate high-quality counterfactual graphs. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of MotifCAR.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD 2024 |

Recently, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have emerged as a promising framework for 3D modeling. However, NeRFs require accurate camera poses as input, and existing methods struggle to handle significantly noisy pose estimates (i.e., outliers), which are commonly encountered in real-world scenarios. To tackle this challenge, we present a novel approach that optimizes radiance fields with scene graphs to mitigate the influence of outlier poses. Our method incorporates an adaptive inlier-outlier confidence estimation scheme based on scene graphs, emphasizing images of high compatibility with the neighborhood and consistency in the rendering quality. We also introduce an effective intersection-over-union (IoU) loss to optimize the camera pose and surface geometry, together with a coarse-to-fine strategy to facilitate the training. Furthermore, we propose a new dataset containing typical outlier poses for a detailed evaluation. Experimental results on various datasets consistently demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method over existing approaches, showcasing its robustness in handling outliers and producing high-quality 3D reconstructions.

Due to some deficits of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), such as susceptible to interferences, integrating of GNSS with additional alternative sensors is a promising approach to overcome the performance limitations of GNSS-based localization systems. Ultra-Wideband (UWB) can be used to enhance GNSS in constructing an integrated localization system. However, most low-cost UWB devices lack a hardware-level time synchronization feature, which necessitates the estimation and compensation of the time-offset in the tightly coupled GNSS/UWB integration. Given the flexibility of probabilistic graphical models, the time-offset can be modeled as an invariant constant in the discretization of the continuous model. This work proposes a novel architecture in which Factor Graph Optimization (FGO) is hybrid with Extend Kalman Filter (EKF) for tightly coupled GNSS/UWB integration with online Temporal calibration (FE-GUT). FGO is utilized to precisely estimate the time-offset, while EKF provides initailization for the new factors and performs time-offset compensation. Simulation-based experiments validate the integrated localization performance of FE-GUT. In a four-wheeled robot scenario, the results demonstrate that, compared to EKF, FE-GUT can improve horizontal and vertical localization accuracy by 58.59\% and 34.80\%, respectively, while the time-offset estimation accuracy is improved by 76.80\%.

The proposed approach is based on a Voxel-TSDF representation used in recent algorithms. It introduces novel ways of integrating semantic prediction confidence during mapping, producing semantic and instance-consistent 3D regions. Further improvements are achieved by graph optimization-based semantic labeling and instance refinement. The proposed method achieves accuracy superior to the state of the art on public large-scale datasets, improving on a number of widely used metrics. We also highlight a downfall in the evaluation of recent studies: using the ground truth trajectory as input instead of a SLAM-estimated one substantially affects the accuracy, creating a large gap between the reported results and the actual performance on real-world data.</p></details> | 8 pages, 2 figures |

Graphon theory provides an approach to overcome these issues by defining limit objects for infinite sequences of graphs permitting one to approximate arbitrarily large networks by infinite dimensional operators. This is extended to stochastic systems by the use of Q-noise, a generalization of Wiener processes in finite dimensional spaces to processes in function spaces. The optimal control of linear quadratic problems on graphon systems with Q-noise disturbances are defined and shown to be the limit of the corresponding finite graph optimal control problem. The theory is extended to low rank systems, and a fully worked special case is presented. In addition, the worst-case long-range average and infinite horizon discounted optimal control performance with respect to Q-noise distribution are computed for a small set of standard graphon limits.</p></details> | 18 pages, 6 figures |

Such robots require SLAM algorithms suitable for specific applications and environments. Hence, several SLAM frameworks have been proposed to address various requirements in the past decade. However, we have encountered challenges in implementing recent innovative frameworks when handling service robots with low-end processors and insufficient sensor data, such as low-resolution 2D LiDAR sensors. Specifically, regarding commercial robots, consistent performance in different hardware configurations and environments is more crucial than the performance dedicated to specific sensors or environments. Therefore, we propose a) a multi-stage %hierarchical approach for global pose estimation in embedded systems; b) a graph generation method with zero constraints for synchronized sensors; and c) a robust and memory-efficient method for long-term pose-graph optimization. As verified in in-home and large-scale indoor environments, the proposed method yields consistent global pose estimation for services in commercial fields. Furthermore, the proposed method exhibits potential commercial viability considering the consistent performance verified via mass production and long-term (> 5 years) operation.</p></details> |  |

While open resources like OpenStreetMap (OSM) offer road networks with well-defined topology, they may not always be up to date worldwide. In this paper, we propose a fully automated pipeline for extracting road networks from very-high-resolution (VHR) satellite imagery. Our approach directly generates road line-strings that are seamlessly connected and precisely positioned. The process involves three key modules: a CNN-based neural network for road segmentation, a graph optimization algorithm to convert road predictions into vector line-strings, and a machine learning model for classifying road materials. Compared to OSM data, our results demonstrate significant potential for providing the latest road layouts and precise positions of road segments.</p></details> |  |

In particular, graph matching is a classical problem in pattern analysis with enormous applications. Many graph problems have been formulated as a mathematical program and then solved using exact, heuristic, and/or approximated-guaranteed procedures. On the other hand, graph theory has been a powerful tool in visualizing and understanding complex mathematical programming problems, especially integer programs. Formulating a graph problem as a natural integer program (IP) is often a challenging task. However, an IP formulation of the problem has many advantages. Several researchers have noted the need for natural IP formulation of graph theoretic problems. The present study aims to provide a unified framework for IP formulation of graph-matching problems. Although there are many surveys on graph matching problems, none is concerned with IP formulation. This paper is the first to provide a comprehensive IP formulation for such problems. The framework includes a variety of graph optimization problems in the literature. While these problems have been studied by different research communities, however, the framework presented here helps to bring efforts from different disciplines to tackle such diverse and complex problems. We hope the present study can significantly help to simplify some of the difficult problems arising in practice, especially in pattern analysis.</p></details> | 34 pages |

We introduce various types of errors commonly encountered in SLAM, including reprojection error, photometric error, relative pose error, and line reprojection error, alongside their mathematical formulations. The fundamental role of error as the discrepancy between observed and predicted values in SLAM optimization is examined, emphasizing non-linear least squares methods for optimization. We provide a detailed analysis of: - Reprojection Error: Including Jacobian calculations for camera poses and map points, highlighting both theoretical underpinnings and practical consequences. - Photometric Error: Addressing errors from image intensity variations, essential for direct method-based SLAM. - Relative Pose Error: Discussing its significance in pose graph optimization, especially in loop closure scenarios. The paper also presents extensive derivations of Jacobian matrices for various SLAM components such as camera poses, map points, and motion parameters. We explore the application of Lie theory to optimize rotation representations and transformations, improving computational efficiency. Specific software implementations are referenced, offering practical insights into the real-world application of these theories in SLAM systems. Additionally, advanced topics such as line reprojection errors and IMU measurement errors are explored, discussing their impact on SLAM accuracy and performance. This comprehensive examination aims to enhance understanding and implementation of error analysis and Jacobian derivation in SLAM, contributing to more accurate and efficient state estimation in complex environments.</p></details> |  |

In response, we introduce Loopy-SLAM that globally optimizes poses and the dense 3D model. We use frame-to-model tracking using a data-driven point-based submap generation method and trigger loop closures online by performing global place recognition. Robust pose graph optimization is used to rigidly align the local submaps. As our representation is point based, map corrections can be performed efficiently without the need to store the entire history of input frames used for mapping as typically required by methods employing a grid based mapping structure. Evaluation on the synthetic Replica and real-world TUM-RGBD and ScanNet datasets demonstrate competitive or superior performance in tracking, mapping, and rendering accuracy when compared to existing dense neural RGBD SLAM methods.

| **[Fusing Structure from Motion and Simulation-Augmented Pose Regression from Optical Flow for Challenging Indoor Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07250v4)** | 2024-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The localization of objects is a crucial task in various applications such as robotics, virtual and augmented reality, and the transportation of goods in warehouses. Recent advances in deep learning have enabled the localization using monocular visual cameras. While structure from motion (SfM) predicts the absolute pose from a point cloud, absolute pose regression (APR) methods learn a semantic understanding of the environment through neural networks. However, both fields face challenges caused by the environment such as motion blur, lighting changes, repetitive patterns, and feature-less structures. This study aims to address these challenges by incorporating additional information and regularizing the absolute pose using relative pose regression (RPR) methods. RPR methods suffer under different challenges, i.e., motion blur. The optical flow between consecutive images is computed using the Lucas-Kanade algorithm, and the relative pose is predicted using an auxiliary small recurrent convolutional network. The fusion of absolute and relative poses is a complex task due to the mismatch between the global and local coordinate systems. State-of-the-art methods fusing absolute and relative poses use pose graph optimization (PGO) to regularize the absolute pose predictions using relative poses. In this work, we propose recurrent fusion networks to optimally align absolute and relative pose predictions to improve the absolute pose prediction. We evaluate eight different recurrent units and construct a simulation environment to pre-train the APR and RPR networks for better generalized training. Additionally, we record a large database of different scenarios in a challenging large-scale indoor environment that mimics a warehouse with transportation robots. We conduct hyperparameter searches and experiments to show the effectiveness of our recurrent fusion method compared to PGO.</p></details> |  |

Optimal graph filters rely on Laplacian eigendecomposition for Fourier transform. In an attempt to avert prohibitive computations, numerous polynomial filters have been proposed. However, polynomials in the majority of these filters are predefined and remain fixed across different graphs, failing to accommodate the varying degrees of heterophily. Addressing this gap, we demystify the intrinsic correlation between the spectral property of desired polynomial bases and the heterophily degrees via thorough theoretical analyses. Subsequently, we develop a novel adaptive heterophily basis wherein the basis vectors mutually form angles reflecting the heterophily degree of the graph. We integrate this heterophily basis with the homophily basis to construct a universal polynomial basis UniBasis, which devises a polynomial filter based graph neural network - UniFilter. It optimizes the convolution and propagation in GNN, thus effectively limiting over-smoothing and alleviating over-squashing. Our extensive experiments, conducted on a diverse range of real-world and synthetic datasets with varying degrees of heterophily, support the superiority of UniFilter. These results not only demonstrate the universality of UniBasis but also highlight its proficiency in graph explanation.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2311.18177</p></details> |

Prior kinematic motion model-based IO methods often use a simplified linearized IMU noise model and thus usually encounter difficulties in modeling non-deterministic errors arising from environmental disturbances and mechanical defects. In contrast, data-driven IO methods struggle to accurately model the sensor motions, often leading to generalizability and interoperability issues. To address these challenges, we present AirIMU, a hybrid approach to estimate the uncertainty, especially the non-deterministic errors, by data-driven methods and increase the generalization abilities using model-based methods. We demonstrate the adaptability of AirIMU using a full spectrum of IMUs, from low-cost automotive grades to high-end navigation grades. We also validate its effectiveness on various platforms, including hand-held devices, vehicles, and a helicopter that covers a trajectory of 262 kilometers. In the ablation study, we validate the effectiveness of our learned uncertainty in an IMU-GPS pose graph optimization experiment, achieving a 31.6\% improvement in accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that jointly training the IMU noise correction and uncertainty estimation synergistically benefits both tasks.</p></details> |  |

Solutions such as pre-training and domain-specific fine-tuning add substantial computational overhead, requiring further domain expertise. Here, we introduce a token-optimized and robust Knowledge Graph-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (KG-RAG) framework by leveraging a massive biomedical KG (SPOKE) with LLMs such as Llama-2-13b, GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4, to generate meaningful biomedical text rooted in established knowledge. Compared to the existing RAG technique for Knowledge Graphs, the proposed method utilizes minimal graph schema for context extraction and uses embedding methods for context pruning. This optimization in context extraction results in more than 50% reduction in token consumption without compromising the accuracy, making a cost-effective and robust RAG implementation on proprietary LLMs. KG-RAG consistently enhanced the performance of LLMs across diverse biomedical prompts by generating responses rooted in established knowledge, accompanied by accurate provenance and statistical evidence (if available) to substantiate the claims. Further benchmarking on human curated datasets, such as biomedical true/false and multiple-choice questions (MCQ), showed a remarkable 71% boost in the performance of the Llama-2 model on the challenging MCQ dataset, demonstrating the framework's capacity to empower open-source models with fewer parameters for domain specific questions. Furthermore, KG-RAG enhanced the performance of proprietary GPT models, such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. In summary, the proposed framework combines explicit and implicit knowledge of KG and LLM in a token optimized fashion, thus enhancing the adaptability of general-purpose LLMs to tackle domain-specific questions in a cost-effective fashion.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 5 figures, 1 table, 1 supplementary file</p></details> |

Previous studies have demonstrated that, while incorporating guidance, such as highways, can accelerate MAPF algorithms, this often results in a trade-off with solution quality. In addition, how to generate good guidance automatically remains largely unexplored, with current methods falling short of surpassing manually designed ones. In this work, we introduce the guidance graph as a versatile representation of guidance for lifelong MAPF, framing Guidance Graph Optimization as the task of optimizing its edge weights. We present two GGO algorithms to automatically generate guidance for arbitrary lifelong MAPF algorithms and maps. The first method directly optimizes edge weights, while the second method optimizes an update model capable of generating edge weights. Empirically, we show that (1) our guidance graphs improve the throughput of three representative lifelong MAPF algorithms in eight benchmark maps, and (2) our update model can generate guidance graphs for as large as $93 \times 91$ maps and as many as 3,000 agents.

However, most existing HGNNs rely on spatial domain-based methods to aggregate information, i.e., manually selected meta-paths or some heuristic modules, lacking theoretical guarantees. Furthermore, these methods cannot learn arbitrary valid heterogeneous graph filters within the spectral domain, which have limited expressiveness. To tackle these issues, we present a positive spectral heterogeneous graph convolution via positive noncommutative polynomials. Then, using this convolution, we propose PSHGCN, a novel Positive Spectral Heterogeneous Graph Convolutional Network. PSHGCN offers a simple yet effective method for learning valid heterogeneous graph filters. Moreover, we demonstrate the rationale of PSHGCN in the graph optimization framework. We conducted an extensive experimental study to show that PSHGCN can learn diverse heterogeneous graph filters and outperform all baselines on open benchmarks. Notably, PSHGCN exhibits remarkable scalability, efficiently handling large real-world graphs comprising millions of nodes and edges.

However, its performance under varying network setups, especially when combined with IMU data for real-time localization, has not been fully explored so far. In this study, we develop an error state Kalman filter (ESKF) and a pose graph optimization (PGO) approach to address this gap. We systematically evaluate the performance of the derived approaches for real-time MAV localization in realistic scenarios with 5G base stations in Line-Of-Sight (LOS), demonstrating the potential of 5G technologies in this domain. In order to experimentally test and compare our localization approaches, we augment the EuRoC MAV benchmark dataset for visual-inertial odometry with simulated yet highly realistic 5G ToA measurements. Our experimental results comprehensively assess the impact of varying network setups, including varying base station numbers and network configurations, on ToA-based MAV localization performance. The findings show promising results for seamless and robust localization using 5G ToA measurements, achieving an accuracy of 15 cm throughout the entire trajectory within a graph-based framework with five 5G base stations, and an accuracy of up to 34 cm in the case of ESKF-based localization. Additionally, we measure the run time of both algorithms and show that they are both fast enough for real-time implementation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tightly-Coupled VLP/INS Integrated Navigation by Inclination Estimation and Blockage Handling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18105v1)** | 2024-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visible Light Positioning (VLP) has emerged as a promising technology capable of delivering indoor localization with high accuracy. In VLP systems that use Photodiodes (PDs) as light receivers, the Received Signal Strength (RSS) is affected by the incidence angle of light, making the inclination of PDs a critical parameter in the positioning model. Currently, most studies assume the inclination to be constant, limiting the applications and positioning accuracy. Additionally, light blockages may severely interfere with the RSS measurements but the literature has not explored blockage detection in real-world experiments. To address these problems, we propose a tightly coupled VLP/INS (Inertial Navigation System) integrated navigation system that uses graph optimization to account for varying PD inclinations and VLP blockages. We also discussed the possibility of simultaneously estimating the robot's pose and the locations of some unknown LEDs. Simulations and two groups of real-world experiments demonstrate the efficiency of our approach, achieving an average positioning accuracy of 10 cm during movement and inclination accuracy within 1 degree despite inclination changes and blockages.</p></details> |  |
| **[Proteus: Preserving Model Confidentiality during Graph Optimizations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12512v1)** | 2024-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning (DL) models have revolutionized numerous domains, yet optimizing them for computational efficiency remains a challenging endeavor. Development of new DL models typically involves two parties: the model developers and performance optimizers. The collaboration between the parties often necessitates the model developers exposing the model architecture and computational graph to the optimizers. However, this exposure is undesirable since the model architecture is an important intellectual property, and its innovations require significant investments and expertise. During the exchange, the model is also vulnerable to adversarial attacks via model stealing. This paper presents Proteus, a novel mechanism that enables model optimization by an independent party while preserving the confidentiality of the model architecture. Proteus obfuscates the protected model by partitioning its computational graph into subgraphs and concealing each subgraph within a large pool of generated realistic subgraphs that cannot be easily distinguished from the original. We evaluate Proteus on a range of DNNs, demonstrating its efficacy in preserving confidentiality without compromising performance optimization opportunities. Proteus effectively hides the model as one alternative among up to $10^{32}$ possible model architectures, and is resilient against attacks with a learning-based adversary. We also demonstrate that heuristic based and manual approaches are ineffective in identifying the protected model. To our knowledge, Proteus is the first work that tackles the challenge of model confidentiality during performance optimization. Proteus will be open-sourced for direct use and experimentation, with easy integration with compilers such as ONNXRuntime.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce a novel methodology that extends state-of-the-art Pose Graph Optimization (PGO) techniques. Departing from the conventional PGO paradigm, which primarily relies on camera-camera edges, our approach centers on the introduction of a dynamic element - any rigid object free to move in the scene - whose pose can be reliably inferred from a single image. Specifically, we consider the bipartite graph encompassing cameras, object poses evolving dynamically, and camera-object relative transformations at each time step. This shift not only offers a solution to the challenges encountered in directly estimating relative poses between cameras, particularly in adverse environments, but also leverages the inclusion of numerous object poses to ameliorate and integrate errors, resulting in accurate camera pose estimates. Though our framework retains compatibility with traditional PGO solvers, its efficacy benefits from a custom-tailored optimization scheme. To this end, we introduce an iterative primal-dual algorithm, capable of handling large graphs. Empirical benchmarks, conducted on a new dataset of simulated indoor environments, substantiate the efficacy and efficiency of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), 2024</p></details> |
| **[MV-ROPE: Multi-view Constraints for Robust Category-level Object Pose and Size Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08856v3)** | 2024-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently there has been a growing interest in category-level object pose and size estimation, and prevailing methods commonly rely on single view RGB-D images. However, one disadvantage of such methods is that they require accurate depth maps which cannot be produced by consumer-grade sensors. Furthermore, many practical real-world situations involve a moving camera that continuously observes its surroundings, and the temporal information of the input video streams is simply overlooked by single-view methods. We propose a novel solution that makes use of RGB video streams. Our framework consists of three modules: a scale-aware monocular dense SLAM solution, a lightweight object pose predictor, and an object-level pose graph optimizer. The SLAM module utilizes a video stream and additional scale-sensitive readings to estimate camera poses and metric depth. The object pose predictor then generates canonical object representations from RGB images. The object pose is estimated through geometric registration of these canonical object representations with estimated object depth points. All per-view estimates finally undergo optimization within a pose graph, culminating in the output of robust and accurate canonical object poses. Our experimental results demonstrate that when utilizing public dataset sequences with high-quality depth information, the proposed method exhibits comparable performance to state-of-the-art RGB-D methods. We also collect and evaluate on new datasets containing depth maps of varying quality to further quantitatively benchmark the proposed method alongside previous RGB-D based methods. We demonstrate a significant advantage in scenarios where depth input is absent or the quality of depth sensing is limited.</p></details> |  |
| **[iSLAM: Imperative SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07894v5)** | 2024-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) stands as one of the critical challenges in robot navigation. A SLAM system often consists of a front-end component for motion estimation and a back-end system for eliminating estimation drifts. Recent advancements suggest that data-driven methods are highly effective for front-end tasks, while geometry-based methods continue to be essential in the back-end processes. However, such a decoupled paradigm between the data-driven front-end and geometry-based back-end can lead to sub-optimal performance, consequently reducing the system's capabilities and generalization potential. To solve this problem, we proposed a novel self-supervised imperative learning framework, named imperative SLAM (iSLAM), which fosters reciprocal correction between the front-end and back-end, thus enhancing performance without necessitating any external supervision. Specifically, we formulate the SLAM problem as a bilevel optimization so that the front-end and back-end are bidirectionally connected. As a result, the front-end model can learn global geometric knowledge obtained through pose graph optimization by back-propagating the residuals from the back-end component. We showcase the effectiveness of this new framework through an application of stereo-inertial SLAM. The experiments show that the iSLAM training strategy achieves an accuracy improvement of 22% on average over a baseline model. To the best of our knowledge, iSLAM is the first SLAM system showing that the front-end and back-end components can mutually correct each other in a self-supervised manner.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been accepted by IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)</p></details> |

Most existing distributed graph optimization algorithms employ a simple sequential partitioning scheme, which may result in unbalanced subgraph dimensions due to the different geographic locations of each robot, and hence imposes extra communication load. Moreover, the performance of current Riemannian optimization algorithms can be further accelerated. In this letter, we propose a novel distributed pose graph optimization algorithm combining multi-level partitioning with an accelerated Riemannian optimization method. Firstly, we employ the multi-level graph partitioning algorithm to preprocess the naive pose graph to formulate a balanced optimization problem. In addition, inspired by the accelerated coordinate descent method, we devise an Improved Riemannian Block Coordinate Descent (IRBCD) algorithm and the critical point obtained is globally optimal. Finally, we evaluate the effects of four common graph partitioning approaches on the correlation of the inter-subgraphs, and discover that the Highest scheme has the best partitioning performance. Also, we implement simulations to quantitatively demonstrate that our proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art distributed pose graph optimization protocols.</p></details> |  |

The primary overhead of GNN update stems from graph propagation and weight transformation, both involving operations on graph-scale matrices. Previous studies attempt to reduce the computational budget by leveraging graph-level or network-level sparsification techniques, resulting in downsized graph or weights. In this work, we propose Unifews, which unifies the two operations in an entry-wise manner considering individual matrix elements, and conducts joint edge-weight sparsification to enhance learning efficiency. The entry-wise design of Unifews enables adaptive compression across GNN layers with progressively increased sparsity, and is applicable to a variety of architectural designs with on-the-fly operation simplification. Theoretically, we establish a novel framework to characterize sparsified GNN learning in view of a graph optimization process, and prove that Unifews effectively approximates the learning objective with bounded error and reduced computational load. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of our method in diverse settings. Unifews is advantageous in jointly removing more than 90% of edges and weight entries with comparable or better accuracy than baseline models. The sparsification offers remarkable efficiency improvements including 10-20x matrix operation reduction and up to 100x acceleration in graph propagation time for the largest graph at the billion-edge scale.</p></details> |  |

However, in real-world environments with dynamic objects, existing 3DGS-based SLAM systems often face mapping errors and tracking drift issues. To address these problems, we propose GARAD-SLAM, a real-time 3DGS-based SLAM system tailored for dynamic scenes. In terms of tracking, unlike traditional methods, we directly perform dynamic segmentation on Gaussians and map them back to the front-end to obtain dynamic point labels through a Gaussian pyramid network, achieving precise dynamic removal and robust tracking. For mapping, we impose rendering penalties on dynamically labeled Gaussians, which are updated through the network, to avoid irreversible erroneous removal caused by simple pruning. Our results on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method is competitive in tracking compared to baseline methods, generating fewer artifacts and higher-quality reconstructions in rendering.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper was accepted by ICRA 2025</p></details> |

Although effective for accurate visual odometry in complex scenarios, these methods discard crucial information about moving objects. By incorporating this information into a Dynamic SLAM framework, the motion of dynamic entities can be estimated, enhancing navigation whilst ensuring accurate localization. However, the fundamental formulation of Dynamic SLAM remains an open challenge, with no consensus on the optimal approach for accurate motion estimation within a SLAM pipeline. Therefore, we developed DynoSAM, an open-source framework for Dynamic SLAM that enables the efficient implementation, testing, and comparison of various Dynamic SLAM optimization formulations. DynoSAM integrates static and dynamic measurements into a unified optimization problem solved using factor graphs, simultaneously estimating camera poses, static scene, object motion or poses, and object structures. We evaluate DynoSAM across diverse simulated and real-world datasets, achieving state-of-the-art motion estimation in indoor and outdoor environments, with substantial improvements over existing systems. Additionally, we demonstrate DynoSAM utility in downstream applications, including 3D reconstruction of dynamic scenes and trajectory prediction, thereby showcasing potential for advancing dynamic object-aware SLAM systems. DynoSAM is open-sourced at https://github.com/ACFR-RPG/DynOSAM.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 10 figures. Submitted to T-RO Visual SLAM SI 2025</p></details> |
| **[TivNe-SLAM: Dynamic Mapping and Tracking via Time-Varying Neural Radiance Fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18917v7)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Previous attempts to integrate Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) into the Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) framework either rely on the assumption of static scenes or require the ground truth camera poses, which impedes their application in real-world scenarios. This paper proposes a time-varying representation to track and reconstruct the dynamic scenes. Firstly, two processes, a tracking process and a mapping process, are maintained simultaneously in our framework. In the tracking process, all input images are uniformly sampled and then progressively trained in a self-supervised paradigm. In the mapping process, we leverage motion masks to distinguish dynamic objects from the static background, and sample more pixels from dynamic areas. Secondly, the parameter optimization for both processes is comprised of two stages: the first stage associates time with 3D positions to convert the deformation field to the canonical field. The second stage associates time with the embeddings of the canonical field to obtain colors and a Signed Distance Function (SDF). Lastly, we propose a novel keyframe selection strategy based on the overlapping rate. Our approach is evaluated on two synthetic datasets and one real-world dataset, and the experiments validate that our method achieves competitive results in both tracking and mapping when compared to existing state-of-the-art NeRF-based dynamic SLAM systems.</p></details> |  |

While recent advancements in dense SLAM have leveraged Gaussian Splatting to enhance scene representation, most approaches assume a static environment, making them vulnerable to photometric and geometric inconsistencies caused by dynamic objects. To address these challenges, we integrate Gaussian Splatting SLAM with a robust filtering process to handle dynamic objects throughout the entire pipeline, including Gaussian insertion and keyframe selection. Within this framework, to further improve the accuracy of dynamic object removal, we introduce a robust mask generation method that enforces photometric consistency across keyframes, reducing noise from inaccurate segmentation and artifacts such as shadows. Additionally, we propose the loop-aware window selection mechanism, which utilizes unique keyframe IDs of 3D Gaussians to detect loops between the current and past frames, facilitating joint optimization of the current camera poses and the Gaussian map. DGS-SLAM achieves state-of-the-art performance in both camera tracking and novel view synthesis on various dynamic SLAM benchmarks, proving its effectiveness in handling real-world dynamic scenes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, Under review</p></details> |

However, their performance significantly deteriorates when deployed in settings with a higher presence of movable objects, such as environments with pedestrians, cars, and buses, which are common in outdoor scenes. To address this issue, we propose a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)-based real-time stereo SLAM system that leverages complete geometry information to avoid information loss. Moreover, there is currently no publicly available dataset for directly evaluating the effectiveness of dynamic and static feature classification methods, and to bridge this gap, we have created a publicly available dataset containing over 50,000 feature points. Experimental results demonstrate that our MLP-based dynamic and static feature point discriminator has achieved superior performance compared to other methods on this dataset. Furthermore, the MLP-based real-time stereo SLAM system has shown the highest average precision and fastest speed on the outdoor KITTI tracking datasets compared to other dynamic SLAM systems.The open-source code and datasets are available at https://github.com/TaozheLi/MLP-SLAM.</p></details> | Dynamic SLAM |

To enable robots to safely navigate and plan in dynamic environments, it is essential to employ representations capable of handling moving objects. Dynamic SLAM is an emerging field in SLAM research as it improves the overall system accuracy while providing additional estimation of object motions. State-of-the-art literature informs two main formulations for Dynamic SLAM, representing dynamic object points in either the world or object coordinate frame. While expressing object points in a local reference frame may seem intuitive, it may not necessarily lead to the most accurate and robust solutions. This paper conducts and presents a thorough analysis of various Dynamic SLAM formulations, identifying the best approach to address the problem. To this end, we introduce a front-end agnostic framework using GTSAM that can be used to evaluate various Dynamic SLAM formulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, accepted by ICRA 2024</p></details> |

However, they usually require GPUs to operate in real-time. Therefore, this paper proposes an open-source real-time dynamic SLAM system that runs solely on CPU by incorporating a mask prediction mechanism, which allows the deep learning method and the camera tracking to run entirely in parallel at different frequencies. Our SLAM system further introduces a dual-stage optical flow tracking approach and employs a hybrid usage of optical flow and ORB features, enhancing efficiency and robustness by selectively allocating computational resources to input frames. Compared with previous methods, our system maintains high localization accuracy in dynamic environments while achieving a tracking frame rate of 56 FPS on a laptop CPU, proving that deep learning methods are feasible for dynamic SLAM without GPU support. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first SLAM system to achieve this.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |

However, deploying such a system within a dynamic environment has not been well-studied. Such challenges are intractable even for conventional algorithms since observations from different views with dynamic objects involved break the geometric and photometric consistency, whereas the consistency lays the foundation for joint optimizing the camera pose and the map parameters. In this paper, we best exploit the characteristics of continual learning and propose a novel SLAM framework for dynamic environments. While past efforts have been made to avoid catastrophic forgetting by exploiting an experience replay strategy, we view forgetting as a desirable characteristic. By adaptively controlling the replayed buffer, the ambiguity caused by moving objects can be easily alleviated through forgetting. We restrain the replay of the dynamic objects by introducing a continually-learned classifier for dynamic object identification. The iterative optimization of the neural map and the classifier notably improves the robustness of the SLAM system under a dynamic environment. Experiments on challenging datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

However, this approach relies on a static environment assumption and does not work robustly within a dynamic environment due to the inconsistent observation of geometry and photometry. To address the challenges presented in dynamic environments, we propose a novel dynamic SLAM framework with neural radiance field. Specifically, we introduce a motion mask generation method to filter out the invalid sampled rays. This design effectively fuses the optical flow mask and semantic mask to enhance the precision of motion mask. To further improve the accuracy of pose estimation, we have designed a divide-and-conquer pose optimization algorithm that distinguishes between keyframes and non-keyframes. The proposed edge warp loss can effectively enhance the geometry constraints between adjacent frames. Extensive experiments are conducted on the two challenging datasets, and the results show that RoDyn-SLAM achieves state-of-the-art performance among recent neural RGB-D methods in both accuracy and robustness.</p></details> | IEEE RAL 2024 |

While large strides have been made towards developing dynamic SLAM approaches that estimate the robot pose accurately, a lesser emphasis has been put on the construction of dense spatio-temporal representations of the robot environment. A detailed understanding of the scene and its evolution through time is crucial for long-term robot autonomy and essential to tasks that require long-term reasoning, such as operating effectively in environments shared with humans and other agents and thus are subject to short and long-term dynamics. To address this challenge, this work defines the Spatio-temporal Metric-semantic SLAM (SMS) problem, and presents a framework to factorize and solve it efficiently. We show that the proposed factorization suggests a natural organization of a spatio-temporal perception system, where a fast process tracks short-term dynamics in an active temporal window, while a slower process reasons over long-term changes in the environment using a factor graph formulation. We provide an efficient implementation of the proposed spatio-temporal perception approach, that we call Khronos, and show that it unifies exiting interpretations of short-term and long-term dynamics and is able to construct a dense spatio-temporal map in real-time. We provide simulated and real results, showing that the spatio-temporal maps built by Khronos are an accurate reflection of a 3D scene over time and that Khronos outperforms baselines across multiple metrics. We further validate our approach on two heterogeneous robots in challenging, large-scale real-world environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Robotics: Science and Systems, 2024.

This paper develops a real-time multi-object tracking and prediction system in rugged environments. A 3D object detection algorithm based on Lidar-camera fusion is designed to detect the target objects.

However, they lack either full simulation control, ROS integration, realistic physics, or photorealism. Recently, synthetic data generation and realistic rendering has advanced tasks like target tracking and human pose estimation. However, when focusing on vision applications, there is usually a lack of information like sensor measurements or time continuity. On the other hand, simulations for most robotics tasks are performed in (semi)static environments, with specific sensors and low visual fidelity. To solve this, we introduced in our previous work a fully customizable framework for generating realistic animated dynamic environments (GRADE) [1]. We use GRADE to generate an indoor dynamic environment dataset and then compare multiple SLAM algorithms on different sequences. By doing that, we show how current research over-relies on known benchmarks, failing to generalize.

Most dynamic SLAM approaches either remove dynamic objects as outliers when they account for a minor proportion of the visual input, or detect dynamic objects using semantic segmentation before camera tracking. Therefore, dynamic objects that cause large occlusions are difficult to detect without prior information. The remaining visual information from the static background is also not enough to support localisation when large occlusion lasts for a long period. To overcome these problems, our framework presents a robust visual-inertial bundle adjustment that simultaneously tracks camera, estimates cluster-wise dense segmentation of dynamic objects and maintains a static sparse map by combining dense and sparse features. The experiment results demonstrate that our method achieves promising localisation and object segmentation performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods in the scenario of long-term large occlusion.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |

Recent SLAM frameworks have been proposed to simultaneously track the camera and moving objects. However they are often unable to estimate the canonical pose of the objects and exhibit a low object tracking accuracy. To solve this problem we propose TwistSLAM++, a semantic, dynamic, SLAM system that fuses stereo images and LiDAR information. Using semantic information, we track potentially moving objects and associate them to 3D object detections in LiDAR scans to obtain their pose and size. Then, we perform registration on consecutive object scans to refine object pose estimation. Finally, object scans are used to estimate the shape of the object and constrain map points to lie on the estimated surface within the BA. We show on classical benchmarks that this fusion approach based on multimodal information improves the accuracy of object tracking.</p></details> |  |

Many of these applications require autonomous agents to perform SLAM in highly dynamic scenes. To this end, this tutorial extends a recently introduced, unifying optimization-based SLAM backend framework to environments with moving objects and features. Using this framework, we consider a rapprochement of recent advances in dynamic SLAM. Moreover, we present dynamic EKF SLAM: a novel, filtering-based dynamic SLAM algorithm generated from our framework, and prove that it is mathematically equivalent to a direct extension of the classical EKF SLAM algorithm to the dynamic environment setting. Empirical results with simulated data indicate that dynamic EKF SLAM can achieve high localization and mobile object pose estimation accuracy, as well as high map precision, with high efficiency.</p></details> |  |

While learning-based dynamic SLAM systems have difficulties in handling unknown moving objects, geometry-based methods have limited success in addressing the residual effects of unidentified dynamic objects on location estimation. To address these issues, we propose an anti-dynamics two-stage SLAM approach. Firstly, the potential motion regions of both prior and non-prior dynamic objects are extracted and pose estimates for dynamic discrimination are quickly obtained using optical flow tracking and model generation methods. Secondly, dynamic points in each frame are removed through dynamic judgment. For non-prior dynamic objects, we present a approach that uses super-pixel extraction and geometric clustering to determine the potential motion regions based on color and geometric information in the image. Evaluations on multiple low and high dynamic sequences in a public RGB-D dataset show that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art dynamic SLAM methods.</p></details> |  |

Previous dynamic SLAM methods either rely on semantic segmentation to directly detect dynamic objects; or assume that dynamic objects occupy a smaller proportion of the camera view than the static background and can, therefore, be removed as outliers. Our approach, however, enables dense SLAM when the camera view is largely occluded by multiple dynamic objects with the aid of camera motion prior. The dynamic planar objects are separated by their different rigid motions and tracked independently. The remaining dynamic non-planar areas are removed as outliers and not mapped into the background. The evaluation demonstrates that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of localisation, mapping, dynamic segmentation and object tracking. We also demonstrate its robustness to large drift in the camera motion prior.</p></details> | 8 papges, 9 figures |

Dynamic 3D object tracking has then become a significant capability in visual SLAM with the requirement of understanding dynamic surroundings in various scenarios including autonomous driving, augmented and virtual reality. However, performing dynamic SLAM solely with monocular images remains a challenging problem due to the difficulty of associating dynamic features and estimating their positions. In this paper, we present MOTSLAM, a dynamic visual SLAM system with the monocular configuration that tracks both poses and bounding boxes of dynamic objects. MOTSLAM first performs multiple object tracking (MOT) with associated both 2D and 3D bounding box detection to create initial 3D objects. Then, neural-network-based monocular depth estimation is applied to fetch the depth of dynamic features. Finally, camera poses, object poses, and both static, as well as dynamic map points, are jointly optimized using a novel bundle adjustment. Our experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that our system has reached best performance on both camera ego-motion and object tracking on monocular dynamic SLAM.</p></details> |  |

Several SLAM systems with impressive performance have been invented and used during the last several decades. However, there are still unresolved issues, such as how to deal with moving objects in dynamic situations. Classic SLAM systems depend on the assumption of a static environment, which becomes unworkable in highly dynamic situations. Several methods have been presented to tackle this issue in recent years, but each has its limitations. This research combines the visual SLAM systems ORB-SLAM3 and Detectron2 to present the Det-SLAM system, which employs depth information and semantic segmentation to identify and eradicate dynamic spots to accomplish semantic SLAM for dynamic situations. Evaluation of public TUM datasets indicates that Det-SLAM is more resilient than previous dynamic SLAM systems and can lower the estimated error of camera posture in dynamic indoor scenarios.</p></details> | 5 pages, 2 figures |

Existing methods mainly focus on identifying and excluding dynamic objects from the optimization. In this paper, we show that feature-based visual SLAM systems can also benefit from the presence of dynamic articulated objects by taking advantage of two observations: (1) The 3D structure of each rigid part of articulated object remains consistent over time; (2) The points on the same rigid part follow the same motion. In particular, we present AirDOS, a dynamic object-aware system that introduces rigidity and motion constraints to model articulated objects. By jointly optimizing the camera pose, object motion, and the object 3D structure, we can rectify the camera pose estimation, preventing tracking loss, and generate 4D spatio-temporal maps for both dynamic objects and static scenes. Experiments show that our algorithm improves the robustness of visual SLAM algorithms in challenging crowded urban environments. To the best of our knowledge, AirDOS is the first dynamic object-aware SLAM system demonstrating that camera pose estimation can be improved by incorporating dynamic articulated objects.</p></details> |  |

Even in extremely dynamic scenes, it can robustly optimise for the camera pose, velocity, IMU biases and build a dense 3D reconstruction object-level map of the environment. Our system can robustly track and reconstruct the geometries of arbitrary objects, their semantics and motion by incrementally fusing associated colour, depth, semantic, and foreground object probabilities into each object model thanks to its robust sensor and object tracking. In addition, when an object is lost or moved outside the camera field of view, our system can reliably recover its pose upon re-observation. We demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of our method by quantitatively and qualitatively testing it in real-world data sequences.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) 2022</p></details> |
| **[RF-LIO: Removal-First Tightly-coupled Lidar Inertial Odometry in High Dynamic Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.09463v1)** | 2022-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is considered to be an essential capability for intelligent vehicles and mobile robots. However, most of the current lidar SLAM approaches are based on the assumption of a static environment. Hence the localization in a dynamic environment with multiple moving objects is actually unreliable. The paper proposes a dynamic SLAM framework RF-LIO, building on LIO-SAM, which adds adaptive multi-resolution range images and uses tightly-coupled lidar inertial odometry to first remove moving objects, and then match lidar scan to the submap. Thus, it can obtain accurate poses even in high dynamic environments. The proposed RF-LIO is evaluated on both self-collected datasets and open Urbanloco datasets. The experimental results in high dynamic environments demonstrate that, compared with LOAM and LIO-SAM, the absolute trajectory accuracy of the proposed RF-LIO can be improved by 90% and 70%, respectively. RF-LIO is one of the state-of-the-art SLAM systems in high dynamic environments.</p></details> |  |

Currently, several approaches achieve the avoidance of static obstacles based on the mapping of indoor scenes. To solve the issue of distinguishing dynamic obstacles, we propose an assistive system with an RGB-D sensor to detect dynamic information of a scene. Once the system captures an image, panoptic segmentation is performed to obtain the prior dynamic object information. With sparse feature points extracted from images and the depth information, poses of the user can be estimated. After the ego-motion estimation, the dynamic object can be identified and tracked. Then, poses and speed of tracked dynamic objects can be estimated, which are passed to the users through acoustic feedback.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCHP 2022</p></details> |

Recently, some related works generally use the combination of semantic constraints and geometric constraints to deal with dynamic objects, but problems can still be raised, such as poor real-time performance, easy to treat people as rigid bodies, and poor performance in low dynamic scenes. In this paper, a dynamic scene-oriented visual SLAM algorithm based on object detection and coarse-to-fine static probability named CFP-SLAM is proposed. The algorithm combines semantic constraints and geometric constraints to calculate the static probability of objects, keypoints and map points, and takes them as weights to participate in camera pose estimation. Extensive evaluations show that our approach can achieve almost the best results in high dynamic and low dynamic scenarios compared to the state-of-the-art dynamic SLAM methods, and shows quite high real-time ability.</p></details> |  |

The motion of rigid objects can be typically tracked by exploiting their texture and geometric features. However, humans moving in the scene are often one of the most important, interactive targets - they are very hard to track and reconstruct robustly due to non-rigid shapes. In this work, we present a fast, learning-based human object detector to isolate the dynamic human objects and realise a real-time dense background reconstruction framework. We go further by estimating and reconstructing the human pose and shape. The final output environment maps not only provide the dense static backgrounds but also contain the dynamic human meshes and their trajectories. Our Dynamic SLAM system runs at around 26 frames per second (fps) on GPUs, while additionally turning on accurate human pose estimation can be executed at up to 10 fps.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IROS-2021</p></details> |

Most prior efforts, however, often assume that the target object's CAD model, at least at a category-level, is available for offline training or during online template matching. This work proposes BundleTrack, a general framework for 6D pose tracking of novel objects, which does not depend upon 3D models, either at the instance or category-level. It leverages the complementary attributes of recent advances in deep learning for segmentation and robust feature extraction, as well as memory-augmented pose graph optimization for spatiotemporal consistency. This enables long-term, low-drift tracking under various challenging scenarios, including significant occlusions and object motions. Comprehensive experiments given two public benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-art, category-level 6D tracking or dynamic SLAM methods. When compared against state-of-art methods that rely on an object instance CAD model, comparable performance is achieved, despite the proposed method's reduced information requirements. An efficient implementation in CUDA provides a real-time performance of 10Hz for the entire framework. Code is available at: https://github.com/wenbowen123/BundleTrack</p></details> |  |

We present a novel semantic SLAM approach that leverages road elements such as lane boundaries, traffic signs, and road markings to enhance localization accuracy. Our system integrates real-time semantic feature detection with a graph optimization framework, effectively handling both rolling-shutter effects and INS drift. Using a practical hardware setup which consists of a rolling-shutter camera (3840*2160@30fps), IMU (100Hz), and wheel encoder (50Hz), we demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods. Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, our method achieves higher recall (up to 5.35\%) and precision (up to 2.79\%) in semantic element detection, while maintaining mean relative error (MRE) within 10cm and mean absolute error (MAE) around 1m. Extensive experiments in diverse urban environments demonstrate the robust performance of our system under varying lighting conditions and complex traffic scenarios, making it particularly suitable for autonomous driving applications. The proposed approach provides a practical solution for high-precision localization using affordable hardware, bridging the gap between consumer-grade sensors and production-level performance requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE IV'25</p></details> |

However, previous methods are generally constrained by limited-category pre-trained classifiers and implicit semantic representation, which hinder their performance in open-set scenarios and restrict 3D object-level scene understanding. To address these issues, we propose OpenGS-SLAM, an innovative framework that utilizes 3D Gaussian representation to perform dense semantic SLAM in open-set environments. Our system integrates explicit semantic labels derived from 2D foundational models into the 3D Gaussian framework, facilitating robust 3D object-level scene understanding. We introduce Gaussian Voting Splatting to enable fast 2D label map rendering and scene updating. Additionally, we propose a Confidence-based 2D Label Consensus method to ensure consistent labeling across multiple views. Furthermore, we employ a Segmentation Counter Pruning strategy to improve the accuracy of semantic scene representation. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in scene understanding, tracking, and mapping, achieving 10 times faster semantic rendering and 2 times lower storage costs compared to existing methods.

However, existing Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) methods generally focus on either geometric or semantic reconstruction. In this paper, we introduce PanoSLAM, the first SLAM system to integrate geometric reconstruction, 3D semantic segmentation, and 3D instance segmentation within a unified framework. Our approach builds upon 3D Gaussian Splatting, modified with several critical components to enable efficient rendering of depth, color, semantic, and instance information from arbitrary viewpoints. To achieve panoptic 3D scene reconstruction from sequential RGB-D videos, we propose an online Spatial-Temporal Lifting (STL) module that transfers 2D panoptic predictions from vision models into 3D Gaussian representations. This STL module addresses the challenges of label noise and inconsistencies in 2D predictions by refining the pseudo labels across multi-view inputs, creating a coherent 3D representation that enhances segmentation accuracy. Our experiments show that PanoSLAM outperforms recent semantic SLAM methods in both mapping and tracking accuracy. For the first time, it achieves panoptic 3D reconstruction of open-world environments directly from the RGB-D video. (https://github.com/runnanchen/PanoSLAM)</p></details> |  |

The framework integrates a data-driven front-end for instance segmentation from either RGBD cameras or LiDARs and a custom back-end for optimizing robot trajectories and object landmarks in the map. To allow multiple robots to merge their information, we design semantics-driven place recognition algorithms that leverage the informativeness and viewpoint invariance of the object-level metric-semantic map for inter-robot loop closure detection. A communication module is designed to track each robot's observations and those of other robots whenever communication links are available. Our framework enables real-time decentralized operations onboard robots, allowing them to leverage communication opportunistically. We integrate the proposed framework with the autonomous navigation and exploration systems of three types of aerial and ground robots, conducting extensive experiments in a variety of indoor and outdoor environments.

This paper presents an object-based semantic SLAM method for underwater environments that can identify, localize, classify, and map a wide variety of marine objects without a priori knowledge of the object classes present in the scene. The method performs unsupervised object segmentation and object-level feature aggregation, and then uses opti-acoustic sensor fusion for object localization. Probabilistic data association is used to determine observation to landmark correspondences. Given such correspondences, the method then jointly optimizes landmark and vehicle position estimates. Indoor and outdoor underwater datasets with a wide variety of objects and challenging acoustic and lighting conditions are collected for evaluation and made publicly available. Quantitative and qualitative results show the proposed method achieves reduced trajectory error compared to baseline methods, and is able to obtain comparable map accuracy to a baseline closed-set method that requires hand-labeled data of all objects in the scene.</p></details> | <details><summary>Minor...</summary><p>Minor typo tixes and clarifications</p></details> |

A robot's exploration behavior can be inherently affected by the performance of its Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) subsystem, although SLAM and exploration are generally studied separately. In this paper, we formulate exploration as an active mapping problem and extend it with semantic information. We introduce a novel active metric-semantic SLAM approach, leveraging recent research advances in information theory and spectral graph theory: we combine semantic mutual information and the connectivity metrics of the underlying pose graph of the SLAM subsystem. We use the resulting utility function to evaluate different trajectories to select the most favorable strategy during exploration. Exploration and SLAM metrics are analyzed in experiments. Running our algorithm on the Habitat dataset, we show that, while maintaining efficiency close to the state-of-the-art exploration methods, our approach effectively increases the performance of metric-semantic SLAM with a 21% reduction in average map error and a 9% improvement in average semantic classification accuracy.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

Commonly, 3D semantic reconstruction systems capture the entire scene in the same level of detail. However, certain tasks (e.g., object interaction) require a fine-grained and high-resolution map, particularly if the objects to interact are of small size or intricate geometry. In recent practice, this leads to the entire map being in the same high-quality resolution, which results in increased computational and storage costs. To address this challenge, we propose MAP-ADAPT, a real-time method for quality-adaptive semantic 3D reconstruction using RGBD frames. MAP-ADAPT is the first adaptive semantic 3D mapping algorithm that, unlike prior work, generates directly a single map with regions of different quality based on both the semantic information and the geometric complexity of the scene. Leveraging a semantic SLAM pipeline for pose and semantic estimation, we achieve comparable or superior results to state-of-the-art methods on synthetic and real-world data, while significantly reducing storage and computation requirements.</p></details> |  |

In this system, we incorporate semantic feature embedding into 3D Gaussian representation, which effectively encodes semantic information within the spatial layout of the environment for precise semantic scene representation. Furthermore, we propose feature-level loss for updating 3D Gaussian representation, enabling higher-level guidance for 3D Gaussian optimization. In addition, to reduce cumulative drift in tracking and improve semantic reconstruction accuracy, we introduce semantic-informed bundle adjustment leveraging multi-frame semantic associations for joint optimization of 3D Gaussian representation and camera poses, leading to low-drift tracking and accurate mapping. Our SemGauss-SLAM method demonstrates superior performance over existing radiance field-based SLAM methods in terms of mapping and tracking accuracy on Replica and ScanNet datasets, while also showing excellent capabilities in high-precision semantic segmentation and dense semantic mapping.</p></details> |  |

While large strides have been made towards developing dynamic SLAM approaches that estimate the robot pose accurately, a lesser emphasis has been put on the construction of dense spatio-temporal representations of the robot environment. A detailed understanding of the scene and its evolution through time is crucial for long-term robot autonomy and essential to tasks that require long-term reasoning, such as operating effectively in environments shared with humans and other agents and thus are subject to short and long-term dynamics. To address this challenge, this work defines the Spatio-temporal Metric-semantic SLAM (SMS) problem, and presents a framework to factorize and solve it efficiently. We show that the proposed factorization suggests a natural organization of a spatio-temporal perception system, where a fast process tracks short-term dynamics in an active temporal window, while a slower process reasons over long-term changes in the environment using a factor graph formulation. We provide an efficient implementation of the proposed spatio-temporal perception approach, that we call Khronos, and show that it unifies exiting interpretations of short-term and long-term dynamics and is able to construct a dense spatio-temporal map in real-time. We provide simulated and real results, showing that the spatio-temporal maps built by Khronos are an accurate reflection of a 3D scene over time and that Khronos outperforms baselines across multiple metrics. We further validate our approach on two heterogeneous robots in challenging, large-scale real-world environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Robotics: Science and Systems, 2024.

In this system, we introduce hierarchical semantic representation to allow multi-level semantic comprehension for top-down structured semantic mapping of the scene. In addition, to fully utilize the correlation between multiple attributes of the environment, we integrate appearance, geometry and semantic features through cross-attention for feature collaboration. This strategy enables a more multifaceted understanding of the environment, thereby allowing SNI-SLAM to remain robust even when single attribute is defective. Then, we design an internal fusion-based decoder to obtain semantic, RGB, Truncated Signed Distance Field (TSDF) values from multi-level features for accurate decoding. Furthermore, we propose a feature loss to update the scene representation at the feature level. Compared with low-level losses such as RGB loss and depth loss, our feature loss is capable of guiding the network optimization on a higher-level. Our SNI-SLAM method demonstrates superior performance over all recent NeRF-based SLAM methods in terms of mapping and tracking accuracy on Replica and ScanNet datasets, while also showing excellent capabilities in accurate semantic segmentation and real-time semantic mapping.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2024</p></details> |
| **[SD-SLAM: A Semantic SLAM Approach for Dynamic Scenes Based on LiDAR Point Clouds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18318v1)** | 2024-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Point cloud maps generated via LiDAR sensors using extensive remotely sensed data are commonly used by autonomous vehicles and robots for localization and navigation. However, dynamic objects contained in point cloud maps not only downgrade localization accuracy and navigation performance but also jeopardize the map quality. In response to this challenge, we propose in this paper a novel semantic SLAM approach for dynamic scenes based on LiDAR point clouds, referred to as SD-SLAM hereafter. The main contributions of this work are in three aspects: 1) introducing a semantic SLAM framework dedicatedly for dynamic scenes based on LiDAR point clouds, 2) Employing semantics and Kalman filtering to effectively differentiate between dynamic and semi-static landmarks, and 3) Making full use of semi-static and pure static landmarks with semantic information in the SD-SLAM process to improve localization and mapping performance. To evaluate the proposed SD-SLAM, tests were conducted using the widely adopted KITTI odometry dataset. Results demonstrate that the proposed SD-SLAM effectively mitigates the adverse effects of dynamic objects on SLAM, improving vehicle localization and mapping performance in dynamic scenes, and simultaneously constructing a static semantic map with multiple semantic classes for enhanced environment understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[3D Active Metric-Semantic SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06950v3)** | 2024-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this letter, we address the problem of exploration and metric-semantic mapping of multi-floor GPS-denied indoor environments using Size Weight and Power (SWaP) constrained aerial robots. Most previous work in exploration assumes that robot localization is solved. However, neglecting the state uncertainty of the agent can ultimately lead to cascading errors both in the resulting map and in the state of the agent itself. Furthermore, actions that reduce localization errors may be at direct odds with the exploration task. We propose a framework that balances the efficiency of exploration with actions that reduce the state uncertainty of the agent. In particular, our algorithmic approach for active metric-semantic SLAM is built upon sparse information abstracted from raw problem data, to make it suitable for SWaP-constrained robots. Furthermore, we integrate this framework within a fully autonomous aerial robotic system that achieves autonomous exploration in cluttered, 3D environments. From extensive real-world experiments, we showed that by including Semantic Loop Closure (SLC), we can reduce the robot pose estimation errors by over 90% in translation and approximately 75% in yaw, and the uncertainties in pose estimates and semantic maps by over 70% and 65%, respectively. Although discussed in the context of indoor multi-floor exploration, our system can be used for various other applications, such as infrastructure inspection and precision agriculture where reliable GPS data may not be available.</p></details> | Accepted by RA-L |
| **[Preferential Multi-Target Search in Indoor Environments using Semantic SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14063v3)** | 2024-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the demand for service robots capable of executing tasks beyond autonomous navigation has grown. In the future, service robots will be expected to perform complex tasks like 'Set table for dinner'. High-level tasks like these, require, among other capabilities, the ability to retrieve multiple targets. This paper delves into the challenge of locating multiple targets in an environment, termed 'Find my Objects.' We present a novel heuristic designed to facilitate robots in conducting a preferential search for multiple targets in indoor spaces. Our approach involves a Semantic SLAM framework that combines semantic object recognition with geometric data to generate a multi-layered map. We fuse the semantic maps with probabilistic priors for efficient inferencing. Recognizing the challenges introduced by obstacles that might obscure a navigation goal and render standard point-to-point navigation strategies less viable, our methodology offers resilience to such factors. Importantly, our method is adaptable to various object detectors, RGB-D SLAM techniques, and local navigation planners. We demonstrate the 'Find my Objects' task in real-world indoor environments, yielding quantitative results that attest to the effectiveness of our methodology. This strategy can be applied in scenarios where service robots need to locate, grasp, and transport objects, taking into account user preferences.

Additionally, Kimera-RPGO and Kimera-PGMO, Kimera's pose-graph optimization backends, are updated to support modern outlier rejection methods - specifically, Graduated-Non-Convexity - for improved robustness to spurious loop closures. These new features are evaluated extensively on a variety of simulated and real robotic platforms, including drones, quadrupeds, wheeled robots, and simulated self-driving cars. We present comparisons against several state-of-the-art visual-inertial SLAM pipelines and discuss strengths and weaknesses of the new release of Kimera.

While achieving impressive performance on small synthetic scenes, these methods often suffer from oversmoothed reconstructions, especially for complex real-world scenes. In this work, we introduce DNS SLAM, a novel neural RGB-D semantic SLAM approach featuring a hybrid representation. Relying only on 2D semantic priors, we propose the first semantic neural SLAM method that trains class-wise scene representations while providing stable camera tracking at the same time. Our method integrates multi-view geometry constraints with image-based feature extraction to improve appearance details and to output color, density, and semantic class information, enabling many downstream applications. To further enable real-time tracking, we introduce a lightweight coarse scene representation which is trained in a self-supervised manner in latent space. Our experimental results achieve state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic data and real-world data tracking while maintaining a commendable operational speed on off-the-shelf hardware. Further, our method outputs class-wise decomposed reconstructions with better texture capturing appearance and geometric details.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Accurate Loop Closure Detection in Semantic SLAM with 3D Semantic Covisibility Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12245v1)** | 2023-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Loop closure is necessary for correcting errors accumulated in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) in unknown environments. However, conventional loop closure methods based on low-level geometric or image features may cause high ambiguity by not distinguishing similar scenarios. Thus, incorrect loop closures can occur. Though semantic 2D image information is considered in some literature to detect loop closures, there is little work that compares 3D scenes as an integral part of a semantic SLAM system. This paper introduces an approach, called SmSLAM+LCD, integrated into a semantic SLAM system to combine high-level 3D semantic information and low-level feature information to conduct accurate loop closure detection and effective drift reduction. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated in testing results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Autonomous Search of Semantic Objects in Unknown Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13236v2)** | 2023-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the problem of enabling a robot to search for a semantic object, i.e., an object with a semantic label, in an unknown and GPS-denied environment. For the robot in the unknown environment to detect and find the target semantic object, it must perform simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) at both geometric and semantic levels using its onboard sensors while planning and executing its motion based on the ever-updated SLAM results. In other words, the robot must be able to conduct simultaneous localization, semantic mapping, motion planning, and execution in real-time in the presence of sensing and motion uncertainty. This is an open problem as it combines semantic SLAM based on perception and real-time motion planning and execution under uncertainty. Moreover, the goals of the robot motion change on the fly depending on whether and how the robot can detect the target object. We propose a novel approach to tackle the problem, leveraging semantic SLAM, Bayesian Networks, Markov Decision Process, and Real-Time Dynamic Programming. The results in simulation and real experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[3DS-SLAM: A 3D Object Detection based Semantic SLAM towards Dynamic Indoor Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06385v1)** | 2023-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The existence of variable factors within the environment can cause a decline in camera localization accuracy, as it violates the fundamental assumption of a static environment in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms. Recent semantic SLAM systems towards dynamic environments either rely solely on 2D semantic information, or solely on geometric information, or combine their results in a loosely integrated manner. In this research paper, we introduce 3DS-SLAM, 3D Semantic SLAM, tailored for dynamic scenes with visual 3D object detection. The 3DS-SLAM is a tightly-coupled algorithm resolving both semantic and geometric constraints sequentially. We designed a 3D part-aware hybrid transformer for point cloud-based object detection to identify dynamic objects. Subsequently, we propose a dynamic feature filter based on HDBSCAN clustering to extract objects with significant absolute depth differences. When compared against ORB-SLAM2, 3DS-SLAM exhibits an average improvement of 98.01% across the dynamic sequences of the TUM RGB-D dataset. Furthermore, it surpasses the performance of the other four leading SLAM systems designed for dynamic environments.</p></details> |  |

This representation is storage-efficient, less ambiguous, and more informative, thus facilitating large-scale autonomy and the acquisition of actionable information in highly unstructured, GPS-denied environments. In this letter, we propose an integrated system that can perform large-scale autonomous flights and real-time semantic mapping in challenging under-canopy environments. We detect and model tree trunks and ground planes from LiDAR data, which are associated across scans and used to constrain robot poses as well as tree trunk models. The autonomous navigation module utilizes a multi-level planning and mapping framework and computes dynamically feasible trajectories that lead the UAV to build a semantic map of the user-defined region of interest in a computationally and storage efficient manner. A drift-compensation mechanism is designed to minimize the odometry drift using semantic SLAM outputs in real time, while maintaining planner optimality and controller stability. This leads the UAV to execute its mission accurately and safely at scale.</p></details> | <details><summary>Xu Li...</summary><p>Xu Liu and Guilherme V.

One of the key implicit assumptions when solving cooperative multi-robot problems is that all robots use the same (homogeneous) underlying algorithm. However, in practice, we want to allow collaboration between robots possessing different capabilities and that therefore must rely on heterogeneous algorithms. We present a system architecture and the supporting theory, to enable collaboration in a decentralized network of robots, where each robot relies on different estimation algorithms. To develop our approach, we focus on multi-robot simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) with multi-target tracking. Our theoretical framework builds on our idea of exploiting the conditional independence structure inherent to many robotics applications to separate between each robot's local inference (estimation) tasks and fuse only relevant parts of their non-equal, but overlapping probability density function (pdfs). We present a new decentralized graph-based approach to the multi-robot SLAM and tracking problem. We leverage factor graphs to split between different parts of the problem for efficient data sharing between robots in the network while enabling robots to use different local sparse landmark/dense/metric-semantic SLAM algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures, presented at the ICRA 2023 workshop on "Distributed Graph Algorithms for Robotics"</p></details> |
| **[Neural Implicit Dense Semantic SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14560v2)** | 2023-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (vSLAM) is a widely used technique in robotics and computer vision that enables a robot to create a map of an unfamiliar environment using a camera sensor while simultaneously tracking its position over time. In this paper, we propose a novel RGBD vSLAM algorithm that can learn a memory-efficient, dense 3D geometry, and semantic segmentation of an indoor scene in an online manner. Our pipeline combines classical 3D vision-based tracking and loop closing with neural fields-based mapping. The mapping network learns the SDF of the scene as well as RGB, depth, and semantic maps of any novel view using only a set of keyframes. Additionally, we extend our pipeline to large scenes by using multiple local mapping networks. Extensive experiments on well-known benchmark datasets confirm that our approach provides robust tracking, mapping, and semantic labeling even with noisy, sparse, or no input depth. Overall, our proposed algorithm can greatly enhance scene perception and assist with a range of robot control problems.</p></details> |  |

Most CSLAM techniques rely on the transmission of low-level features for visual and LiDAR-based approaches, which are used for pose graph optimization. However, these low-level features can lead to incorrect loop closures, negatively impacting map generation.Recent approaches have proposed the use of high-level semantic information in the form of Hierarchical Semantic Graphs to improve the loop closure procedures and overall precision of SLAM algorithms. In this work, we present Multi S-Graphs, an S-graphs [1] based distributed CSLAM algorithm that utilizes high-level semantic information for cooperative map generation while minimizing the amount of information exchanged between robots.

Recent SLAM frameworks have been proposed to simultaneously track the camera and moving objects. However they are often unable to estimate the canonical pose of the objects and exhibit a low object tracking accuracy. To solve this problem we propose TwistSLAM++, a semantic, dynamic, SLAM system that fuses stereo images and LiDAR information. Using semantic information, we track potentially moving objects and associate them to 3D object detections in LiDAR scans to obtain their pose and size. Then, we perform registration on consecutive object scans to refine object pose estimation. Finally, object scans are used to estimate the shape of the object and constrain map points to lie on the estimated surface within the BA. We show on classical benchmarks that this fusion approach based on multimodal information improves the accuracy of object tracking.</p></details> |  |

Several SLAM systems with impressive performance have been invented and used during the last several decades. However, there are still unresolved issues, such as how to deal with moving objects in dynamic situations. Classic SLAM systems depend on the assumption of a static environment, which becomes unworkable in highly dynamic situations. Several methods have been presented to tackle this issue in recent years, but each has its limitations. This research combines the visual SLAM systems ORB-SLAM3 and Detectron2 to present the Det-SLAM system, which employs depth information and semantic segmentation to identify and eradicate dynamic spots to accomplish semantic SLAM for dynamic situations. Evaluation of public TUM datasets indicates that Det-SLAM is more resilient than previous dynamic SLAM systems and can lower the estimated error of camera posture in dynamic indoor scenarios.</p></details> | 5 pages, 2 figures |

Quadrics and cubes are often used to represent objects, but their single shape limits the accuracy of object map and thus affects the application of downstream tasks. In this paper, we introduce superquadrics (SQ) with shape parameters into SLAM for representing objects, and propose a separate parameter estimation method that can accurately estimate object pose and adapt to different shapes. Furthermore, we present a lightweight data association strategy for correctly associating semantic observations in multiple views with object landmarks. We implement a monocular semantic SLAM system with real-time performance and conduct comprehensive experiments on public datasets. The results show that our method is able to build accurate object map and has advantages in object representation.

The objects may be moved by inhabitants, but not completely at random. The robot may be called upon later to retrieve objects and will need a long-term object-based memory in order to know how to find them. Existing work in semantic slam does not attempt to capture the dynamics of object movement. In this paper, we combine some aspects of classic techniques for data-association filtering with modern attention-based neural networks to construct object-based memory systems that operate on high-dimensional observations and hypotheses. We perform end-to-end learning on labeled observation trajectories to learn both the transition and observation models. We demonstrate the system's effectiveness in maintaining memory of dynamically changing objects in both simulated environment and real images, and demonstrate improvements over classical structured approaches as well as unstructured neural approaches.

One of the challenges in this field is to obtain object classification jointly with robot trajectory estimation. Considering view-dependent semantic measurements, there is a coupling between different classes, resulting in a combinatorial number of hypotheses. A common solution is to prune hypotheses that have a sufficiently low probability and to retain only a limited number of hypotheses. However, after pruning and renormalization, the updated probability is overconfident with respect to the original probability. This is especially problematic for systems that require high accuracy. If the prior probability of the classes is independent, the original normalization factor can be computed efficiently without pruning hypotheses. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to present these results. If the prior probability of the classes is dependent, we propose a lower bound on the normalization factor that ensures cautious results. The bound is calculated incrementally and with similar efficiency as in the independent case. After pruning and updating based on the bound, this belief is shown empirically to be close to the original belief.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 12 figures, accepted to IROS</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose the use of an efficient representation, based on structural points, for the geometry of objects to be used as landmarks in a monocular semantic SLAM system based on the pose-graph formulation. In particular, an inverse depth parametrization is proposed for the landmark nodes in the pose-graph to store object position, orientation and size/scale. The proposed formulation is general and it can be applied to different geometries; in this paper we focus on indoor environments where human-made artifacts commonly share a planar rectangular shape, e.g., windows, doors, cabinets, etc. The approach can be easily extended to urban scenarios where similar shapes exists as well. Experiments in simulation show good performance, particularly in object geometry reconstruction.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to IROS 2015 (rejected)</p></details> |

Recently, however, the community has realized that progress towards robust intelligent systems such as self-driving cars requires a concerted effort across the different fields. This motivated us to develop KITTI-360, successor of the popular KITTI dataset. KITTI-360 is a suburban driving dataset which comprises richer input modalities, comprehensive semantic instance annotations and accurate localization to facilitate research at the intersection of vision, graphics and robotics. For efficient annotation, we created a tool to label 3D scenes with bounding primitives and developed a model that transfers this information into the 2D image domain, resulting in over 150k images and 1B 3D points with coherent semantic instance annotations across 2D and 3D. Moreover, we established benchmarks and baselines for several tasks relevant to mobile perception, encompassing problems from computer vision, graphics, and robotics on the same dataset, e.g., semantic scene understanding, novel view synthesis and semantic SLAM. KITTI-360 will enable progress at the intersection of these research areas and thus contribute towards solving one of today's grand challenges: the development of fully autonomous self-driving systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1511.03240</p></details> |
| **[Multi-modal Semantic SLAM for Complex Dynamic Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04300v2)** | 2022-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is one of the most essential techniques in many real-world robotic applications. The assumption of static environments is common in most SLAM algorithms, which however, is not the case for most applications. Recent work on semantic SLAM aims to understand the objects in an environment and distinguish dynamic information from a scene context by performing image-based segmentation. However, the segmentation results are often imperfect or incomplete, which can subsequently reduce the quality of mapping and the accuracy of localization. In this paper, we present a robust multi-modal semantic framework to solve the SLAM problem in complex and highly dynamic environments. We propose to learn a more powerful object feature representation and deploy the mechanism of looking and thinking twice to the backbone network, which leads to a better recognition result to our baseline instance segmentation model. Moreover, both geometric-only clustering and visual semantic information are combined to reduce the effect of segmentation error due to small-scale objects, occlusion and motion blur. Thorough experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The results show that our method can precisely identify dynamic objects under recognition imperfection and motion blur. Moreover, the proposed SLAM framework is able to efficiently build a static dense map at a processing rate of more than 10 Hz, which can be implemented in many practical applications. Both training data and the proposed method is open sourced at https://github.com/wh200720041/MMS_SLAM.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present a method for semantic dense reconstruction of the OR scene using multiple RGB-D cameras attached and registered to the da Vinci Xi surgical system. We developed a novel SLAM approach for robot pose tracking in dynamic OR environments and dense reconstruction of the static OR table object. We validated our techniques in a mock OR by collecting data sequences with corresponding optical tracking trajectories as ground truth and manually annotated 100 frame segmentation masks. The mean absolute trajectory error is $11.4\pm1.9$ mm and the mean relative pose error is $1.53\pm0.48$ degrees per second. The segmentation DICE score is improved from 0.814 to 0.902 by using our SLAM system compared to single frame. Our approach effectively produces a dense OR table reconstruction in dynamic clinical environments as well as improved semantic segmentation on individual image frames.</p></details> |  |

Previously, SLAM was carried out using lower level geometric features (points, lines, and planes) which are often view-point dependent and error prone in visually repetitive environments. Semantic information can improve the ability to recognise previously visited locations, as well as maintain sparser maps for long term SLAM applications. However, SLAM in repetitive environments has the critical problem of assigning measurements to the landmarks which generated them. In this paper, we use k-best assignment enumeration to compute marginal assignment probabilities for each measurement landmark pair, in real time.

The environment is assumed to have known geometric structure (e.g., walls) and to be occupied by static labeled landmarks with uncertain positions and classes. This modeling approach gives rise to an uncertain semantic map generated by semantic SLAM algorithms. Our goal is to design control policies for robots equipped with noisy perception systems so that they can accomplish collaborative tasks captured by global temporal logic specifications. To specify missions that account for environmental and perceptual uncertainty, we employ a fragment of Linear Temporal Logic (LTL), called co-safe LTL, defined over perception-based atomic predicates modeling probabilistic satisfaction requirements. The perception-based LTL planning problem gives rise to an optimal control problem, solved by a novel sampling-based algorithm, that generates open-loop control policies that are updated online to adapt to a continuously learned semantic map. We provide extensive experiments to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed planning architecture.</p></details> |  |
| **[Accurate Object Association and Pose Updating for Semantic SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.11368v3)** | 2021-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current pandemic has caused the medical system to operate under high load. To relieve it, robots with high autonomy can be used to effectively execute contactless operations in hospitals and reduce cross-infection between medical staff and patients. Although semantic Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) technology can improve the autonomy of robots, semantic object association is still a problem that is worthy of being studied. The key to solving this problem is to correctly associate multiple object measurements of one object landmark by using semantic information, and to refine the pose of object landmark in real time. To this end, we propose a hierarchical object association strategy and a pose-refinement approach. The former one consists of two levels, i.e., a short-term object association and a global one. In the first level, we employ the multiple-object-tracking for short-term object association, through which the incorrect association among objects whose locations are close and appearances are similar can be avoided. Moreover, the short-term object association can provide more abundant object appearance and more robust estimation of object pose for the global object association in the second level. To refine the object pose in the map, we develop an approach to choose the optimal object pose from all object measurements associated with an object landmark. The proposed method is comprehensively evaluated on seven simulated hospital sequences1, a real hospital environment and the KITTI dataset. Experimental results show that our method has an obviously improvement in terms of robustness and accuracy for the object association and the trajectory estimation in the semantic SLAM.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

Kimera-Multi is implemented by a team of robots equipped with visual-inertial sensors. Each robot builds a local trajectory estimate and a local mesh using Kimera. When communication is available, robots initiate a distributed place recognition and robust pose graph optimization protocol based on a novel distributed graduated non-convexity algorithm. The proposed protocol allows the robots to improve their local trajectory estimates by leveraging inter-robot loop closures while being robust to outliers. Finally, each robot uses its improved trajectory estimate to correct the local mesh using mesh deformation techniques. We demonstrate Kimera-Multi in photo-realistic simulations, SLAM benchmarking datasets, and challenging outdoor datasets collected using ground robots. Both real and simulated experiments involve long trajectories (e.g., up to 800 meters per robot). The experiments show that Kimera-Multi (i) outperforms the state of the art in terms of robustness and accuracy, (ii) achieves estimation errors comparable to a centralized SLAM system while being fully distributed, (iii) is parsimonious in terms of communication bandwidth, (iv) produces accurate metric-semantic 3D meshes, and (v) is modular and can be also used for standard 3D reconstruction (i.e., without semantic labels) or for trajectory estimation (i.e., without reconstructing a 3D mesh).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Robotics (18 pages, 15 figures)</p></details> |
| **[Superquadric Object Representation for Optimization-based Semantic SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.09627v1)** | 2021-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Introducing semantically meaningful objects to visual Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) has the potential to improve both the accuracy and reliability of pose estimates, especially in challenging scenarios with significant view-point and appearance changes. However, how semantic objects should be represented for an efficient inclusion in optimization-based SLAM frameworks is still an open question. Superquadrics(SQs) are an efficient and compact object representation, able to represent most common object types to a high degree, and typically retrieved from 3D point-cloud data. However, accurate 3D point-cloud data might not be available in all applications. Recent advancements in machine learning enabled robust object recognition and semantic mask measurements from camera images under many different appearance conditions. We propose a pipeline to leverage such semantic mask measurements to fit SQ parameters to multi-view camera observations using a multi-stage initialization and optimization procedure. We demonstrate the system's ability to retrieve randomly generated SQ parameters from multi-view mask observations in preliminary simulation experiments and evaluate different initialization stages and cost functions.</p></details> |  |

We obtain these results by providing algorithms with ground-truth pose and/or semantic segmentation data available from simulated environments.

The goal is to detect corn stalks and localize them in a global coordinate frame. This is a challenging setup for existing algorithms because there is very little space between the camera and the plants, and the camera motion is primarily restricted to be along the row. To overcome these challenges, we present a multi-camera system where a side camera (facing the plants) is used for detection whereas front and back cameras are used for motion estimation. Next, we show how semantic features in the environment (corn stalks, ground, and crop planes) can be used to develop a robust semantic SLAM solution and present results from field trials performed throughout the growing season across various cornfields.</p></details> | 7 pages, 6 figures |

We contribute a unified framework for inference and belief space planning (BSP) that addresses prominent sources of uncertainty in this context: classification aliasing (classier cannot distinguish between candidate classes from certain viewpoints), classifier epistemic uncertainty (classifier receives data "far" from its training set), and localization uncertainty (camera and object poses are uncertain). Specifically, we develop two methods for maintaining a joint distribution over robot and object poses, and over posterior class probability vector that considers epistemic uncertainty in a Bayesian fashion. The first approach is Multi-Hybrid (MH), where multiple hybrid beliefs over poses and classes are maintained to approximate the joint belief over poses and posterior class probability. The second approach is Joint Lambda Pose (JLP), where the joint belief is maintained directly using a novel JLP factor. Furthermore, we extend both methods to BSP, planning while reasoning about future posterior epistemic uncertainty indirectly, or directly via a novel information-theoretic reward function. Both inference methods utilize a novel viewpoint-dependent classifier uncertainty model that leverages the coupling between poses and classification scores and predicts the epistemic uncertainty from certain viewpoints. In addition, this model is used to generate predicted measurements during planning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that reasons about classifier epistemic uncertainty within semantic SLAM and BSP.</p></details> | <details><summary>44 pa...</summary><p>44 pages, 38 figures, submitted to Autonomous Robots Journal (ARJ)</p></details> |
| **[SuMa++: Efficient LiDAR-based Semantic SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.11320v1)** | 2021-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reliable and accurate localization and mapping are key components of most autonomous systems. Besides geometric information about the mapped environment, the semantics plays an important role to enable intelligent navigation behaviors. In most realistic environments, this task is particularly complicated due to dynamics caused by moving objects, which can corrupt the mapping step or derail localization. In this paper, we propose an extension of a recently published surfel-based mapping approach exploiting three-dimensional laser range scans by integrating semantic information to facilitate the mapping process. The semantic information is efficiently extracted by a fully convolutional neural network and rendered on a spherical projection of the laser range data. This computed semantic segmentation results in point-wise labels for the whole scan, allowing us to build a semantically-enriched map with labeled surfels. This semantic map enables us to reliably filter moving objects, but also improve the projective scan matching via semantic constraints. Our experimental evaluation on challenging highways sequences from KITTI dataset with very few static structures and a large amount of moving cars shows the advantage of our semantic SLAM approach in comparison to a purely geometric, state-of-the-art approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IROS 2019.

| **[Multiple Hypothesis Semantic Mapping for Robust Data Association](http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.04423v1)** | 2020-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present a semantic mapping approach with multiple hypothesis tracking for data association. As semantic information has the potential to overcome ambiguity in measurements and place recognition, it forms an eminent modality for autonomous systems. This is particularly evident in urban scenarios with several similar looking surroundings. Nevertheless, it requires the handling of a non-Gaussian and discrete random variable coming from object detectors. Previous methods facilitate semantic information for global localization and data association to reduce the instance ambiguity between the landmarks. However, many of these approaches do not deal with the creation of complete globally consistent representations of the environment and typically do not scale well. We utilize multiple hypothesis trees to derive a probabilistic data association for semantic measurements by means of position, instance and class to create a semantic representation. We propose an optimized mapping method and make use of a pose graph to derive a novel semantic SLAM solution. Furthermore, we show that semantic covisibility graphs allow for a precise place recognition in urban environments. We verify our approach using real-world outdoor dataset and demonstrate an average drift reduction of 33 % w.r.t. the raw odometry source. Moreover, our approach produces 55 % less hypotheses on average than a regular multiple hypotheses approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semantic SLAM with Autonomous Object-Level Data Association](http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.10625v1)** | 2020-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is often desirable to capture and map semantic information of an environment during simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Such semantic information can enable a robot to better distinguish places with similar low-level geometric and visual features and perform high-level tasks that use semantic information about objects to be manipulated and environments to be navigated. While semantic SLAM has gained increasing attention, there is little research on semanticlevel data association based on semantic objects, i.e., object-level data association. In this paper, we propose a novel object-level data association algorithm based on bag of words algorithm, formulated as a maximum weighted bipartite matching problem. With object-level data association solved, we develop a quadratic-programming-based semantic object initialization scheme using dual quadric and introduce additional constraints to improve the success rate of object initialization. The integrated semantic-level SLAM system can achieve high-accuracy object-level data association and real-time semantic mapping as demonstrated in the experiments. The online semantic map building and semantic-level localization capabilities facilitate semantic-level mapping and task planning in a priori unknown environment.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose an ensemble data associate strategy for integrating the parametric and nonparametric statistic tests. By exploiting the nature of different statistics, our method can effectively aggregate the information of different measurements, and thus significantly improve the robustness and accuracy of data association. We then present an accurate object pose estimation framework, in which an outliers-robust centroid and scale estimation algorithm and an object pose initialization algorithm are developed to help improve the optimality of pose estimation results. Furthermore, we build a SLAM system that can generate semi-dense or lightweight object-oriented maps with a monocular camera. Extensive experiments are conducted on three publicly available datasets and a real scenario. The results show that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in accuracy and robustness.

In particular, we utilize a viewpoint-dependent classifier model to leverage the coupling between semantics and geometry. Moreover, our approach yields a consistent estimation of both continuous and discrete variables, with the latter being addressed for the first time, to the best of our knowledge. We evaluate the performance of our approach in a multi-robot semantic SLAM simulation and in a real-world experiment, demonstrating an increase in both classification and localization accuracy compared to maintaining a hybrid belief using local information only.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 73 figures, for an associated video, see https://youtu.be/jATog1snfwc</p></details> |

The library goes beyond existing visual and visual-inertial SLAM libraries (e.g., ORB-SLAM, VINS- Mono, OKVIS, ROVIO) by enabling mesh reconstruction and semantic labeling in 3D. Kimera is designed with modularity in mind and has four key components: a visual-inertial odometry (VIO) module for fast and accurate state estimation, a robust pose graph optimizer for global trajectory estimation, a lightweight 3D mesher module for fast mesh reconstruction, and a dense 3D metric-semantic reconstruction module. The modules can be run in isolation or in combination, hence Kimera can easily fall back to a state-of-the-art VIO or a full SLAM system. Kimera runs in real-time on a CPU and produces a 3D metric-semantic mesh from semantically labeled images, which can be obtained by modern deep learning methods. We hope that the flexibility, computational efficiency, robustness, and accuracy afforded by Kimera will build a solid basis for future metric-semantic SLAM and perception research, and will allow researchers across multiple areas (e.g., VIO, SLAM, 3D reconstruction, segmentation) to benchmark and prototype their own efforts without having to start from scratch.</p></details> | 8 pages |

Traditional SLAM approaches rely heavily on low-level geometric constraints like corners or lines, which may lead to tracking failure in textureless surroundings or cluttered world with dynamic objects. In this paper, a compact semantic SLAM framework is proposed, with utilization of both geometric and object-level semantic constraints jointly, a more consistent mapping result, and more accurate pose estimation can be obtained. Two main contributions are presented int the paper, a) a robust and efficient SLAM data association and optimization framework is proposed, it models both discrete semantic labeling and continuous pose. b) a compact map representation, combining 2D Lidar map with object detection is presented. Experiments on public indoor datasets, TUM-RGBD, ICL-NUIM, and our own collected datasets prove the improving of SLAM robustness and accuracy compared to other popular SLAM systems, meanwhile a map maintenance efficiency can be achieved.</p></details> | 8 pages, 11 figures |

We aim to develop robots that can use all of these sources of information for reliable navigation, but each is corrupted by noise. Rather than assume that object detection will eventually achieve near perfect performance across the lifetime of a robot, in this work we represent and cope with the semantic and geometric uncertainty inherent in methods like object detection. Specifically, we model data association ambiguity, which is typically non-Gaussian, in a way that is amenable to solution within the common nonlinear Gaussian formulation of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). We do so by eliminating data association variables from the inference process through max-marginalization, preserving standard Gaussian posterior assumptions. The result is a max-mixture-type model that accounts for multiple data association hypotheses as well as incorrect loop closures. We provide experimental results on indoor and outdoor semantic navigation tasks with noisy odometry and object detection and find that the ability of the proposed approach to represent multiple hypotheses, including the "null" hypothesis, gives substantial robustness advantages in comparison to alternative semantic SLAM approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Autho...</summary><p>Authors D.

While sparse point-based SLAM methods provide accurate camera localization, the generated maps lack semantic information. On the other hand, state of the art object detection methods provide rich information about entities present in the scene from a single image. This work incorporates a real-time deep-learned object detector to the monocular SLAM framework for representing generic objects as quadrics that permit detections to be seamlessly integrated while allowing the real-time performance. Finer reconstruction of an object, learned by a CNN network, is also incorporated and provides a shape prior for the quadric leading further refinement. To capture the dominant structure of the scene, additional planar landmarks are detected by a CNN-based plane detector and modeled as independent landmarks in the map. Extensive experiments support our proposed inclusion of semantic objects and planar structures directly in the bundle-adjustment of SLAM - Semantic SLAM - that enriches the reconstructed map semantically, while significantly improving the camera localization.

When ambiguous measurements arise, conservatism often mandates that the measurement is discarded or a new landmark is initialized rather than risking an incorrect association. To address the inevitable `duplicate' landmarks that arise, we present an efficient map-merging framework to detect duplicate constellations of landmarks, providing a high-confidence loop-closure mechanism well-suited for object-level SLAM. This approach uses an incrementally-computable approximation of landmark uncertainty that only depends on local information in the SLAM graph, avoiding expensive recovery of the full system covariance matrix. This enables a search based on geometric consistency (GC) (rather than full joint compatibility (JC)) that inexpensively reduces the search space to a handful of `best' hypotheses. Furthermore, we reformulate the commonly-used interpretation tree to allow for more efficient integration of clique-based pairwise compatibility, accelerating the branch-and-bound max-cardinality search. Our method is demonstrated to match the performance of full JC methods at significantly-reduced computational cost, facilitating robust object-based loop-closure over large SLAM problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) 2019</p></details> |

Recent studies on object detection and feature extraction have become important for scene understanding and 3D mapping. However, 3D shape of the object is too complex to formulate the probabilistic observation model; therefore, performing the Bayesian inference of the object-oriented features as well as their pose is less considered. Besides, when the robot equipped with an RGB mono camera only observes the projected single view of an object, a significant amount of the 3D shape information is abandoned. Due to these limitations, semantic SLAM and viewpoint-independent loop closure using volumetric 3D object shape is challenging. In order to enable the complete formulation of probabilistic semantic SLAM, we approximate the observation model of a 3D object with a tractable distribution. We also estimate the variational likelihood from the 2D image of the object to exploit its observed single view.

Recent approaches to object recognition methods become important for semantic simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). However, there is a lack of consideration of the probabilistic observation model for 3D objects, as the shape of a 3D object basically follows a complex probability distribution. Furthermore, since the mobile robot equipped with a range sensor observes only a single view, much information of the object shape is discarded. These limitations are the major obstacles to semantic SLAM and view-independent loop closure using 3D object shapes as features. In order to enable the numerical analysis for the Bayesian inference, we approximate the true observation model of 3D objects to tractable distributions. Since the observation likelihood can be obtained from the generative model, we formulate the true generative model for 3D object with the Bayesian networks. To capture these complex distributions, we apply a variational auto-encoder. To analyze the approximated distributions and encoded features, we perform classification with maximum likelihood estimation and shape retrieval.</p></details> | <details><summary>to ap...</summary><p>to appear in the proceedings of IROS 2018</p></details> |

While previous 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS)-based methods largely depended on depth sensors, our approach reduces the hardware dependency and only requires RGB input, leveraging online visual odometry (VO) to generate sparse point clouds in real-time. To reduce redundancy and enhance the quality of 3D scene reconstruction, we implemented a series of methodological enhancements in 3D Gaussian mapping. Firstly, we introduced dynamic 3D Gaussian insertion to avoid adding redundant Gaussians in previously well-reconstructed areas. Secondly, we introduced clarity-enhancing Gaussian densification module and planar regularization to handle texture-less areas and flat surfaces better. We achieved precise camera tracking results both on the synthetic Replica and real-world TUM-RGBD datasets, comparable to those of the state-of-the-art. Additionally, our method realized a significant 5.57x improvement in frames per second (fps) over the previous state-of-the-art, MonoGS.</p></details> |  |

However, these systems often encounter incomplete reconstructions in complex indoor environments, characterized by substantial holes due to unobserved geometry caused by obstacles or limited view angles. To address this challenge, we present Manhattan Gaussian SLAM, an RGB-D system that leverages the Manhattan World hypothesis to enhance geometric accuracy and completeness. By seamlessly integrating fused line segments derived from structured scenes, our method ensures robust tracking in textureless indoor areas. Moreover, The extracted lines and planar surface assumption allow strategic interpolation of new Gaussians in regions of missing geometry, enabling efficient scene completion. Extensive experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world scenes demonstrate that these advancements enable our method to achieve state-of-the-art performance, marking a substantial improvement in the capabilities of Gaussian SLAM systems.</p></details> |  |

The parameter usage in semantic SLAM systems increases significantly with the growing complexity of the environment, making scene understanding particularly challenging and costly. To address this problem, we introduce a novel and general hierarchical representation that encodes both semantic and geometric information in a compact form into 3D Gaussian Splatting, leveraging the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) as well as the 3D generative model. By utilizing the proposed hierarchical tree structure, semantic information is symbolically represented and learned in an end-to-end manner. We further introduce a novel semantic loss designed to optimize hierarchical semantic information through both inter-level and cross-level optimization. Additionally, we propose an improved SLAM system to support both RGB-D and monocular inputs using a feed-forward model.

However, their reliance on extensive keyframes is impractical for deployment in real-world robotic systems, which typically operate under sparse-view conditions that can result in substantial holes in the map. To address these challenges, we introduce DenseSplat, the first SLAM system that effectively combines the advantages of NeRF and 3DGS. DenseSplat utilizes sparse keyframes and NeRF priors for initializing primitives that densely populate maps and seamlessly fill gaps. It also implements geometry-aware primitive sampling and pruning strategies to manage granularity and enhance rendering efficiency. Moreover, DenseSplat integrates loop closure and bundle adjustment, significantly enhancing frame-to-frame tracking accuracy. Extensive experiments on multiple large-scale datasets demonstrate that DenseSplat achieves superior performance in tracking and mapping compared to current state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

The framework comprises four main components: VIO Front End, 2D Gaussian Map, NVS Loop Closure, and Dynamic Eraser. In the VIO Front End, RGB frames are processed through dense bundle adjustment and uncertainty estimation to extract scene geometry and poses. Based on this output, the mapping module incrementally constructs and maintains a 2D Gaussian map. Key components of the 2D Gaussian Map include a Sample-based Rasterizer, Score Manager, and Pose Refinement, which collectively improve mapping speed and localization accuracy. This enables the SLAM system to handle large-scale urban environments with up to 50 million Gaussian ellipsoids. To ensure global consistency in large-scale scenes, we design a Loop Closure module, which innovatively leverages the Novel View Synthesis (NVS) capabilities of Gaussian Splatting for loop closure detection and correction of the Gaussian map. Additionally, we propose a Dynamic Eraser to address the inevitable presence of dynamic objects in real-world outdoor scenes. Extensive evaluations in indoor and outdoor environments demonstrate that our approach achieves localization performance on par with Visual-Inertial Odometry while surpassing recent GS/NeRF SLAM methods. It also significantly outperforms all existing methods in terms of mapping and rendering quality. Furthermore, we developed a mobile app and verified that our framework can generate high-quality Gaussian maps in real time using only a smartphone camera and a low-frequency IMU sensor. To the best of our knowledge, VINGS-Mono is the first monocular Gaussian SLAM method capable of operating in outdoor environments and supporting kilometer-scale large scenes.</p></details> |  |

However, existing Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) methods generally focus on either geometric or semantic reconstruction. In this paper, we introduce PanoSLAM, the first SLAM system to integrate geometric reconstruction, 3D semantic segmentation, and 3D instance segmentation within a unified framework. Our approach builds upon 3D Gaussian Splatting, modified with several critical components to enable efficient rendering of depth, color, semantic, and instance information from arbitrary viewpoints. To achieve panoptic 3D scene reconstruction from sequential RGB-D videos, we propose an online Spatial-Temporal Lifting (STL) module that transfers 2D panoptic predictions from vision models into 3D Gaussian representations. This STL module addresses the challenges of label noise and inconsistencies in 2D predictions by refining the pseudo labels across multi-view inputs, creating a coherent 3D representation that enhances segmentation accuracy. Our experiments show that PanoSLAM outperforms recent semantic SLAM methods in both mapping and tracking accuracy. For the first time, it achieves panoptic 3D reconstruction of open-world environments directly from the RGB-D video. (https://github.com/runnanchen/PanoSLAM)</p></details> |  |

Existing Neural SLAM or 3DGS-based SLAM methods often trade off between rendering quality and geometry accuracy, our research demonstrates that both can be achieved simultaneously with RGB input alone. The key idea of our approach is to enhance the ability for geometry estimation by combining easy-to-obtain monocular priors with learning-based dense SLAM, and then using 3D Gaussian splatting as our core map representation to efficiently model the scene. Upon loop closure, our method ensures on-the-fly global consistency through efficient pose graph bundle adjustment and instant map updates by explicitly deforming the 3D Gaussian units based on anchored keyframe updates. Furthermore, we introduce a grid-based scale alignment strategy to maintain improved scale consistency in prior depths for finer depth details. Through extensive experiments on Replica, ScanNet, and ScanNet++, we demonstrate significant improvements over existing Neural SLAM methods and even surpass RGB-D-based methods in both reconstruction and rendering quality.

Pose-free scene reconstruction from incomplete, unposed observations is usually regularized with depth estimation or 3D foundational priors. While recent advances have enabled sparse-view reconstruction of unbounded scenes with known camera poses using diffusion priors, these methods rely on explicit camera embeddings for extrapolating unobserved regions. This reliance limits their application in pose-free settings, where view-specific data is only implicitly available. To address this, we propose an instruction-following RGBD diffusion model designed to inpaint missing details and remove artifacts in novel view renders and depth maps of a 3D scene. We also propose a novel confidence measure for Gaussian representations to allow for better detection of these artifacts. By progressively integrating these novel views in a Gaussian-SLAM-inspired process, we achieve a multi-view-consistent Gaussian representation. Evaluations on the MipNeRF360 dataset demonstrate that our method surpasses existing pose-free techniques and performs competitively with state-of-the-art posed reconstruction methods in complex $360^{\circ}$ scenes.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

However, current methods either lack dense depth maps to supervise the mapping process or detailed training designs that consider the scale of the environment. To address these drawbacks, we present IG-SLAM, a dense RGB-only SLAM system that employs robust Dense-SLAM methods for tracking and combines them with Gaussian Splatting. A 3D map of the environment is constructed using accurate pose and dense depth provided by tracking. Additionally, we utilize depth uncertainty in map optimization to improve 3D reconstruction. Our decay strategy in map optimization enhances convergence and allows the system to run at 10 fps in a single process. We demonstrate competitive performance with state-of-the-art RGB-only SLAM systems while achieving faster operation speeds. We present our experiments on the Replica, TUM-RGBD, ScanNet, and EuRoC datasets.

Existing methods have achieved encouraging results on RGB-D SLAM, but studies of the monocular case are still scarce. Moreover, they also fail to correct drift errors due to the lack of loop closure and global optimization. In this paper, we present MG-SLAM, a monocular Gaussian SLAM with a language-extended loop closure module capable of performing drift-corrected tracking and high-fidelity reconstruction while achieving a high-level understanding of the environment. Our key idea is to represent the global map as 3D Gaussian and use it to guide the estimation of the scene geometry, thus mitigating the efforts of missing depth information. Further, an additional language-extended loop closure module which is based on CLIP feature is designed to continually perform global optimization to correct drift errors accumulated as the system runs. Our system shows promising results on multiple challenging datasets in both tracking and mapping and even surpasses some existing RGB-D methods.</p></details> |  |

The system features a compact Gaussian representation and a highly efficient on-the-fly Gaussian optimization scheme. We force each Gaussian to be either opaque or nearly transparent, with the opaque ones fitting the surface and dominant colors, and transparent ones fitting residual colors. By rendering depth in a different way from color rendering, we let a single opaque Gaussian well fit a local surface region without the need of multiple overlapping Gaussians, hence largely reducing the memory and computation cost. For on-the-fly Gaussian optimization, we explicitly add Gaussians for three types of pixels per frame: newly observed, with large color errors, and with large depth errors. We also categorize all Gaussians into stable and unstable ones, where the stable Gaussians are expected to well fit previously observed RGBD images and otherwise unstable. We only optimize the unstable Gaussians and only render the pixels occupied by unstable Gaussians. In this way, both the number of Gaussians to be optimized and pixels to be rendered are largely reduced, and the optimization can be done in real time. We show real-time reconstructions of a variety of large scenes. Compared with the state-of-the-art NeRF-based RGBD SLAM, our system achieves comparable high-quality reconstruction but with around twice the speed and half the memory cost, and shows superior performance in the realism of novel view synthesis and camera tracking accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in ACM SIGGRAPH 2024</p></details> |

However, real-time full posterior inference techniques, such as Gaussian approximation and particle filters, either lack expressiveness for representing non-Gaussian posteriors or suffer from performance degeneracy when estimating high-dimensional posteriors. Inspired by the complementary strengths of Gaussian approximation and particle filters$\unicode{x2013}$scalability and non-Gaussian estimation, respectively$\unicode{x2013}$we blend these two approaches to infer marginal posteriors in SLAM. Specifically, Gaussian approximation provides robot pose distributions on which particle filters are conditioned to sample landmark marginals. In return, the maximum a posteriori point among these samples can be used to reset linearization points in the nonlinear optimization solver of the Gaussian approximation, facilitating the pursuit of global optima. We demonstrate the scalability, generalizability, and accuracy of our algorithm for real-time full posterior inference on realworld range-only SLAM and object-based bearing-only SLAM datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures.

| **[Nested Sampling for Non-Gaussian Inference in SLAM Factor Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.10871v3)** | 2022-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present nested sampling for factor graphs (NSFG), a novel nested sampling approach to approximate inference for posterior distributions expressed over factor-graphs. Performing such inference is a key step in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Although the Gaussian approximation often works well, in other more challenging SLAM situations, the posterior distribution is non-Gaussian and cannot be explicitly represented with standard distributions. Our technique applies to settings where the posterior distribution is substantially non-Gaussian (e.g., multi-modal) and thus needs a more expressive representation. NSFG exploits nested sampling methods to directly sample the posterior to represent the distribution without parametric density models. While nested sampling methods are known for their powerful capability in sampling multi-modal distributions, the application of the methods to SLAM factor graphs is not straightforward. NSFG leverages the structure of factor graphs to construct informative prior distributions which are efficiently sampled and provide notable computational benefits for nested sampling methods. We present simulated experiments which demonstrate that NSFG is more robust and computes solutions over an order of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art sampling techniques. Similarly, we compare NSFG to state-of-the-art Gaussian and non-Gaussian SLAM approaches and demonstrate that NSFG is notably more robust in describing non-Gaussian posteriors.</p></details> |  |

Therefore, the multi-modal methods that combine both modalities offer more robust detection results. However, efficiently fusing LiDAR points and images remains challenging due to the domain gaps. In addition, the performance of many models is limited by the amount of high quality labeled data, which is expensive to create. The recent advances in foundation models, which use large-scale pre-training on different modalities, enable better multi-modal fusion. Combining the prompt engineering techniques for efficient training, we propose the Prompted Foundational 3D Detector (PF3Det), which integrates foundation model encoders and soft prompts to enhance LiDAR-camera feature fusion. PF3Det achieves the state-of-the-art results under limited training data, improving NDS by 1.19% and mAP by 2.42% on the nuScenes dataset, demonstrating its efficiency in 3D detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted to the CVPR 2025 Workshop on Distillation of Foundation Models for Autonomous Driving (WDFM-AD)</p></details> |

Owing to its sensing capabilities in all weather conditions, 4D radar has recently received much attention. However, compared to LiDAR, 4D radar provides much sparser point cloud. In this paper, we propose a 3D object detection method, termed ZFusion, which fuses 4D radar and vision modality. As the core of ZFusion, our proposed FP-DDCA (Feature Pyramid-Double Deformable Cross Attention) fuser complements the (sparse) radar information and (dense) vision information, effectively. Specifically, with a feature-pyramid structure, the FP-DDCA fuser packs Transformer blocks to interactively fuse multi-modal features at different scales, thus enhancing perception accuracy. In addition, we utilize the Depth-Context-Split view transformation module due to the physical properties of 4D radar. Considering that 4D radar has a much lower cost than LiDAR, ZFusion is an attractive alternative to LiDAR-based methods. In typical traffic scenarios like the VoD (View-of-Delft) dataset, experiments show that with reasonable inference speed, ZFusion achieved the state-of-the-art mAP (mean average precision) in the region of interest, while having competitive mAP in the entire area compared to the baseline methods, which demonstrates performance close to LiDAR and greatly outperforms those camera-only methods.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 WDFM-AD |
| **[Benchmarking Vision Foundation Models for Input Monitoring in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08083v3)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks (DNNs) remain challenged by distribution shifts in complex open-world domains like automated driving (AD): Robustness against yet unknown novel objects (semantic shift) or styles like lighting conditions (covariate shift) cannot be guaranteed. Hence, reliable operation-time monitors for identification of out-of-training-data-distribution (OOD) scenarios are imperative. Current approaches for OOD classification are untested for complex domains like AD, are limited in the kinds of shifts they detect, or even require supervision with OOD samples. To prepare for unanticipated shifts, we instead establish a framework around a principled, unsupervised and model-agnostic method that unifies detection of semantic and covariate shifts: Find a full model of the training data's feature distribution, to then use its density at new points as in-distribution (ID) score. To implement this, we propose to combine Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) as feature extractors with density modeling techniques. Through a comprehensive benchmark of 4 VFMs with different backbone architectures and 5 density-modeling techniques against established baselines, we provide the first systematic evaluation of OOD classification capabilities of VFMs across diverse conditions. A comparison with state-of-the-art binary OOD classification methods reveals that VFM embeddings with density estimation outperform existing approaches in identifying OOD inputs. Additionally, we show that our method detects high-risk inputs likely to cause errors in downstream tasks, thereby improving overall performance. Overall, VFMs, when coupled with robust density modeling techniques, are promising to realize model-agnostic, unsupervised, reliable safety monitors in complex vision tasks</p></details> |  |

However, their spatial understanding and reasoning-key capabilities for autonomous driving-still exhibit significant limitations. Notably, none of the existing benchmarks systematically evaluate VLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities in driving scenarios. To fill this gap, we propose NuScenes-SpatialQA, the first large-scale ground-truth-based Question-Answer (QA) benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the spatial understanding and reasoning capabilities of VLMs in autonomous driving. Built upon the NuScenes dataset, the benchmark is constructed through an automated 3D scene graph generation pipeline and a QA generation pipeline. The benchmark systematically evaluates VLMs' performance in both spatial understanding and reasoning across multiple dimensions. Using this benchmark, we conduct extensive experiments on diverse VLMs, including both general and spatial-enhanced models, providing the first comprehensive evaluation of their spatial capabilities in autonomous driving. Surprisingly, the experimental results show that the spatial-enhanced VLM outperforms in qualitative QA but does not demonstrate competitiveness in quantitative QA. In general, VLMs still face considerable challenges in spatial understanding and reasoning.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods relying on dense point clouds and triangular meshes struggle with moving objects, occlusions, and real-time processing constraints, limiting their effectiveness in complex urban environments. While multi-view stereo and neural radiance fields have advanced 3D reconstruction, they face challenges in computational efficiency and handling scene dynamics. This paper proposes a novel 3D Gaussian point distribution method for dynamic street scene reconstruction. Our approach introduces an adaptive transparency mechanism that eliminates moving objects while preserving high-fidelity static scene details. Additionally, iterative refinement of Gaussian point distribution enhances geometric accuracy and texture representation. We integrate directional encoding with spatial position optimization to optimize storage and rendering efficiency, reducing redundancy while maintaining scene integrity. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves high reconstruction quality, improved rendering performance, and adaptability in large-scale dynamic environments. These contributions establish a robust framework for real-time, high-precision 3D reconstruction, advancing the practicality of dynamic scene modeling across multiple applications.</p></details> |  |

This could revolutionize applications in robotics, autonomous driving, and scientific simulation. However, before treating these models as world models, we must ask: Do they adhere to physical conservation laws? To answer this, we introduce Morpheus, a benchmark for evaluating video generation models on physical reasoning. It features 80 real-world videos capturing physical phenomena, guided by conservation laws. Since artificial generations lack ground truth, we assess physical plausibility using physics-informed metrics evaluated with respect to infallible conservation laws known per physical setting, leveraging advances in physics-informed neural networks and vision-language foundation models. Our findings reveal that even with advanced prompting and video conditioning, current models struggle to encode physical principles despite generating aesthetically pleasing videos.

While research in model-based 6D object pose estimation has delivered promising results, model-free methods are hindered by the high computational load in rendering and inferring consistent poses of arbitrary objects in a live RGB-D video stream. To address this issue, we present 6DOPE-GS, a novel method for online 6D object pose estimation \& tracking with a single RGB-D camera by effectively leveraging advances in Gaussian Splatting. Thanks to the fast differentiable rendering capabilities of Gaussian Splatting, 6DOPE-GS can simultaneously optimize for 6D object poses and 3D object reconstruction. To achieve the necessary efficiency and accuracy for live tracking, our method uses incremental 2D Gaussian Splatting with an intelligent dynamic keyframe selection procedure to achieve high spatial object coverage and prevent erroneous pose updates. We also propose an opacity statistic-based pruning mechanism for adaptive Gaussian density control, to ensure training stability and efficiency. We evaluate our method on the HO3D and YCBInEOAT datasets and show that 6DOPE-GS matches the performance of state-of-the-art baselines for model-free simultaneous 6D pose tracking and reconstruction while providing a 5$\times$ speedup. We also demonstrate the method's suitability for live, dynamic object tracking and reconstruction in a real-world setting.</p></details> |  |

The model can reason about the behavior of other vehicles like a human driver and respond with different decision-making styles, thereby improving the intelligence and diversity of the surrounding vehicles in the driving scenario. By introducing the Level-k behavioral game theory, the paper models the decision-making process of human drivers and employs deep reinforcement learning to train the models with diverse decision styles, simulating different reasoning approaches and behavioral characteristics. Building on the Poisson cognitive hierarchy theory, this paper also presents a novel driving scenario generation method. The method controls the proportion of vehicles with different driving styles in the scenario using Poisson and binomial distributions, thus generating controllable and diverse driving environments. Experimental results demonstrate that CHARMS not only exhibits superior decision-making capabilities as ego vehicles, but also generates more complex and diverse driving scenarios as surrounding vehicles. We will release code for CHARMS at https://github.com/WUTAD-Wjy/CHARMS.</p></details> |  |

Many applications in AD systems necessitate high-quality training datasets using both existing datasets and newly collected data. In this paper, we propose a traffic scene joint active learning (TSceneJAL) framework that can efficiently sample the balanced, diverse, and complex traffic scenes from both labeled and unlabeled data. The novelty of this framework is threefold: 1) a scene sampling scheme based on a category entropy, to identify scenes containing multiple object classes, thus mitigating class imbalance for the active learner; 2) a similarity sampling scheme, estimated through the directed graph representation and a marginalize kernel algorithm, to pick sparse and diverse scenes; 3) an uncertainty sampling scheme, predicted by a mixture density network, to select instances with the most unclear or complex regression outcomes for the learner. Finally, the integration of these three schemes in a joint selection strategy yields an optimal and valuable subdataset. Experiments on the KITTI, Lyft, nuScenes and SUScape datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on 3D object detection tasks with up to 12% improvements.</p></details> |  |

Recent state-of-the-art models utilize projection-based methods which formulate BEV perception as query learning to bypass explicit depth estimation. While we observe promising advancements in this paradigm, they still fall short of real-world applications because of the lack of uncertainty modeling and expensive computational requirement. In this work, we introduce GaussianLSS, a novel uncertainty-aware BEV perception framework that revisits unprojection-based methods, specifically the Lift-Splat-Shoot (LSS) paradigm, and enhances them with depth un-certainty modeling. GaussianLSS represents spatial dispersion by learning a soft depth mean and computing the variance of the depth distribution, which implicitly captures object extents. We then transform the depth distribution into 3D Gaussians and rasterize them to construct uncertainty-aware BEV features. We evaluate GaussianLSS on the nuScenes dataset, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to unprojection-based methods. In particular, it provides significant advantages in speed, running 2.5x faster, and in memory efficiency, using 0.3x less memory compared to projection-based methods, while achieving competitive performance with only a 0.4% IoU difference.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR'25. https://hcis-lab.github.io/GaussianLSS/</p></details> |

To address this, we introduce MinkOcc, a multi-modal 3D semantic occupancy prediction framework for cameras and LiDARs that proposes a two-step semi-supervised training procedure. Here, a small dataset of explicitly 3D annotations warm-starts the training process; then, the supervision is continued by simpler-to-annotate accumulated LiDAR sweeps and images -- semantically labelled through vision foundational models. MinkOcc effectively utilizes these sensor-rich supervisory cues and reduces reliance on manual labeling by 90\% while maintaining competitive accuracy. In addition, the proposed model incorporates information from LiDAR and camera data through early fusion and leverages sparse convolution networks for real-time prediction. With its efficiency in both supervision and computation, we aim to extend MinkOcc beyond curated datasets, enabling broader real-world deployment of 3D semantic occupancy prediction in autonomous driving.</p></details> | 8 pages |

The unbounded complexity of the driving context, including unforeseeable events, necessitate continuous improvement, often achieved through iterative DevOps processes. However, DevOps processes are themselves complex, making these improvements both time- and resource-intensive. Automation in code generation for ADS using Large Language Models (LLM) is one potential approach to address this challenge. Nevertheless, the development of ADS requires rigorous processes to verify, validate, assess, and qualify the code before it can be deployed in the vehicle and used. In this study, we developed and evaluated a prototype for automatic code generation and assessment using a designed pipeline of a LLM-based agent, simulation model, and rule-based feedback generator in an industrial setup.

Yet, to fully realize its potential, an effective online trajectory evaluation is indispensable to ensure safety. By forecasting the future outcomes of a given trajectory, trajectory evaluation becomes much more effective. This goal can be achieved by employing a world model to capture environmental dynamics and predict future states. Therefore, we propose an end-to-end driving framework WoTE, which leverages a BEV World model to predict future BEV states for Trajectory Evaluation.

In this paper, we raise an intriguing question: can the combination of image restoration and object detection enhance detection performance in adverse weather conditions? To answer it, we propose an effective architecture that bridges image dehazing and object detection together via guidance information and task-driven learning to achieve detection-friendly dehazing, termed FriendNet. FriendNet aims to deliver both high-quality perception and high detection capacity. Different from existing efforts that intuitively treat image dehazing as pre-processing, FriendNet establishes a positive correlation between these two tasks. Clean features generated by the dehazing network potentially contribute to improvements in object detection performance. Conversely, object detection crucially guides the learning process of the image dehazing network under the task-driven learning scheme. We shed light on how downstream tasks can guide upstream dehazing processes, considering both network architecture and learning objectives. We design Guidance Fusion Block (GFB) and Guidance Attention Block (GAB) to facilitate the integration of detection information into the network. Furthermore, the incorporation of the detection task loss aids in refining the optimization process. Additionally, we introduce a new Physics-aware Feature Enhancement Block (PFEB), which integrates physics-based priors to enhance the feature extraction and representation capabilities. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art methods on both image quality and detection precision.

| **[Overlap-Aware Feature Learning for Robust Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for 3D Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01668v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D point cloud semantic segmentation (PCSS) is a cornerstone for environmental perception in robotic systems and autonomous driving, enabling precise scene understanding through point-wise classification. While unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) mitigates label scarcity in PCSS, existing methods critically overlook the inherent vulnerability to real-world perturbations (e.g., snow, fog, rain) and adversarial distortions. This work first identifies two intrinsic limitations that undermine current PCSS-UDA robustness: (a) unsupervised features overlap from unaligned boundaries in shared-class regions and (b) feature structure erosion caused by domain-invariant learning that suppresses target-specific patterns. To address the proposed problems, we propose a tripartite framework consisting of: 1) a robustness evaluation model quantifying resilience against adversarial attack/corruption types through robustness metrics; 2) an invertible attention alignment module (IAAM) enabling bidirectional domain mapping while preserving discriminative structure via attention-guided overlap suppression; and 3) a contrastive memory bank with quality-aware contrastive learning that progressively refines pseudo-labels with feature quality for more discriminative representations. Extensive experiments on SynLiDAR-to-SemanticPOSS adaptation demonstrate a maximum mIoU improvement of 14.3\% under adversarial attack.</p></details> | 8 pages,6 figures |

Since even minor environmental changes can significantly degrade system performance, and conducting long-term posterior experimental evaluations in all scenarios is often infeasible, it is crucial to perform a priori performance assessments to design robust and reliable systems. In this paper, we consider a discrete ubiquitous sensing system where the sensing target has \(m\) different states \(W\), which can be characterized by \(n\)-dimensional independent features \(X^n\). This model not only provides the possibility of optimizing the sensing systems at a finer granularity and balancing communication and sensing resources, but also provides theoretical explanations for classical intuitive feelings (like more modalities and more accuracy) in wireless sensing. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed channel model through real-case studies, including person identification, displacement detection, direction estimation, and device recognition. The evaluation results indicate a Pearson correlation coefficient exceeding 0.9 between our task mutual information and conventional experimental metrics (e.g., accuracy).

Previous end-to-end autonomous driving works represent both types of information in a single feature vector. However, including motion related tasks, such as prediction and planning, impairs detection and tracking performance, a phenomenon known as negative transfer in multi-task learning. To address this issue, we propose Neural-Bayes motion decoding, a novel parallel detection, tracking, and prediction method that separates semantic and motion learning. Specifically, we employ a set of learned motion queries that operate in parallel with detection and tracking queries, sharing a unified set of recursively updated reference points. Moreover, we employ interactive semantic decoding to enhance information exchange in semantic tasks, promoting positive transfer. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset with UniAD and SparseDrive confirm the effectiveness of our divide and merge approach, resulting in performance improvements across perception, prediction, and planning.

Most existing closed-loop simulators rely on rule-based controls for other vehicles, which results in a lack of diversity and randomness, thus failing to accurately assess the motion planning capabilities in highly interactive scenarios. Moreover, traditional evaluation metrics are insufficient for comprehensively evaluating the performance of merging in dense traffic. In response, we proposed a closed-loop evaluation benchmark for assessing motion planning capabilities in merging scenarios. Our approach involves other vehicles trained in large scale datasets with micro-behavioral characteristics that significantly enhance the complexity and diversity. Additionally, we have restructured the evaluation mechanism by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to assess each autonomous vehicle merging onto the main lane. Extensive experiments and test-vehicle deployment have demonstrated the progressiveness of this benchmark. Through this benchmark, we have obtained an evaluation of existing methods and identified common issues.

Traditional local differential privacy methods, designed for scalars and matrices, are insufficient for tensors, as they fail to preserve essential relationships among tensor elements. We introduce TLDP, a novel LDP algorithm for Tensors, which employs a randomized response mechanism to perturb tensor components while maintaining structural integrity. To strike a better balance between utility and privacy, we incorporate a weight matrix that selectively protects sensitive regions. Both theoretical analysis and empirical findings from real-world datasets show that TLDP achieves superior utility while preserving privacy, making it a robust solution for high-dimensional tensor data.</p></details> |  |

This study introduces Deep LG-Track, a novel multi-object tracker that incorporates three key enhancements to improve the tracking accuracy and robustness. First, an adaptive Kalman filter is developed to dynamically update the covariance of measurement noise based on detection confidence and trajectory disappearance. Second, a novel cost matrix is formulated to adaptively fuse motion and appearance information, leveraging localization confidence and detection confidence as weighting factors. Third, a dynamic appearance feature updating strategy is introduced, adjusting the relative weighting of historical and current appearance features based on appearance clarity and localization accuracy.

In applications like autonomous driving, online targetless calibration enables a prompt sensor misalignment correction from mechanical vibrations without extra targets. However, existing methods exhibit limitations in effectively extracting consistent features from LiDAR and camera data and fail to prioritize salient regions, compromising cross-modal alignment robustness. To address these issues, we propose DF-Calib, a LiDAR-camera calibration method that reformulates calibration as an intra-modality depth flow estimation problem. DF-Calib estimates a dense depth map from the camera image and completes the sparse LiDAR projected depth map, using a shared feature encoder to extract consistent depth-to-depth features, effectively bridging the 2D-3D cross-modal gap. Additionally, we introduce a reliability map to prioritize valid pixels and propose a perceptually weighted sparse flow loss to enhance depth flow estimation. Experimental results across multiple datasets validate its accuracy and generalization,with DF-Calib achieving a mean translation error of 0.635cm and rotation error of 0.045 degrees on the KITTI dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages,3 figures, 3 figures</p></details> |

The aim of our research is to investigate how AVs can navigate crowded, unpredictable scenarios with multiple pedestrians while maintaining a safe and efficient vehicle behavior. So far, most research has concentrated on static or deterministic traffic participant behavior. This paper introduces a novel algorithm for motion planning in crowded spaces by combining social force principles for simulating realistic pedestrian behavior with a risk-aware motion planner. We evaluate this new algorithm in a 2D simulation environment to rigorously assess AV-pedestrian interactions, demonstrating that our algorithm enables safe, efficient, and adaptive motion planning, particularly in highly crowded urban environments - a first in achieving this level of performance. This study has not taken into consideration real-time constraints and has been shown only in simulation so far. Further studies are needed to investigate the novel algorithm in a complete software stack for AVs on real cars to investigate the entire perception, planning and control pipeline in crowded scenarios. We release the code developed in this research as an open-source resource for further studies and development.

This research builds upon and extends existing approaches in risk-aware motion planning and occlusion tracking to address these challenges. While prior studies have developed individual methods for occlusion tracking and risk assessment, a comprehensive method integrating these techniques has not been fully explored. We, therefore, enhance a phantom agent-centric model by incorporating sequential reasoning to track occluded areas and predict potential hazards. Our model enables realistic scenario representation and context-aware risk evaluation by modeling diverse phantom agents, each with distinct behavior profiles. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed approach improves situational awareness and balances proactive safety with efficient traffic flow. While these results underline the potential of our method, validation in real-world scenarios is necessary to confirm its feasibility and generalizability. By utilizing and advancing established methodologies, this work contributes to safer and more reliable AV planning in complex urban environments.

To address this problem, cooperative perception methods via vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication have been proposed, but they have tended to focus on perception tasks like detection or tracking. How those approaches contribute to overall cooperative planning performance is still under-explored. Inspired by recent progress using Large Language Models (LLMs) to build autonomous driving systems, we propose a novel problem setting that integrates a Multi-Modal LLM into cooperative autonomous driving, with the proposed Vehicle-to-Vehicle Question-Answering (V2V-QA) dataset and benchmark. We also propose our baseline method Vehicle-to-Vehicle Multi-Modal Large Language Model (V2V-LLM), which uses an LLM to fuse perception information from multiple connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) and answer various types of driving-related questions: grounding, notable object identification, and planning. Experimental results show that our proposed V2V-LLM can be a promising unified model architecture for performing various tasks in cooperative autonomous driving, and outperforms other baseline methods that use different fusion approaches. Our work also creates a new research direction that can improve the safety of future autonomous driving systems.

Collaborative autonomous driving (CAV) seems like a promising direction, but collecting data for development is non-trivial. It requires placing multiple sensor-equipped agents in a real-world driving scene, simultaneously! As such, existing datasets are limited in locations and agents. We introduce a novel surrogate to the rescue, which is to generate realistic perception from different viewpoints in a driving scene, conditioned on a real-world sample - the ego-car's sensory data. This surrogate has huge potential: it could potentially turn any ego-car dataset into a collaborative driving one to scale up the development of CAV. We present the very first solution, using a combination of simulated collaborative data and real ego-car data. Our method, Transfer Your Perspective (TYP), learns a conditioned diffusion model whose output samples are not only realistic but also consistent in both semantics and layouts with the given ego-car data. Empirical results demonstrate TYP's effectiveness in aiding in a CAV setting. In particular, TYP enables us to (pre-)train collaborative perception algorithms like early and late fusion with little or no real-world collaborative data, greatly facilitating downstream CAV applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |

To unlock these challenges, we present a structured roadmap for integrating FMs into autonomous driving, covering three key aspects: the infrastructure of FMs, their application in autonomous driving systems, and their current applications in practice. For each aspect, we review the current research progress, identify existing challenges, and highlight research gaps that need to be addressed by the community.</p></details> |  |

Novel view synthesis using neural radiance fields (NeRFs) has recently received considerable attention in AD due to its potential to enable efficient testing and validation but remains unexplored for radar point clouds. In this paper, we present NeuRadar, a NeRF-based model that jointly generates radar point clouds, camera images, and lidar point clouds. We explore set-based object detection methods such as DETR, and propose an encoder-based solution grounded in the NeRF geometry for improved generalizability. We propose both a deterministic and a probabilistic point cloud representation to accurately model the radar behavior, with the latter being able to capture radar's stochastic behavior. We achieve realistic reconstruction results for two automotive datasets, establishing a baseline for NeRF-based radar point cloud simulation models. In addition, we release radar data for ZOD's Sequences and Drives to enable further research in this field.

Existing prediction algorithms focus on extracting more detailed scene features or selecting more reasonable trajectory destinations. However, in the face of dynamic and evolving future movements of the target vehicle, these algorithms cannot provide a fine-grained and continuous description of future behaviors and lane constraints, which degrades the prediction accuracy. To address this challenge, we present BLNet, a novel dualstream architecture that synergistically integrates behavioral intention recognition and lane constraint modeling through parallel attention mechanisms. The framework generates fine-grained behavior state queries (capturing spatial-temporal movement patterns) and lane queries (encoding lane topology constraints), supervised by two auxiliary losses, respectively. Subsequently, a two-stage decoder first produces trajectory proposals, then performs point-level refinement by jointly incorporating both the continuity of passed lanes and future motion features. Extensive experiments on two large datasets, nuScenes and Argoverse, show that our network exhibits significant performance gains over existing direct regression and goal-based algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

However, existing methods fail to perform instance-aware decomposition without manual annotations, which is crucial for instance-level scene editing.We propose UnIRe, a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) based approach that decomposes a scene into a static background and individual dynamic instances using only RGB images and LiDAR point clouds. At its core, we introduce 4D superpoints, a novel representation that clusters multi-frame LiDAR points in 4D space, enabling unsupervised instance separation based on spatiotemporal correlations. These 4D superpoints serve as the foundation for our decomposed 4D initialization, i.e., providing spatial and temporal initialization to train a dynamic 3DGS for arbitrary dynamic classes without requiring bounding boxes or object templates.Furthermore, we introduce a smoothness regularization strategy in both 2D and 3D space, further improving the temporal stability.Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms existing methods in decomposed dynamic scene reconstruction while enabling accurate and flexible instance-level editing, making it a practical solution for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

This field relies on accurate perception, understanding, and reconstruction of 3D scenes from 2D images or text data sources. Diffusion models, originally designed for 2D generative tasks, offer the potential for more flexible, probabilistic methods that can better capture the variability and uncertainty present in real-world 3D data. In this paper, we review the state-of-the-art methods that use diffusion models for 3D visual tasks, including but not limited to 3D object generation, shape completion, point-cloud reconstruction, and scene construction. We provide an in-depth discussion of the underlying mathematical principles of diffusion models, outlining their forward and reverse processes, as well as the various architectural advancements that enable these models to work with 3D datasets.

However, LiDAR point clouds may appear to have sparsity, uneven distribution, and incomplete structures, significantly limiting the detection performance. In road driving environments, target objects referring to vehicles, pedestrians and cyclists are well-suited for enhancing representation through the complete template guidance, considering their grid and topological structures. Therefore, this paper presents an intrinsic-feature-guided 3D object detection method based on a template-assisted feature enhancement module, which extracts intrinsic features from relatively generalized templates and provides rich structural information for foreground objects. Furthermore, a proposal-level contrastive learning mechanism is designed to enhance the feature differences between foreground and background objects. The proposed modules can act as plug-and-play components and improve the performance of multiple existing methods.

Prior works typically express spatial information through textual representations of coordinates, resulting in semantic gaps between visual coordinate representations and textual descriptions. This oversight hinders the accurate transmission of spatial information and increases the expressive burden. To address this, we propose a novel Marker-based Prompt learning framework (MPDrive), which represents spatial coordinates by concise visual markers, ensuring linguistic expressive consistency and enhancing the accuracy of both visual perception and spatial expression in AD-VQA. Specifically, we create marker images by employing a detection expert to overlay object regions with numerical labels, converting complex textual coordinate generation into straightforward text-based visual marker predictions. Moreover, we fuse original and marker images as scene-level features and integrate them with detection priors to derive instance-level features. By combining these features, we construct dual-granularity visual prompts that stimulate the LLM's spatial perception capabilities. Extensive experiments on the DriveLM and CODA-LM datasets show that MPDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in cases requiring sophisticated spatial understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

We present a novel semantic SLAM approach that leverages road elements such as lane boundaries, traffic signs, and road markings to enhance localization accuracy. Our system integrates real-time semantic feature detection with a graph optimization framework, effectively handling both rolling-shutter effects and INS drift. Using a practical hardware setup which consists of a rolling-shutter camera (3840*2160@30fps), IMU (100Hz), and wheel encoder (50Hz), we demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods.

In this work, we introduce SWIFT, a test-time scaling framework tailored for WFMs. SWIFT integrates our extensible WFM evaluation toolkit with process-level inference strategies, including fast tokenization, probability-based Top-K pruning, and efficient beam search. Empirical results on the COSMOS model demonstrate that test-time scaling exists even in a compute-optimal way. Our findings reveal that test-time scaling laws hold for WFMs and that SWIFT provides a scalable and effective pathway for improving WFM inference without retraining or increasing model size.

Existing methodologies typically adopt two paradigms: decision then planning or generation then scoring. However, the former architecture often suffers from decision-planning misalignment that incurs risky situations. Meanwhile, the latter struggles to balance short-term operational metrics (e.g., immediate motion smoothness) with long-term tactical goals (e.g., route efficiency), resulting in myopic or overly conservative behaviors. To address these issues, we introduce CALMM-Drive, a novel Confidence-Aware Large Multimodal Model (LMM) empowered Autonomous Driving framework. Our approach integrates driving task-oriented Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning coupled with Top-K confidence elicitation, which facilitates high-level reasoning to generate multiple candidate decisions with their confidence levels. Furthermore, we propose a novel planning module that integrates a diffusion model for trajectory generation and a hierarchical refinement process to find the optimal trajectory. This framework enables the selection over trajectory candidates accounting for both low-level solution quality and high-level tactical confidence, which avoids the risks within one-shot decisions and overcomes the limitations in short-sighted scoring mechanisms. Comprehensive evaluations in nuPlan closed-loop simulation environments demonstrate the competitive performance of CALMM-Drive across both common and long-tail benchmarks, showcasing a significant advancement in the integration of uncertainty in LMM-empowered AVs. The code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures |

However, adverse environments, such as rain, snow, and fog, can significantly degrade the performance of LiDAR and cameras. In contrast, 4D millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar not only provides 3D sensing and additional velocity measurements but also maintains robustness in challenging conditions, making it increasingly valuable for autonomous driving. Recently, research on 4D mmWave radar under adverse environments has been growing, but a comprehensive survey is still lacking. To bridge this gap, this survey comprehensively reviews the current research on 4D mmWave radar under adverse environments. First, we present an overview of existing 4D mmWave radar datasets encompassing diverse weather and lighting scenarios. Next, we analyze methods and models according to different adverse conditions. Finally, the challenges faced in current studies and potential future directions are discussed for advancing 4D mmWave radar applications in harsh environments.

Class Activation Mapping (CAM) techniques have emerged as a key approach to visualizing model decisions, yet existing methods face inherent trade-offs. Gradient-based CAM variants suffer from sensitivity to gradient perturbations, leading to unstable and unreliable explanations. Conversely, gradient-free approaches mitigate gradient instability but incur significant computational overhead and inference latency. To address these limitations, we propose Cluster Filter Class Activation Map (CF-CAM), a novel framework that reintroduces gradient-based weighting while enhancing robustness against gradient noise. CF-CAM employs a hierarchical importance weighting strategy to balance discriminative feature preservation and noise elimination. A density-aware channel clustering via Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) groups semantically relevant feature channels and discard noise-prone activations. Additionally, cluster-conditioned gradient filtering leverages bilateral filters to refine gradient signals, preserving edge-aware localization while suppressing noise impact. Experiment results demonstrate that CF-CAM achieves superior interpretability performance while maintaining resilience to gradient perturbations, outperforming state-of-the-art CAM methods in faithfulness and robustness. By effectively mitigating gradient instability without excessive computational cost, CF-CAM provides a reliable solution for enhancing the interpretability of deep neural networks in critical applications such as medical diagnosis and autonomous driving.</p></details> |  |

Most existing methods employ a spatial propagation network to iteratively refine the depth map after obtaining an initial dense depth. In this paper, we propose DenseFormer, a novel method that integrates the diffusion model into the depth completion task. By incorporating the denoising mechanism of the diffusion model, DenseFormer generates the dense depth map by progressively refining an initial random depth distribution through multiple iterations. We propose a feature extraction module that leverages a feature pyramid structure, along with multi-layer deformable attention, to effectively extract and integrate features from sparse depth maps and RGB images, which serve as the guiding condition for the diffusion process. Additionally, this paper presents a depth refinement module that applies multi-step iterative refinement across various ranges to the dense depth results generated by the diffusion process. The module utilizes image features enriched with multi-scale information and sparse depth input to further enhance the accuracy of the predicted depth map. Extensive experiments on the KITTI outdoor scene dataset demonstrate that DenseFormer outperforms classical depth completion methods.</p></details> |  |

While existing approaches rely on single-frame analysis from onboard cameras, they struggle with complex scenarios involving occlusions and adverse lighting conditions. We present \textit{ViTLR}, a novel video-based end-to-end neural network that processes multiple consecutive frames to achieve robust traffic light detection and state classification.

Information from roadside cameras can greatly expand the map perception range through vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications. However, there is still no dataset from the real world available for the study on map vectorization onboard under the scenario of vehicle-infrastructure cooperation. To prosper the research on online HD mapping for Vehicle-Infrastructure Cooperative Autonomous Driving (VICAD), we release a real-world dataset, which contains collaborative camera frames from both vehicles and roadside infrastructures, and provides human annotations of HD map elements. We also present an end-to-end neural framework (i.e., V2I-HD) leveraging vision-centric V2I systems to construct vectorized maps. To reduce computation costs and further deploy V2I-HD on autonomous vehicles, we introduce a directionally decoupled self-attention mechanism to V2I-HD. Extensive experiments show that V2I-HD has superior performance in real-time inference speed, as tested by our real-world dataset. Abundant qualitative results also demonstrate stable and robust map construction quality with low cost in complex and various driving scenes.

Considering the extensive variation in lane structures worldwide, achieving high generalization capacity is particularly challenging, as algorithms must accurately identify a wide variety of lane patterns worldwide. Traditional top-down approaches rely heavily on learning lane characteristics from training datasets, often struggling with lanes exhibiting previously unseen attributes. To address this generalization limitation, we propose a method that detects keypoints of lanes and subsequently predicts sequential connections between them to construct complete 3D lanes. Each key point is essential for maintaining lane continuity, and we predict multiple proposals per keypoint by allowing adjacent grids to predict the same keypoint using an offset mechanism. PointNMS is employed to eliminate overlapping proposal keypoints, reducing redundancy in the estimated BEV graph and minimizing computational overhead from connection estimations. Our model surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods on both the Apollo and OpenLane datasets, demonstrating superior F1 scores and a strong generalization capacity when models trained on OpenLane are evaluated on the Apollo dataset, compared to prior approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |

Although sensor fusion architectures enhance performance in challenging environments, they still suffer significant performance drops under severe sensor failures, such as LiDAR beam reduction, LiDAR drop, limited field of view, camera drop, and occlusion. This limitation stems from inter-modality dependencies in current sensor fusion frameworks. In this study, we introduce an efficient and robust LiDAR-camera 3D object detector, referred to as MoME, which can achieve robust performance through a mixture of experts approach. Our MoME fully decouples modality dependencies using three parallel expert decoders, which use camera features, LiDAR features, or a combination of both to decode object queries, respectively. We propose Multi-Expert Decoding (MED) framework, where each query is decoded selectively using one of three expert decoders. MoME utilizes an Adaptive Query Router (AQR) to select the most appropriate expert decoder for each query based on the quality of camera and LiDAR features. This ensures that each query is processed by the best-suited expert, resulting in robust performance across diverse sensor failure scenarios. We evaluated the performance of MoME on the nuScenes-R benchmark. Our MoME achieved state-of-the-art performance in extreme weather and sensor failure conditions, significantly outperforming the existing models across various sensor failure scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Cal or No Cal? -- Real-Time Miscalibration Detection of LiDAR and Camera Sensors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01040v1)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The goal of extrinsic calibration is the alignment of sensor data to ensure an accurate representation of the surroundings and enable sensor fusion applications. From a safety perspective, sensor calibration is a key enabler of autonomous driving. In the current state of the art, a trend from target-based offline calibration towards targetless online calibration can be observed. However, online calibration is subject to strict real-time and resource constraints which are not met by state-of-the-art methods. This is mainly due to the high number of parameters to estimate, the reliance on geometric features, or the dependence on specific vehicle maneuvers. To meet these requirements and ensure the vehicle's safety at any time, we propose a miscalibration detection framework that shifts the focus from the direct regression of calibration parameters to a binary classification of the calibration state, i.e., calibrated or miscalibrated. Therefore, we propose a contrastive learning approach that compares embedded features in a latent space to classify the calibration state of two different sensor modalities. Moreover, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the feature embeddings and challenging calibration errors that highlight the performance of our approach. As a result, our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art in terms of detection performance, inference time, and resource demand. The code is open source and available on https://github.com/TUMFTM/MiscalibrationDetection.</p></details> |  |

A world model is a neural network capable of predicting an agent's next state given past states and actions. By leveraging a world model during training, the driving policy effectively mitigates covariate shift without requiring an excessive amount of training data. During end-to-end training, our policy learns how to recover from errors by aligning with states observed in human demonstrations, so that at runtime it can recover from perturbations outside the training distribution. Additionally, we introduce a novel transformer-based perception encoder that employs multi-view cross-attention and a learned scene query.

While MLLMs have been extensively studied for visual semantic understanding tasks, their ability to perform precise and quantitative spatial-temporal understanding in real-world applications remains largely unexamined, leading to uncertain prospects. To evaluate models' Spatial-Temporal Intelligence, we introduce STI-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' spatial-temporal understanding through challenging tasks such as estimating and predicting the appearance, pose, displacement, and motion of objects. Our benchmark encompasses a wide range of robot and vehicle operations across desktop, indoor, and outdoor scenarios. The extensive experiments reveals that the state-of-the-art MLLMs still struggle in real-world spatial-temporal understanding, especially in tasks requiring precise distance estimation and motion analysis.</p></details> |  |

However, the safety and robustness assessment of autonomous driving has not received sufficient attention. Current evaluations of autonomous driving are typically conducted in natural driving scenarios. However, many accidents often occur in edge cases, also known as safety-critical scenarios. These safety-critical scenarios are difficult to collect, and there is currently no clear definition of what constitutes a safety-critical scenario. In this work, we explore the safety and robustness of autonomous driving in safety-critical scenarios. First, we provide a definition of safety-critical scenarios, including static traffic scenarios such as adversarial attack scenarios and natural distribution shifts, as well as dynamic traffic scenarios such as accident scenarios. Then, we develop an autonomous driving safety testing platform to comprehensively evaluate autonomous driving systems, encompassing not only the assessment of perception modules but also system-level evaluations. Our work systematically constructs a safety verification process for autonomous driving, providing technical support for the industry to establish standardized test framework and reduce risks in real-world road deployment.</p></details> |  |

This survey provides a comprehensive review of RL-based MoP for AD, focusing on lessons from task-specific perspectives. We first outline the fundamentals of RL methodologies, and then survey their applications in MoP, analyzing scenario-specific features and task requirements to shed light on their influence on RL design choices. Building on this analysis, we summarize key design experiences, extract insights from various driving task applications, and provide guidance for future implementations.

However, the progress of using language prompts in driving scenarios is stuck in a bottleneck due to the scarcity of paired prompt-instance data. To address this challenge, we propose the first object-centric language prompt set for driving scenes within 3D, multi-view, and multi-frame space, named NuPrompt. It expands nuScenes dataset by constructing a total of 40,147 language descriptions, each referring to an average of 7.4 object tracklets. Based on the object-text pairs from the new benchmark, we formulate a novel prompt-based driving task, \ie, employing a language prompt to predict the described object trajectory across views and frames. Furthermore, we provide a simple end-to-end baseline model based on Transformer, named PromptTrack. Experiments show that our PromptTrack achieves impressive performance on NuPrompt.

OpenDriveVLA builds upon open-source pre-trained large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to generate reliable driving actions, conditioned on 3D environmental perception, ego vehicle states, and driver commands. To bridge the modality gap between driving visual representations and language embeddings, we propose a hierarchical vision-language alignment process, projecting both 2D and 3D structured visual tokens into a unified semantic space. Besides, OpenDriveVLA models the dynamic relationships between the ego vehicle, surrounding agents, and static road elements through an autoregressive agent-env-ego interaction process, ensuring both spatially and behaviorally informed trajectory planning. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that OpenDriveVLA achieves state-of-the-art results across open-loop trajectory planning and driving-related question-answering tasks. Qualitative analyses further illustrate OpenDriveVLA's superior capability to follow high-level driving commands and robustly generate trajectories under challenging scenarios, highlighting its potential for next-generation end-to-end autonomous driving.

To overcome the localization risks caused by dynamic landmarks in most VI-SLAM systems, a robust visual-inertial motion prior SLAM system, named (IDY-VINS), is proposed in this paper which effectively handles dynamic landmarks using inertial motion prior for dynamic environments to varying degrees. Specifically, potential dynamic landmarks are preprocessed during the feature tracking phase by the probabilistic model of landmarks' minimum projection errors which are obtained from inertial motion prior and epipolar constraint. Subsequently, a bundle adjustment (BA) residual is proposed considering the minimum projection error prior for dynamic candidate landmarks. This residual is integrated into a sliding window based nonlinear optimization process to estimate camera poses, IMU states and landmark positions while minimizing the impact of dynamic candidate landmarks that deviate from the motion prior. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that our proposed system outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of localization accuracy and time cost by robustly mitigating the influence of dynamic landmarks.</p></details> |  |

However, existing datasets fall short in capturing the diversity and dynamics of VRU behaviors, making it difficult to meet the research demands of complex traffic environments. To address this gap, this study developed the OnSiteVRU datasets, which cover a variety of scenarios, including intersections, road segments, and urban villages. These datasets provide trajectory data for motor vehicles, electric bicycles, and human-powered bicycles, totaling approximately 17,429 trajectories with a precision of 0.04 seconds. The datasets integrate both aerial-view natural driving data and onboard real-time dynamic detection data, along with environmental information such as traffic signals, obstacles, and real-time maps, enabling a comprehensive reconstruction of interaction events. The results demonstrate that VRU\_Data outperforms traditional datasets in terms of VRU density and scene coverage, offering a more comprehensive representation of VRU behavioral characteristics.

A commonly used two-stage strategy involves global retrieval followed by re-ranking using patch-level descriptors. Most deep learning-based methods in an end-to-end manner cannot extract global features with sufficient semantic information from RGB images. In contrast, re-ranking can utilize more explicit structural and semantic information in one-to-one matching process, but it is time-consuming. To bridge the gap between global retrieval and re-ranking and achieve a good trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, we propose StructVPR++, a framework that embeds structural and semantic knowledge into RGB global representations via segmentation-guided distillation. Our key innovation lies in decoupling label-specific features from global descriptors, enabling explicit semantic alignment between image pairs without requiring segmentation during deployment. Furthermore, we introduce a sample-wise weighted distillation strategy that prioritizes reliable training pairs while suppressing noisy ones. Experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that StructVPR++ surpasses state-of-the-art global methods by 5-23% in Recall@1 and even outperforms many two-stage approaches, achieving real-time efficiency with a single RGB input.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by T-PAMI2025</p></details> |

Due to the scarcity and diversity of extreme scenario datasets, current autonomous driving models struggle to effectively manage corner cases. This limitation poses a significant safety risk, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), autonomous vehicle systems have been involved in hundreds of reported crashes annually in the United States, occurred in corner cases like sun glare and fog, which caused a few fatal accident. Furthermore, in order to consistently maintain a robust and reliable autonomous driving system, it is essential for models not only to perform well on routine scenarios but also to adapt to newly emerging scenarios, especially those corner cases that deviate from the norm. This requires a learning mechanism that incrementally integrates new knowledge without degrading previously acquired capabilities. However, to the best of our knowledge, no existing continual learning methods have been proposed to ensure consistent and scalable corner case learning in autonomous driving. To address these limitations, we propose VLM-C4L, a continual learning framework that introduces Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to dynamically optimize and enhance corner case datasets, and VLM-C4L combines VLM-guided high-quality data extraction with a core data replay strategy, enabling the model to incrementally learn from diverse corner cases while preserving performance on previously routine scenarios, thus ensuring long-term stability and adaptability in real-world autonomous driving. We evaluate VLM-C4L on large-scale real-world autonomous driving datasets, including Waymo and the corner case dataset CODA.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the complexities of an MG problem, seeking (Markov perfect) Nash equilibrium (NE) is often very challenging for a general-sum MG. Markov potential games (MPGs), which are a special class of MGs, have appealing properties such as guaranteed existence of pure NEs and guaranteed convergence of gradient play algorithms, thereby leading to desirable properties for many MARL algorithms in their NE-seeking processes. However, the question of how to construct MPGs has been open. This paper provides sufficient conditions on the reward design and on the Markov decision process (MDP), under which an MG is an MPG. Numerical results on autonomous driving applications are reported.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, despite impressive results shown by the mass literature, developers often find it hard to ensure the safe deployment of these learning-based perception models. Attributing the challenge to the lack of safety-oriented metrics, we hereby present uncompromising spatial constraints (USC), which characterize a simple yet important localization requirement demanding the predictions to fully cover the objects when seen from the autonomous vehicle. The constraints, as we formulate using the perspective and bird's-eye views, can be naturally reflected by quantitative measures, such that having an object detector with a higher score implies a lower risk of collision. Finally, beyond model evaluation, we incorporate the quantitative measures into common loss functions to enable safety-oriented fine-tuning for existing models. With experiments using the nuScenes dataset and a closed-loop simulation, our work demonstrates such considerations of safety notions at the perception level not only improve model performances beyond accuracy but also allow for a more direct linkage to actual system safety.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ITSC 2024, 8 pages (IEEE double column format), 7 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

While existing methods have made significant progress, they often overlook explicit safety constraints and struggle to capture the complex interactions among traffic agents, environmental factors, and motion dynamics. To address these challenges, we present SafeCast, a risk-responsive motion forecasting model that integrates safety-aware decision-making with uncertainty-aware adaptability. SafeCast is the first to incorporate the Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) framework into motion forecasting, encoding interpretable safety rules--such as safe distances and collision avoidance--based on traffic norms and physical principles. To further enhance robustness, we introduce the Graph Uncertainty Feature (GUF), a graph-based module that injects learnable noise into Graph Attention Networks, capturing real-world uncertainties and enhancing generalization across diverse scenarios. We evaluate SafeCast on four real-world benchmark datasets--Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM), Highway Drone (HighD), ApolloScape, and the Macao Connected Autonomous Driving (MoCAD)--covering highway, urban, and mixed-autonomy traffic environments. Our model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy while maintaining a lightweight architecture and low inference latency, underscoring its potential for real-time deployment in safety-critical AD systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hybrid Action Based Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Objective Compatible Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08096v2)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown excellent performance in solving decision-making and control problems of autonomous driving, which is increasingly applied in diverse driving scenarios. However, driving is a multi-attribute problem, leading to challenges in achieving multi-objective compatibility for current RL methods, especially in both policy execution and policy iteration. On the one hand, the common action space structure with single action type limits driving flexibility or results in large behavior fluctuations during policy execution. On the other hand, the multi-attribute weighted single reward function result in the agent's disproportionate attention to certain objectives during policy iterations. To this end, we propose a Multi-objective Ensemble-Critic reinforcement learning method with Hybrid Parametrized Action for multi-objective compatible autonomous driving. Specifically, a parameterized action space is constructed to generate hybrid driving actions, combining both abstract guidance and concrete control commands. A multi-objective critics architecture is constructed considering multiple attribute rewards, to ensure simultaneously focusing on different driving objectives. Additionally, uncertainty-based exploration strategy is introduced to help the agent faster approach viable driving policy. The experimental results in both the simulated traffic environment and the HighD dataset demonstrate that our method can achieve multi-objective compatible autonomous driving in terms of driving efficiency, action consistency, and safety. It enhances the general performance of the driving while significantly increasing training efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 9 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

While this is a well-established problem, prior work has mostly explored naive solutions such as fine-tuning, focusing on the motion prediction task. In this work, we explore novel adaptation strategies for differentiable autonomy stacks consisting of prediction, planning, and control, perform evaluation in closed-loop, and investigate the often-overlooked issue of catastrophic forgetting. Specifically, we introduce two simple yet effective techniques: a low-rank residual decoder (LoRD) and multi-task fine-tuning. Through experiments across three models conducted on two real-world autonomous driving datasets (nuPlan, exiD), we demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods and highlight a significant performance gap between open-loop and closed-loop evaluation in prior approaches. Our approach improves forgetting by up to 23.33% and the closed-loop OOD driving score by 9.93% in comparison to standard fine-tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE International Conference on Robotics & Automation, ICRA 2025</p></details> |

However, effectively managing uncertainty - arising from noise, insufficient evidence, or conflicts between modalities - is crucial for reliable decision-making. Current uncertainty-aware machine learning methods leveraging, for example, evidence averaging, or evidence accumulation underestimate uncertainties in high-conflict scenarios. Moreover, the state-of-the-art evidence averaging strategy is not order invariant and fails to scale to multiple modalities. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multimodal learning method with order-invariant evidence fusion and introduce a conflict-based discounting mechanism that reallocates uncertain mass when unreliable modalities are detected. We provide both theoretical analysis and experimental validation, demonstrating that unlike the previous work, the proposed approach effectively distinguishes between conflicting and non-conflicting samples based on the provided uncertainty estimates, and outperforms the previous models in uncertainty-based conflict detection.</p></details> |  |

However, existing datasets and methods suffer from coarse-grained language instructions, and inadequate integration of 3D geometric reasoning with linguistic comprehension. To this end, we introduce NuGrounding, the first large-scale benchmark for multi-view 3D visual grounding in autonomous driving. We present a Hierarchy of Grounding (HoG) method to construct NuGrounding to generate hierarchical multi-level instructions, ensuring comprehensive coverage of human instruction patterns. To tackle this challenging dataset, we propose a novel paradigm that seamlessly combines instruction comprehension abilities of multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs) with precise localization abilities of specialist detection models. Our approach introduces two decoupled task tokens and a context query to aggregate 3D geometric information and semantic instructions, followed by a fusion decoder to refine spatial-semantic feature fusion for precise localization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the baselines adapted from representative 3D scene understanding methods by a significant margin and achieves 0.59 in precision and 0.64 in recall, with improvements of 50.8% and 54.7%.</p></details> |  |

However, in real-world applications such as autonomous driving, points rarely move independently of others, especially for nearby points belonging to the same object, which often share the same motion. Incorporating this locally rigid motion constraint has been a key challenge in self-supervised scene flow estimation, which is often addressed by post-processing or appending extra regularization. While these approaches are able to improve the rigidity of predicted flows, they lack an architectural inductive bias for local rigidity within the model structure, leading to suboptimal learning efficiency and inferior performance. In contrast, we enforce local rigidity with a lightweight add-on module in neural network design, enabling end-to-end learning. We design a discretized voting space that accommodates all possible translations and then identify the one shared by nearby points by differentiable voting. Additionally, to ensure computational efficiency, we operate on pillars rather than points and learn representative features for voting per pillar. We plug the Voting Module into popular model designs and evaluate its benefit on Argoverse 2 and Waymo datasets. We outperform baseline works with only marginal compute overhead.

This is especially important for scene understanding tasks with safety critical applications, such as in autonomous driving. Existing datasets allow evaluation of only knowns or unknowns - but not both, which is required to establish "in the wild" suitability of deep neural network models. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel anomaly segmentation dataset, ISSU, that features a diverse set of anomaly inputs from cluttered real-world environments. The dataset is twice larger than existing anomaly segmentation datasets, and provides a training, validation and test set for controlled in-domain evaluation. The test set consists of a static and temporal part, with the latter comprised of videos. The dataset provides annotations for both closed-set (knowns) and anomalies, enabling closed-set and open-set evaluation. The dataset covers diverse conditions, such as domain and cross-sensor shift, illumination variation and allows ablation of anomaly detection methods with respect to these variations. Evaluation results of current state-of-the-art methods confirm the need for improvements especially in domain-generalization, small and large object segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |

Although pretrained state-of-the-art generation models, guided by 2D layout conditions (e.g., HD maps and bounding boxes), can produce photorealistic driving videos, achieving controllable multi-view videos with high 3D consistency remains a major challenge. To tackle this, we introduce a novel spatial adaptive generation framework, CoGen, which leverages advances in 3D generation to improve performance in two key aspects: (i) To ensure 3D consistency, we first generate high-quality, controllable 3D conditions that capture the geometry of driving scenes. By replacing coarse 2D conditions with these fine-grained 3D representations, our approach significantly enhances the spatial consistency of the generated videos. (ii) Additionally, we introduce a consistency adapter module to strengthen the robustness of the model to multi-condition control. The results demonstrate that this method excels in preserving geometric fidelity and visual realism, offering a reliable video generation solution for autonomous driving.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-modal Knowledge Distillation-based Human Trajectory Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22201v1)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pedestrian trajectory forecasting is crucial in various applications such as autonomous driving and mobile robot navigation. In such applications, camera-based perception enables the extraction of additional modalities (human pose, text) to enhance prediction accuracy. Indeed, we find that textual descriptions play a crucial role in integrating additional modalities into a unified understanding. However, online extraction of text requires the use of VLM, which may not be feasible for resource-constrained systems. To address this challenge, we propose a multi-modal knowledge distillation framework: a student model with limited modality is distilled from a teacher model trained with full range of modalities. The comprehensive knowledge of a teacher model trained with trajectory, human pose, and text is distilled into a student model using only trajectory or human pose as a sole supplement. In doing so, we separately distill the core locomotion insights from intra-agent multi-modality and inter-agent interaction. Our generalizable framework is validated with two state-of-the-art models across three datasets on both ego-view (JRDB, SIT) and BEV-view (ETH/UCY) setups, utilizing both annotated and VLM-generated text captions. Distilled student models show consistent improvement in all prediction metrics for both full and instantaneous observations, improving up to ~13%.

Recent studies focus on integrating spatiotemporal information obtained from past observations to improve prediction accuracy, using a multi-frame fusion approach that processes multiple past frames together. However, these methods struggle with a trade-off between efficiency and accuracy, which significantly limits their practicality. To mitigate this trade-off, we propose StreamOcc, a novel framework that aggregates spatio-temporal information in a stream-based manner. StreamOcc consists of two key components: (i) Stream-based Voxel Aggregation, which effectively accumulates past observations while minimizing computational costs, and (ii) Query-guided Aggregation, which recurrently aggregates instance-level features of dynamic objects into corresponding voxel features, refining fine-grained details of dynamic objects. Experiments on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset show that StreamOcc achieves state-of-the-art performance in real-time settings, while reducing memory usage by more than 50% compared to previous methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Deep Learning Framework for Boundary-Aware Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22050v1)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a fundamental task in computer vision, semantic segmentation is widely applied in fields such as autonomous driving, remote sensing image analysis, and medical image processing. In recent years, Transformer-based segmentation methods have demonstrated strong performance in global feature modeling. However, they still struggle with blurred target boundaries and insufficient recognition of small targets. To address these issues, this study proposes a Mask2Former-based semantic segmentation algorithm incorporating a boundary enhancement feature bridging module (BEFBM). The goal is to improve target boundary accuracy and segmentation consistency. Built upon the Mask2Former framework, this method constructs a boundary-aware feature map and introduces a feature bridging mechanism. This enables effective cross-scale feature fusion, enhancing the model's ability to focus on target boundaries. Experiments on the Cityscapes dataset demonstrate that, compared to mainstream segmentation methods, the proposed approach achieves significant improvements in metrics such as mIOU, mDICE, and mRecall. It also exhibits superior boundary retention in complex scenes. Visual analysis further confirms the model's advantages in fine-grained regions. Future research will focus on optimizing computational efficiency and exploring its potential in other high-precision segmentation tasks.</p></details> |  |

Recently, state-of-the-art map vectorization methods are mainly based on DETR-like framework to generate HD maps in an end-to-end manner. In this paper, we propose InteractionMap, which improves previous map vectorization methods by fully leveraging local-to-global information interaction in both time and space. Firstly, we explore enhancing DETR-like detectors by explicit position relation prior from point-level to instance-level, since map elements contain strong shape priors. Secondly, we propose a key-frame-based hierarchical temporal fusion module, which interacts temporal information from local to global. Lastly, the separate classification branch and regression branch lead to the problem of misalignment in the output distribution. We interact semantic information with geometric information by introducing a novel geometric-aware classification loss in optimization and a geometric-aware matching cost in label assignment. InteractionMap achieves state-of-the-art performance on both nuScenes and Argoverse2 benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

To this end, we introduce $\textbf{VLADBench}$, a challenging and fine-grained dataset featuring close-form QAs that progress from static foundational knowledge and elements to advanced reasoning for dynamic on-road situations. The elaborate $\textbf{VLADBench}$ spans 5 key domains: Traffic Knowledge Understanding, General Element Recognition, Traffic Graph Generation, Target Attribute Comprehension, and Ego Decision-Making and Planning. These domains are further broken down into 11 secondary aspects and 29 tertiary tasks for a granular evaluation. A thorough assessment of general and domain-specific (DS) VLMs on this benchmark reveals both their strengths and critical limitations in AD contexts. To further exploit the cognitive and reasoning interactions among the 5 domains for AD understanding, we start from a small-scale VLM and train the DS models on individual domain datasets (collected from 1.4M DS QAs across public sources). The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed benchmark provides a crucial step toward a more comprehensive assessment of VLMs in AD, paving the way for the development of more cognitively sophisticated and reasoning-capable AD systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Generating Realistic 3D Semantic Training Data for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21449v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic scene understanding is crucial for robotics and computer vision applications. In autonomous driving, 3D semantic segmentation plays an important role for enabling safe navigation. Despite significant advances in the field, the complexity of collecting and annotating 3D data is a bottleneck in this developments. To overcome that data annotation limitation, synthetic simulated data has been used to generate annotated data on demand. There is still however a domain gap between real and simulated data. More recently, diffusion models have been in the spotlight, enabling close-to-real data synthesis. Those generative models have been recently applied to the 3D data domain for generating scene-scale data with semantic annotations. Still, those methods either rely on image projection or decoupled models trained with different resolutions in a coarse-to-fine manner. Such intermediary representations impact the generated data quality due to errors added in those transformations. In this work, we propose a novel approach able to generate 3D semantic scene-scale data without relying on any projection or decoupled trained multi-resolution models, achieving more realistic semantic scene data generation compared to previous state-of-the-art methods. Besides improving 3D semantic scene-scale data synthesis, we thoroughly evaluate the use of the synthetic scene samples as labeled data to train a semantic segmentation network. In our experiments, we show that using the synthetic annotated data generated by our method as training data together with the real semantic segmentation labels, leads to an improvement in the semantic segmentation model performance. Our results show the potential of generated scene-scale point clouds to generate more training data to extend existing datasets, reducing the data annotation effort.

The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers transformative potential to address these challenges. Extensive knowledge and high-level capabilities derived from pretraining evolve the default role of LLMs as text generators to become versatile, knowledge-driven task solvers for intelligent transportation systems. This survey first presents LLM4TR, a novel conceptual framework that systematically categorizes the roles of LLMs in transportation into four synergetic dimensions: information processors, knowledge encoders, component generators, and decision facilitators. Through a unified taxonomy, we systematically elucidate how LLMs bridge fragmented data pipelines, enhance predictive analytics, simulate human-like reasoning, and enable closed-loop interactions across sensing, learning, modeling, and managing tasks in transportation systems. For each role, our review spans diverse applications, from traffic prediction and autonomous driving to safety analytics and urban mobility optimization, highlighting how emergent capabilities of LLMs such as in-context learning and step-by-step reasoning can enhance the operation and management of transportation systems. We further curate practical guidance, including available resources and computational guidelines, to support real-world deployment. By identifying challenges in existing LLM-based solutions, this survey charts a roadmap for advancing LLM-driven transportation research, positioning LLMs as central actors in the next generation of cyber-physical-social mobility ecosystems.

However, classical reinforcement learning methods optimize policies by maximizing expected rewards but lack sufficient safety considerations, often putting agents in hazardous situations. This paper proposes a risk-aware reinforcement learning approach for autonomous driving to improve the safety performance when crossing the intersection. Safe critics are constructed to evaluate driving risk and work in conjunction with the reward critic to update the actor. Based on this, a Lagrangian relaxation method and cyclic gradient iteration are combined to project actions into a feasible safe region. Furthermore, a Multi-hop and Multi-layer perception (MLP) mixed Attention Mechanism (MMAM) is incorporated into the actor-critic network, enabling the policy to adapt to dynamic traffic and overcome permutation sensitivity challenges. This allows the policy to focus more effectively on surrounding potential risks while enhancing the identification of passing opportunities. Simulation tests are conducted on different tasks at unsignalized intersections. The results show that the proposed approach effectively reduces collision rates and improves crossing efficiency in comparison to baseline algorithms. Additionally, our ablation experiments demonstrate the benefits of incorporating risk-awareness and MMAM into RL.</p></details> | 11 pages, 10 figures |

To address this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive review of the methodologies and applications of LLMs in traffic and transportation, highlighting their ability to process unstructured textual data to advance transportation research. We explore key applications, including autonomous driving, travel behavior prediction, and general transportation-related queries, alongside methodologies such as zero- or few-shot learning, prompt engineering, and fine-tuning. Our analysis identifies critical research gaps. From the methodological perspective, many research gaps can be addressed by integrating LLMs with existing tools and refining LLM architectures. From the application perspective, we identify numerous opportunities for LLMs to tackle a variety of traffic and transportation challenges, building upon existing research. By synthesizing these findings, this review not only clarifies the current state of LLM adoption and adaptation in traffic and transportation but also proposes future research directions, paving the way for smarter and more sustainable transportation systems.</p></details> |  |

While AVs rely on sensor systems such as cameras, LiDAR, and radar to detect obstacles, this study suggests combining sensors with a knowledge graph (KG)-based world model to improve AVs' comprehension of physical material qualities. Beyond sensor data, AVs can infer qualities such as malleability, density, and elasticity using a semantic KG that depicts the relationships between obstacles and their attributes. Using the CARLA autonomous driving simulator, we evaluated AV performance with and without KG integration. The findings demonstrate that the KG-based method improves obstacle management, which allows AVs to use material qualities to make better decisions about when to change lanes or apply emergency braking. For example, the KG-integrated AV changed lanes for hard impediments like traffic cones and successfully avoided collisions with flexible items such as plastic bags by passing over them. Compared to the control system, the KG framework demonstrated improved responsiveness to obstacles by resolving conflicting sensor data, causing emergency stops for 13.3% more cases. In addition, our method exhibits a 6.6% higher success rate in lane-changing maneuvers in experimental scenarios, particularly for larger, high-impact obstacles. While we focus particularly on autonomous driving, our work demonstrates the potential of KG-based world models to improve decision-making in embodied AI systems and scale to other domains, including robotics, healthcare, and environmental simulation.</p></details> |  |

Integrated circuits (ICs) are the backbone of modern computing devices across industries, including artificial intelligence (AI), consumer electronics, healthcare, automotive, industrial, and aerospace. Moore Law has driven the semiconductor IC industry toward smaller dimensions, improved performance, and greater energy efficiency. However, as transistors shrink to atomic scales, aging-related degradation mechanisms such as Bias Temperature Instability (BTI), Hot Carrier Injection (HCI), Time-Dependent Dielectric Breakdown (TDDB), Electromigration (EM), and stochastic aging-induced variations have become major reliability threats.

Most existing methods for crafting physical-world adversarial examples are ad-hoc, relying on temporary modifications like shadows, laser beams, or stickers that are tailored to specific scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a new class of physical-world adversarial examples, AdvWT, which draws inspiration from the naturally occurring phenomenon of `wear and tear', an inherent property of physical objects. Unlike manually crafted perturbations, `wear and tear' emerges organically over time due to environmental degradation, as seen in the gradual deterioration of outdoor signboards. To achieve this, AdvWT follows a two-step approach. First, a GAN-based, unsupervised image-to-image translation network is employed to model these naturally occurring damages, particularly in the context of outdoor signboards. The translation network encodes the characteristics of damaged signs into a latent `damage style code'. In the second step, we introduce adversarial perturbations into the style code, strategically optimizing its transformation process. This manipulation subtly alters the damage style representation, guiding the network to generate adversarial images where the appearance of damages remains perceptually realistic, while simultaneously ensuring their effectiveness in misleading neural networks. Through comprehensive experiments on two traffic sign datasets, we show that AdvWT effectively misleads DNNs in both digital and physical domains. AdvWT achieves an effective attack success rate, greater robustness, and a more natural appearance compared to existing physical-world adversarial examples. Additionally, integrating AdvWT into training enhances a model's generalizability to real-world damaged signs.</p></details> | 11 pages, 9 figures |

This scenario naturally arises in various applications, such as autonomous driving and human-robot collaboration, where the behavior of uncontrollable agents, like pedestrians, cannot be directly controlled but is influenced by the actions of the autonomous vehicle or robot. In this paper, we present SPARC (Safe Prediction-Based Robust Controller for Coupled Agents), a novel framework designed to ensure safe control in the presence of coupled uncontrollable agents. SPARC leverages conformal prediction to quantify uncertainty in data-driven prediction of agent behavior. Particularly, we introduce a joint distribution-based approach to account for the coupled dynamics of the controlled system and uncontrollable agents. By integrating the control barrier function (CBF) technique, SPARC provides provable safety guarantees at a high confidence level.

Deep learning-based MDE predicts relative depth from a single image, but the lack of metric scale introduces inconsistencies, limiting applicability in tasks such as visual SLAM, 3D reconstruction, and novel view synthesis. Monocular Metric Depth Estimation (MMDE) overcomes this limitation by enabling precise scene-scale inference, improving depth consistency, enhancing stability in sequential tasks, and streamlining integration into practical systems. This paper systematically reviews the evolution of depth estimation, from traditional geometric methods to deep learning breakthroughs, emphasizing scale-agnostic approaches in zero-shot generalization which is crucial for advancing MMDE. Recent progress in zero-shot MMDE is examined, focusing on challenges such as model generalization and boundary detail loss. To address these issues, researchers have explored unlabeled data augmentation, image patching, architectural optimization, and generative techniques. This review analyzes these developments, assessing their impact and limitations. Key findings are synthesized, unresolved challenges outlined, and future research direction proposal. By providing a clear technical roadmap and insight into emerging trends, this work aims to drive innovation and expand the real-world applications of MMDE.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce SplatFlow, a Self-Supervised Dynamic Gaussian Splatting within Neural Motion Flow Fields (NMFF) to learn 4D space-time representations without requiring tracked 3D bounding boxes, enabling accurate dynamic scene reconstruction and novel view RGB/depth/flow synthesis. SplatFlow designs a unified framework to seamlessly integrate time-dependent 4D Gaussian representation within NMFF, where NMFF is a set of implicit functions to model temporal motions of both LiDAR points and Gaussians as continuous motion flow fields. Leveraging NMFF, SplatFlow effectively decomposes static background and dynamic objects, representing them with 3D and 4D Gaussian primitives, respectively. NMFF also models the correspondences of each 4D Gaussian across time, which aggregates temporal features to enhance cross-view consistency of dynamic components. SplatFlow further improves dynamic object identification by distilling features from 2D foundation models into 4D space-time representation. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on the Waymo and KITTI Datasets validate SplatFlow's state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance for both image reconstruction and novel view synthesis in dynamic urban scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, in level 3, a misunderstanding of the capabilities of the system might lead drivers to engage in secondary tasks, which could impair their ability to react to challenging traffic situations. Anticipating driver activity allows for early detection of risky behaviors, to prevent accidents. To be able to predict the driver activity, a Deep Learning network needs to be trained on a dataset. However, the use of datasets based on simulation for training and the migration to real-world data for prediction has proven to be suboptimal. Hence, this paper presents a real-world driver activity dataset, openly accessible on IEEE Dataport, which encompasses various activities that occur in autonomous driving scenarios under various illumination and weather conditions. Results from the training process showed that the dataset provides an excellent benchmark for implementing models for driver activity recognition.</p></details> | 6 pages |

BEV representation enables a variety of perception tasks including BEV segmentation, a concise view of the environment useful for planning a vehicle's trajectory. However, this representation is not fully supported by existing datasets, and creation of new datasets for this purpose can be a time-consuming endeavor. To address this challenge, we introduce SimBEV. SimBEV is a randomized synthetic data generation tool that is extensively configurable and scalable, supports a wide array of sensors, incorporates information from multiple sources to capture accurate BEV ground truth, and enables a variety of perception tasks including BEV segmentation and 3D object detection. SimBEV is used to create the SimBEV dataset, a large collection of annotated perception data from diverse driving scenarios.

While LiDAR and visual (RGB) sensors are commonly used, thermal imaging remains underrepresented in datasets, despite its acknowledged advantages for VRU detection in extreme lighting conditions. In this paper, we present R-LiViT, the first dataset to combine LiDAR, RGB, and thermal imaging from a roadside perspective, with a strong focus on VRUs. R-LiViT captures three intersections during both day and night, ensuring a diverse dataset.

While existing driving video generation methods may produce visually realistic videos, they often fail to deliver physically realistic simulations because they lack the capability to generate accurate post-collision trajectories. In this paper, we introduce AccidentSim, a novel framework that generates physically realistic vehicle collision videos by extracting and utilizing the physical clues and contextual information available in real-world vehicle accident reports. Specifically, AccidentSim leverages a reliable physical simulator to replicate post-collision vehicle trajectories from the physical and contextual information in the accident reports and to build a vehicle collision trajectory dataset. This dataset is then used to fine-tune a language model, enabling it to respond to user prompts and predict physically consistent post-collision trajectories across various driving scenarios based on user descriptions. Finally, we employ Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) to render high-quality backgrounds, merging them with the foreground vehicles that exhibit physically realistic trajectories to generate vehicle collision videos. Experimental results demonstrate that the videos produced by AccidentSim excel in both visual and physical authenticity.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce a multimodal generation framework that incorporates four major data modalities, including a novel addition of map modality. With tokenized modalities, our scene sequence generation framework autoregressively predicts each scene while managing computational demands through a two-stage approach. The Temporal AutoRegressive (TAR) component captures inter-frame dynamics for each modality while the Ordered AutoRegressive (OAR) component aligns modalities within each scene by sequentially predicting tokens in a fixed order. To maintain coherence between map and ego-action modalities, we introduce the Action-aware Map Alignment (AMA) module, which applies a transformation based on the ego-action to maintain coherence between these modalities. Our framework effectively generates complex, realistic driving scenes over extended sequences, ensuring multimodal consistency and offering fine-grained control over scene elements.

We introduce GAIA-2, Generative AI for Autonomy, a latent diffusion world model that unifies these capabilities within a single generative framework. GAIA-2 supports controllable video generation conditioned on a rich set of structured inputs: ego-vehicle dynamics, agent configurations, environmental factors, and road semantics. It generates high-resolution, spatiotemporally consistent multi-camera videos across geographically diverse driving environments (UK, US, Germany). The model integrates both structured conditioning and external latent embeddings (e.g., from a proprietary driving model) to facilitate flexible and semantically grounded scene synthesis. Through this integration, GAIA-2 enables scalable simulation of both common and rare driving scenarios, advancing the use of generative world models as a core tool in the development of autonomous systems.

| **[Unleashing HyDRa: Hybrid Fusion, Depth Consistency and Radar for Unified 3D Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07746v4)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-cost, vision-centric 3D perception systems for autonomous driving have made significant progress in recent years, narrowing the gap to expensive LiDAR-based methods. The primary challenge in becoming a fully reliable alternative lies in robust depth prediction capabilities, as camera-based systems struggle with long detection ranges and adverse lighting and weather conditions. In this work, we introduce HyDRa, a novel camera-radar fusion architecture for diverse 3D perception tasks. Building upon the principles of dense BEV (Bird's Eye View)-based architectures, HyDRa introduces a hybrid fusion approach to combine the strengths of complementary camera and radar features in two distinct representation spaces. Our Height Association Transformer module leverages radar features already in the perspective view to produce more robust and accurate depth predictions. In the BEV, we refine the initial sparse representation by a Radar-weighted Depth Consistency. HyDRa achieves a new state-of-the-art for camera-radar fusion of 64.2 NDS (+1.8) and 58.4 AMOTA (+1.5) on the public nuScenes dataset. Moreover, our new semantically rich and spatially accurate BEV features can be directly converted into a powerful occupancy representation, beating all previous camera-based methods on the Occ3D benchmark by an impressive 3.7 mIoU.

This paper introduces TopoBDA (Topology with Bezier Deformable Attention), a novel approach that enhances road topology comprehension by leveraging Bezier Deformable Attention (BDA). TopoBDA processes multi-camera 360-degree imagery to generate Bird's Eye View (BEV) features, which are refined through a transformer decoder employing BDA. BDA utilizes Bezier control points to drive the deformable attention mechanism, improving the detection and representation of elongated and thin polyline structures, such as lane centerlines. Additionally, TopoBDA integrates two auxiliary components: an instance mask formulation loss and a one-to-many set prediction loss strategy, to further refine centerline detection and enhance road topology understanding. Experimental evaluations on the OpenLane-V2 dataset demonstrate that TopoBDA outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results in centerline detection and topology reasoning. TopoBDA also achieves the best results on the OpenLane-V1 dataset in 3D lane detection. Further experiments on integrating multi-modal data -- such as LiDAR, radar, and SDMap -- show that multimodal inputs can further enhance performance in road topology understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hi-ALPS -- An Experimental Robustness Quantification of Six LiDAR-based Object Detection Systems for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17168v2)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) is an essential sensor technology for autonomous driving as it can capture high-resolution 3D data. As 3D object detection systems (OD) can interpret such point cloud data, they play a key role in the driving decisions of autonomous vehicles. Consequently, such 3D OD must be robust against all types of perturbations and must therefore be extensively tested. One approach is the use of adversarial examples, which are small, sometimes sophisticated perturbations in the input data that change, i.e., falsify, the prediction of the OD. These perturbations are carefully designed based on the weaknesses of the OD. The robustness of the OD cannot be quantified with adversarial examples in general, because if the OD is vulnerable to a given attack, it is unclear whether this is due to the robustness of the OD or whether the attack algorithm produces particularly strong adversarial examples. The contribution of this work is Hi-ALPS -- Hierarchical Adversarial-example-based LiDAR Perturbation Level System, where higher robustness of the OD is required to withstand the perturbations as the perturbation levels increase. In doing so, the Hi-ALPS levels successively implement a heuristic followed by established adversarial example approaches. In a series of comprehensive experiments using Hi-ALPS, we quantify the robustness of six state-of-the-art 3D OD under different types of perturbations. The results of the experiments show that none of the OD is robust against all Hi-ALPS levels; an important factor for the ranking is that human observers can still correctly recognize the perturbed objects, as the respective perturbations are small. To increase the robustness of the OD, we discuss the applicability of state-of-the-art countermeasures. In addition, we derive further suggestions for countermeasures based on our experimental results.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing methods lack generalization and are limited to specific tasks such as image recovery. To address these issues, we propose Gated-Mechanism Mixture-of-Experts (GM-MoE), the first framework to introduce a mixture-of-experts network for low-light image enhancement. GM-MoE comprises a dynamic gated weight conditioning network and three sub-expert networks, each specializing in a distinct enhancement task. Combining a self-designed gated mechanism that dynamically adjusts the weights of the sub-expert networks for different data domains. Additionally, we integrate local and global feature fusion within sub-expert networks to enhance image quality by capturing multi-scale features. Experimental results demonstrate that the GM-MoE achieves superior generalization with respect to 25 compared approaches, reaching state-of-the-art performance on PSNR on 5 benchmarks and SSIM on 4 benchmarks, respectively.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances have improved the spatial reasoning ability of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by introducing large-scale data, but these models still struggle to analyze kinematic elements like traveled distance and speed of moving objects. To bridge this gap, we construct a spatio-temporal reasoning dataset and benchmark involving kinematic instruction tuning, referred to as STKit and STKit-Bench. They consist of real-world videos with 3D annotations, detailing object motion dynamics: traveled distance, speed, movement direction, inter-object distance comparisons, and relative movement direction. To further scale such data construction to videos without 3D labels, we propose an automatic pipeline to generate pseudo-labels using 4D reconstruction in real-world scale. With our kinematic instruction tuning data for spatio-temporal reasoning, we present ST-VLM, a VLM enhanced for spatio-temporal reasoning, which exhibits outstanding performance on STKit-Bench. Furthermore, we show that ST-VLM generalizes robustly across diverse domains and tasks, outperforming baselines on other spatio-temporal benchmarks (eg, ActivityNet, TVQA+). Finally, by integrating learned spatio-temporal reasoning with existing abilities, ST-VLM enables complex multi-step reasoning. Project page: https://ikodoh.github.io/ST-VLM.</p></details> |  |

Coupling of renewable power supplies to water electrolysis processes is, however, challenging, as explosive gas mixtures (hydrogen in oxygen) might form at low loads. This has prompted research into gas purity control of such systems. While these attempts have shown to be successful in theoretical and practical studies, they are currently limited in that they only consider the gas purity at locations where composition measurements are available. As these locations are generally positioned downstream of the disturbance origin, this incurs considerable delays and can lead to undetected critical conditions. In this work, we propose the use of an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) in combination with a simple process model to estimate and control the gas composition at locations where measurements are not available. The model uses noise-driven states for the gas impurity and is hence agnostic towards any mechanistic disturbance model. We show in simulations that this simple approach performs well under various disturbance types and can reduce the time spent in potentially hazardous conditions by up to one order of magnitude.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 14th IFAC Symposium on Dynamics and Control of Process Systems, including Biosystems (DYCOPS 2025). 6 pages, 5 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

The dimension of the temporal measurement vector is lower than that of the temporal state vector to be estimated, leading to an under-determined inverse problem. The underlying dynamical model of the state's evolution is unknown for a 'model-free process.' Hence, it is difficult to use traditional model-driven methods, for example, Kalman and particle filters. Instead, we consider data-driven methods. We experimentally show that two existing unsupervised learning-based data-driven methods fail to address the BSCM problem in a model-free process. The methods are -- data-driven nonlinear state estimation (DANSE) and deep Markov model (DMM). While DANSE provides good predictive/forecasting performance to model the temporal measurement data as a time series, its unsupervised learning lacks suitable regularization for tackling the BSCM task. We then propose a semi-supervised learning approach and develop a semi-supervised learning-based DANSE method, referred to as SemiDANSE. In SemiDANSE, we use a large amount of unlabelled data along with a limited amount of labelled data, i.e., pairwise measurement-and-state data, which provides the desired regularization. Using three benchmark dynamical systems, we show that the data-driven SemiDANSE provides competitive state estimation performance for BSCM against a hybrid method called KalmanNet and two model-driven methods (extended Kalman filter and unscented Kalman filter) that know the dynamical models exactly.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, under review at IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing</p></details> |

This paper proposes a method integrating Image-Based Visual Servoing (IBVS) with proportional navigation guidance (PNG), reducing the multicopter's overload in the final interception phase. It combines smoother trajectories from the IBVS controller with high-frequency target 2D position estimation via a delayed Kalman filter (DKF) to minimize the impact of image processing delays on accuracy. In addition, a field-of-view (FOV) holding controller is designed for stability of the visual servo system. Experimental results show a circular error probability (CEP) of 0.089 m (72.8% lower than the latest relevant IBVS work) in simulations and over 80\% interception success under wind conditions below 4 m/s in real world. These results demonstrate the system's potential for precise low-altitude interception of non-cooperative targets.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 17 figures, has been accepted by the Journal of IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics</p></details> |

The estimation of the latent model parameters is based on second-order properties of the count and underlying Gaussian time series, yielding estimators of the underlying covariance matrices for which standard principal component analysis applies. Theoretical consistency results are established for the proposed estimation, building on certain concentration results for the models of the type considered. They also involve the memory of the latent Gaussian process, quantified through a spectral gap, shown to be suitably bounded as the model dimension increases, which is of independent interest. In addition, novel cross-validation schemes are suggested for model selection. The forecasting is carried out through a particle-based sequential Monte Carlo, leveraging Kalman filtering techniques. A simulation study and an application are also considered.</p></details> |  |

We introduce three Neural Network (NN) models that address key challenges in MOT: (i) the Single-Prediction Network (SPENT) for trajectory prediction, (ii) the Single-Association Network (SANT) for mapping individual Sensor Object (SO) to existing tracks, and (iii) the Multi-Association Network (MANTa) for associating multiple SOs to multiple tracks. These models are seamlessly integrated into a traditional Kalman Filter (KF) framework, maintaining the system's modularity by replacing relevant components without disrupting the overall architecture. Importantly, all three networks are designed to be run in a realtime, embedded environment. Each network contains less than 50k trainable parameters. Our evaluation, conducted on the public KITTI tracking dataset, demonstrates significant improvements in tracking performance. SPENT reduces the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) by 50% compared to a standard KF, while SANT and MANTa achieve up to 95% accuracy in sensor object-to-track assignments. These results underscore the effectiveness of incorporating task-specific NNs into traditional tracking systems, boosting performance and robustness while preserving modularity, maintainability, and interpretability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Autonomous optical navigation for DESTINY+: Enhancing misalignment robustness in flyby observations with a rotating telescope](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01835v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>DESTINY+ is an upcoming JAXA Epsilon medium-class mission to flyby multiple asteroids including Phaethon. As an asteroid flyby observation instrument, a telescope mechanically capable of single-axis rotation, named TCAP, is mounted on the spacecraft to track and observe the target asteroids during flyby. As in past flyby missions utilizing rotating telescopes, TCAP is also used as a navigation camera for autonomous optical navigation during the closest-approach phase. To mitigate the degradation of the navigation accuracy, past missions performed calibration of the navigation camera's alignment before starting optical navigation. However, such calibration requires significant operational time to complete and imposes constraints on the operation sequence. From the above background, the DESTINY+ team has studied the possibility of reducing operational costs by allowing TCAP alignment errors to remain. This paper describes an autonomous optical navigation algorithm robust to the misalignment of rotating telescopes, proposed in this context. In the proposed method, the misalignment of the telescope is estimated simultaneously with the spacecraft's orbit relative to the flyby target. To deal with the nonlinearity between the misalignment and the observation value, the proposed method utilizes the unscented Kalman filter, instead of the extended Kalman filter widely used in past studies. The proposed method was evaluated with numerical simulations on a PC and with hardware-in-the-loop simulation, taking the Phaethon flyby in the DESTINY+ mission as an example. The validation results suggest that the proposed method can mitigate the misalignment-induced degradation of the optical navigation accuracy with reasonable computational costs suited for onboard computers.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 25 figures, submitted to Acta Astronautica</p></details> |

By utilizing generic exteroceptive measurements in combination with an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), we reformulate the vehicle's dynamics and outputs to fit within a linear time-varying (LTV) framework. This transformation enables the application of a linear continuous-time Kalman filter, thereby avoiding the complexities of nonlinear estimators and local Kalman-type filtering methods (e.g., EKF). We perform a complete uniform observability analysis for key benchmark problems (e.g., GPS-INS and Landmark-INS) and derive sufficient conditions for ensuring global uniform exponential stability. Simulations are conducted for two practical applications: stereo-aided inertial navigation systems (INS) with both constant and time-varying gains, as well as GPS-aided INS. The proposed approach notably simplifies observer design for INS.</p></details> | 8 pages |

This study introduces Deep LG-Track, a novel multi-object tracker that incorporates three key enhancements to improve the tracking accuracy and robustness. First, an adaptive Kalman filter is developed to dynamically update the covariance of measurement noise based on detection confidence and trajectory disappearance. Second, a novel cost matrix is formulated to adaptively fuse motion and appearance information, leveraging localization confidence and detection confidence as weighting factors. Third, a dynamic appearance feature updating strategy is introduced, adjusting the relative weighting of historical and current appearance features based on appearance clarity and localization accuracy. Comprehensive evaluations on the MOT17 and MOT20 datasets demonstrate that the proposed Deep LG-Track consistently outperforms state-of-the-art trackers across multiple performance metrics, highlighting its effectiveness in multi-object tracking tasks.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 fugures |

Indoor drone localization and tracking are arguably a crucial, yet unsolved challenge: in GPS-denied environments, existing approaches enjoy limited applicability, especially in Non-Line of Sight (NLoS), require extensive environment instrumentation, or demand considerable hardware/software changes on drones. In contrast, AIM exploits the acoustic characteristics of the drones to estimate their location and derive their motion, even in NLoS settings. We tame location estimation errors using a dedicated Kalman filter and the Interquartile Range rule (IQR). We implement AIM using an off-the-shelf microphone array and evaluate its performance with a commercial drone under varied settings. Results indicate that the mean localization error of AIM is 46% lower than commercial UWB-based systems in complex indoor scenarios, where state-of-the-art infrared systems would not even work because of NLoS settings. We further demonstrate that AIM can be extended to support indoor spaces with arbitrary ranges and layouts without loss of accuracy by deploying distributed microphone arrays.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2504.00445</p></details> |

These models play an increasingly important role in machine learning and generative modelling. For finite spaces, these problems are commonly solved using Sinkhorn algorithm (a.k.a. iterative proportional fitting procedure). However, in more general settings the Sinkhorn iterations are based on nonlinear conditional/conjugate transformations and exact finite-dimensional solutions cannot be computed. This article presents a finite-dimensional recursive formulation of the iterative proportional fitting procedure for general Gaussian multivariate models. As expected, this recursive formulation is closely related to the celebrated Kalman filter and related Riccati matrix difference equations, and it yields algorithms that can be implemented in practical settings without further approximations. We extend this filtering methodology to develop a refined and self-contained convergence analysis of Gaussian Sinkhorn algorithms, including closed form expressions of entropic transport maps and Schr\"odinger bridges.</p></details> | 74 pages |

| **[Efficient State Estimation of a Networked FlipIt Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01096v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Boolean Kalman Filter and associated Boolean Dynamical System Theory have been proposed to study the spread of infection on computer networks. Such models feature a network where attacks propagate through, an intrusion detection system that provides noisy signals of the true state of the network, and the capability of the defender to clean a subset of computers at any time. The Boolean Kalman Filter has been used to solve the optimal estimation problem, by estimating the hidden true state given the attack-defense dynamics and noisy observations. However, this algorithm is infeasible because it runs in exponential time and space with respect to the network size. We address this feasibility problem by proposing a mean-field estimation approach, which is inspired by the epidemic modeling literature. Although our approach is heuristic, we prove that our estimator exactly matches the optimal estimator in certain non-trivial cases. We conclude by using simulations to show both the run-time improvement and estimation accuracy of our approach.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose an in-context learning framework leveraging transformer-based models to perform zero-shot speed estimation using only electrical measurements. By training the filter offline on simulated motor trajectories, we enable real-time inference on unseen real motors without retraining, eliminating the need for explicit system identification while retaining adaptability to varying operating conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional Kalman filter-based estimators, especially in low-speed regimes that are crucial during motor startup.</p></details> |  |
| **[Indoor Drone Localization and Tracking Based on Acoustic Inertial Measurement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00445v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Acoustic Inertial Measurement (AIM), a one-of-a-kind technique for indoor drone localization and tracking. Indoor drone localization and tracking are arguably a crucial, yet unsolved challenge: in GPS-denied environments, existing approaches enjoy limited applicability, especially in Non-Line of Sight (NLoS), require extensive environment instrumentation, or demand considerable hardware/software changes on drones. In contrast, AIM exploits the acoustic characteristics of the drones to estimate their location and derive their motion, even in NLoS settings. We tame location estimation errors using a dedicated Kalman filter and the Interquartile Range rule (IQR) and demonstrate that AIM can support indoor spaces with arbitrary ranges and layouts. We implement AIM using an off-the-shelf microphone array and evaluate its performance with a commercial drone under varied settings. Results indicate that the mean localization error of AIM is 46% lower than that of commercial UWB-based systems in a complex 10m\times10m indoor scenario, where state-of-the-art infrared systems would not even work because of NLoS situations. When distributed microphone arrays are deployed, the mean error can be reduced to less than 0.5m in a 20m range, and even support spaces with arbitrary ranges and layouts.</p></details> |  |
| **[CaLiV: LiDAR-to-Vehicle Calibration of Arbitrary Sensor Setups via Object Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01987v1)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In autonomous systems, sensor calibration is essential for a safe and efficient navigation in dynamic environments. Accurate calibration is a prerequisite for reliable perception and planning tasks such as object detection and obstacle avoidance. Many existing LiDAR calibration methods require overlapping fields of view, while others use external sensing devices or postulate a feature-rich environment. In addition, Sensor-to-Vehicle calibration is not supported by the vast majority of calibration algorithms. In this work, we propose a novel target-based technique for extrinsic Sensor-to-Sensor and Sensor-to-Vehicle calibration of multi-LiDAR systems called CaLiV. This algorithm works for non-overlapping FoVs, as well as arbitrary calibration targets, and does not require any external sensing devices. First, we apply motion to produce FoV overlaps and utilize a simple unscented Kalman filter to obtain vehicle poses. Then, we use the Gaussian mixture model-based registration framework GMMCalib to align the point clouds in a common calibration frame. Finally, we reduce the task of recovering the sensor extrinsics to a minimization problem. We show that both translational and rotational Sensor-to-Sensor errors can be solved accurately by our method. In addition, all Sensor-to-Vehicle rotation angles can also be calibrated with high accuracy. We validate the simulation results in real-world experiments. The code is open source and available on https://github.com/TUMFTM/CaLiV.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Steady-State Distributionally Robust Kalman Filter](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23742v1)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State estimation in the presence of uncertain or data-driven noise distributions remains a critical challenge in control and robotics. Although the Kalman filter is the most popular choice, its performance degrades significantly when distributional mismatches occur, potentially leading to instability or divergence. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel steady-state distributionally robust (DR) Kalman filter that leverages Wasserstein ambiguity sets to explicitly account for uncertainties in both process and measurement noise distributions. Our filter achieves computational efficiency by requiring merely the offline solution of a single convex semidefinite program, which yields a constant DR Kalman gain for robust state estimation under distributional mismatches. Additionally, we derive explicit theoretical conditions on the ambiguity set radius that ensure the asymptotic convergence of the time-varying DR Kalman filter to the proposed steady-state solution. Numerical simulations demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing baseline filters in terms of robustness and accuracy across both Gaussian and non-Gaussian uncertainty scenarios, highlighting its significant potential for real-world control and estimation applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rapid updating of multivariate resource models based on new information using EnKF-MDA and multi-Gaussian transformation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04694v2)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rapid resource model updating with real-time data is important for making timely decisions in resource management and mining operations. This requires optimal merging of models and observations, which can be achieved through data assimilation, and the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) has become a popular method for this task. However, the modelled resources in mining usually consist of multiple variables of interest with multivariate relationships of varying complexity. EnKF is not a multivariate approach, and even for univariate cases, there may be slight deviations between its outcomes and observations. This study presents a methodology for rapidly updating multivariate resource models using the EnKF with multiple data assimilations (EnKF-MDA) combined with rotation based iterative Gaussianisation (RBIG). EnKF-MDA improves the updating by assimilating the same data multiple times with an inflated measurement error, while RBIG quickly transforms the data into multi-Gaussian factors. The application of the proposed algorithm is validated by a real case study with nine cross-correlated variables. The combination of EnKF-MDA and RBIG successfully improves the accuracy of resource model updates, minimises uncertainty, and preserves the multivariate relationships.</p></details> |  |

| **[Inverse Particle Filter](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16623v3)** | 2025-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In cognitive systems, recent emphasis has been placed on studying the cognitive processes of the subject whose behavior was the primary focus of the system's cognitive response. This approach, known as inverse cognition, arises in counter-adversarial applications and has motivated the development of inverse Bayesian filters. In this context, a cognitive adversary, such as a radar, uses a forward Bayesian filter to track its target of interest. An inverse filter is then employed to infer the adversary's estimate of the target's or defender's state. Previous studies have addressed this inverse filtering problem by introducing methods like the inverse Kalman filter (KF), inverse extended KF, and inverse unscented KF. However, these filters typically assume additive Gaussian noise models and/or rely on local approximations of non-linear dynamics at the state estimates, limiting their practical application. In contrast, this paper adopts a global filtering approach and presents the development of an inverse particle filter (I-PF). The particle filter framework employs Monte Carlo (MC) methods to approximate arbitrary posterior distributions. Moreover, under mild system-level conditions, the proposed I-PF demonstrates convergence to the optimal inverse filter. Additionally, we propose the differentiable I-PF to address scenarios where system information is unknown to the defender. Using the recursive Cramer-Rao lower bound and non-credibility index (NCI), our numerical experiments for different systems demonstrate the estimation performance and time complexity of the proposed filter.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Adaptive Curves for Optimally Efficient Market Making](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13794v2)** | 2025-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated Market Makers (AMMs) are essential in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) as they match liquidity supply with demand. They function through liquidity providers (LPs) who deposit assets into liquidity pools. However, the asset trading prices in these pools often trail behind those in more dynamic, centralized exchanges, leading to potential arbitrage losses for LPs. This issue is tackled by adapting market maker bonding curves to trader behavior, based on the classical market microstructure model of Glosten and Milgrom. Our approach ensures a zero-profit condition for the market maker's prices. We derive the differential equation that an optimal adaptive curve should follow to minimize arbitrage losses while remaining competitive. Solutions to this optimality equation are obtained for standard Gaussian and Lognormal price models using Kalman filtering. A key feature of our method is its ability to estimate the external market price without relying on price or loss oracles. We also provide an equivalent differential equation for the implied dynamics of canonical static bonding curves and establish conditions for their optimality. Our algorithms demonstrate robustness to changing market conditions and adversarial perturbations, and we offer an on-chain implementation using Uniswap v4 alongside off-chain AI co-processors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Underwater Navigation through Cross-Correlation-Aware Deep INS/DVL Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21727v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The accurate navigation of autonomous underwater vehicles critically depends on the precision of Doppler velocity log (DVL) velocity measurements. Recent advancements in deep learning have demonstrated significant potential in improving DVL outputs by leveraging spatiotemporal dependencies across multiple sensor modalities. However, integrating these estimates into model-based filters, such as the extended Kalman filter, introduces statistical inconsistencies, most notably, cross-correlations between process and measurement noise. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing a cross-correlation-aware deep INS/DVL fusion framework. Building upon BeamsNet, a convolutional neural network designed to estimate AUV velocity using DVL and inertial data, we integrate its output into a navigation filter that explicitly accounts for the cross-correlation induced between the noise sources. This approach improves filter consistency and better reflects the underlying sensor error structure. Evaluated on two real-world underwater trajectories, the proposed method outperforms both least squares and cross-correlation-neglecting approaches in terms of state uncertainty. Notably, improvements exceed 10% in velocity and misalignment angle confidence metrics. Beyond demonstrating empirical performance, this framework provides a theoretically principled mechanism for embedding deep learning outputs within stochastic filters.</p></details> |  |

| **[Cubature Kalman Filter as a Robust State Estimator Against Model Uncertainty and Cyber Attacks in Power Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21070v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is known that the conventional estimators such as extended Kalman filter (EKF) and unscented Kalman filter (UKF) may provide favorable performance; However, they may not guarantee the robustness against model uncertainty and cyber attacks. In this paper, we compare the performance of cubature Kalman filter (CKF) to the conventional nonlinear estimator, the EKF, under the affect of model uncertainty and cyber-attack. We show that the CKF has better estimation accuracy than the EKF under some conditions. In order to verify our claim, we have tested the performance various nonlinear estimators on the single machine infinite-bus (SMIB) system under different scenarios. We show that (1) the CKF provides better estimation results than the EKF; (2) the CKF is able to detect different types of cyber attacks reliably which is superior to the EKF.</p></details> |  |

We quantitatively evaluate our method using real night sky data, comparing its results with those from a space-ready active-pixel sensor (APS) star tracker. We demonstrate that our method is an order-of-magnitude more accurate than existing methods due to improved signal modeling and state estimation, while providing more frequent updates and greater motion tolerance than conventional APS trackers. We provide all code and the first dataset of events synchronized with APS solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted into the proceedings of the Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) for 2025.

| **[MM-LINS: a Multi-Map LiDAR-Inertial System for Over-Degenerate Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19506v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>SLAM plays a crucial role in automation tasks, such as warehouse logistics, healthcare robotics, and restaurant delivery. These scenes come with various challenges, including navigating around crowds of people, dealing with flying plastic bags that can temporarily blind sensors, and addressing reduced LiDAR density caused by cooking smoke. Such scenarios can result in over-degeneracy, causing the map to drift. To address this issue, this paper presents a multi-map LiDAR-inertial system (MM-LINS) for the first time. The front-end employs an iterated error state Kalman filter for state estimation and introduces a reliable evaluation strategy for degeneracy detection. If over-degeneracy is detected, the active map will be stored into sleeping maps. Subsequently, the system continuously attempts to construct new maps using a dynamic initialization method to ensure successful initialization upon leaving the over-degeneracy. Regarding the back-end, the Scan Context descriptor is utilized to detect inter-map similarity. Upon successful recognition of a sleeping map that shares a common region with the active map, the overlapping trajectory region is utilized to constrain the positional transformation near the edge of the prior map. In response to this, a constraint-enhanced map fusion strategy is proposed to achieve high-precision positional and mapping results. Experiments have been conducted separately on both public datasets that exhibited over-degenerate conditions and in real-world environments. These tests demonstrated the effectiveness of MM-LINS in over-degeneracy environment.

| **[NextStop: An Improved Tracker For Panoptic LIDAR Segmentation Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06235v2)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>4D panoptic LiDAR segmentation is essential for scene understanding in autonomous driving and robotics, combining semantic and instance segmentation with temporal consistency. Current methods, like 4D-PLS and 4D-STOP, use a tracking-by-detection methodology, employing deep learning networks to perform semantic and instance segmentation on each frame. To maintain temporal consistency, large-size instances detected in the current frame are compared and associated with instances within a temporal window that includes the current and preceding frames. However, their reliance on short-term instance detection, lack of motion estimation, and exclusion of small-sized instances lead to frequent identity switches and reduced tracking performance. We address these issues with the NextStop1 tracker, which integrates Kalman filter-based motion estimation, data association, and lifespan management, along with a tracklet state concept to improve prioritization. Evaluated using the LiDAR Segmentation and Tracking Quality (LSTQ) metric on the SemanticKITTI validation set, NextStop demonstrated enhanced tracking performance, particularly for small-sized objects like people and bicyclists, with fewer ID switches, earlier tracking initiation, and improved reliability in complex environments.

Initially, an EKF is proposed to enhance robustness in estimating UAV states, thereby reducing the impact of measured noises and external disturbances. By locally linearizing UAV systems, the EKF can mitigate the disadvantages of the Kalman filter and reduce the computational cost of other nonlinear observers. Subsequently, in comparison to other related work in terms of stability and computational cost, the HSMC framework shows its outperformance in allowing the quadrotor UAVs to track the references. Three types of HSMC Aggregated HSMC, Incremental HSMC, and Combining HSMC are investigated for their effectiveness in tracking reference trajectories. Moreover, the stability of the quadrotor UAVs is rigorously analyzed using the Lyapunov stability principle. Finally, experimental results and comparative analyses demonstrate the efficacy and feasibility of the proposed methodologies.</p></details> |  |
| **[KOALA: A Kalman Optimization Algorithm with Loss Adaptivity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03331v3)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimization is often cast as a deterministic problem, where the solution is found through some iterative procedure such as gradient descent. However, when training neural networks the loss function changes over (iteration) time due to the randomized selection of a subset of the samples. This randomization turns the optimization problem into a stochastic one. We propose to consider the loss as a noisy observation with respect to some reference optimum. This interpretation of the loss allows us to adopt Kalman filtering as an optimizer, as its recursive formulation is designed to estimate unknown parameters from noisy measurements. Moreover, we show that the Kalman Filter dynamical model for the evolution of the unknown parameters can be used to capture the gradient dynamics of advanced methods such as Momentum and Adam. We call this stochastic optimization method KOALA, which is short for Kalman Optimization Algorithm with Loss Adaptivity. KOALA is an easy to implement, scalable, and efficient method to train neural networks. We provide convergence analysis and show experimentally that it yields parameter estimates that are on par with or better than existing state of the art optimization algorithms across several neural network architectures and machine learning tasks, such as computer vision and language modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at AAAI2022</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Transformed Gaussian Process State-Space Models for Non-Stationary High-Dimensional Dynamical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18309v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gaussian process state-space models (GPSSMs) have emerged as a powerful framework for modeling dynamical systems, offering interpretable uncertainty quantification and inherent regularization. However, existing GPSSMs face significant challenges in handling high-dimensional, non-stationary systems due to computational inefficiencies, limited scalability, and restrictive stationarity assumptions. In this paper, we propose an efficient transformed Gaussian process state-space model (ETGPSSM) to address these limitations. Our approach leverages a single shared Gaussian process (GP) combined with normalizing flows and Bayesian neural networks, enabling efficient modeling of complex, high-dimensional state transitions while preserving scalability. To address the lack of closed-form expressions for the implicit process in the transformed GP, we follow its generative process and introduce an efficient variational inference algorithm, aided by the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), to enable computationally tractable learning and inference. Extensive empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our ETGPSSM in system dynamics learning, high-dimensional state estimation, and time-series forecasting, outperforming existing GPSSMs and neural network-based methods in both accuracy and computational efficiency.</p></details> | 13 pages, 6 figures |

| **[Learning Optimal Filters Using Variational Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18066v3)** | 2025-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Filtering - the task of estimating the conditional distribution for states of a dynamical system given partial and noisy observations - is important in many areas of science and engineering, including weather and climate prediction. However, the filtering distribution is generally intractable to obtain for high-dimensional, nonlinear systems. Filters used in practice, such as the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), provide biased probabilistic estimates for nonlinear systems and have numerous tuning parameters. Here, we present a framework for learning a parameterized analysis map - the transformation that takes samples from a forecast distribution, and combines with an observation, to update the approximate filtering distribution - using variational inference. In principle this can lead to a better approximation of the filtering distribution, and hence smaller bias. We show that this methodology can be used to learn the gain matrix, in an affine analysis map, for filtering linear and nonlinear dynamical systems; we also study the learning of inflation and localization parameters for an EnKF. The framework developed here can also be used to learn new filtering algorithms with more general forms for the analysis map.</p></details> | 21 pages, 6 figures |

We identify the parameters to be updated using the gradient of the loss function and use the SEKF to update only these parameters. We compare finetuning and SEKF for online model maintenance in the presence of systemic drift through four dynamic regression case studies and find that the SEKF is able to maintain model accuracy as-well if not better than finetuning while requiring significantly less time per iteration, and less hyperparameter tuning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Statistical accuracy of the ensemble Kalman filter in the near-linear setting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16154v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating the state of a dynamical system from partial and noisy observations is a ubiquitous problem in a large number of applications, such as probabilistic weather forecasting and prediction of epidemics. Particle filters are a widely adopted approach to the problem and provide provably accurate approximations of the statistics of the state, but they perform poorly in high dimensions because of weight collapse. The ensemble Kalman filter does not suffer from this issue, as it relies on an interacting particle system with equal weights. Despite its wide adoption in the geophysical sciences, mathematical analysis of the accuracy of this filter is predominantly confined to the setting of linear dynamical models and linear observations operators, and analysis beyond the linear Gaussian setting is still in its infancy. In this short note, we provide an accessible overview of recent work in which the authors take first steps to analyze the accuracy of the filter beyond the linear Gaussian setting.</p></details> |  |

The method incorporates a subsampling strategy to ensure stability and, when necessary, employs unsupervised clustering to refine the conditional estimate.

This challenge is more significant for snake robots in ophthalmic surgery applications, such as the Improved Integrated Robotic Intraocular Snake (I$^2$RIS), given its small size and lack of embedded sensory feedback. Data-driven models take advantage of global function approximations, reducing complicated analytical models' challenge and computational costs. However, their performance might deteriorate in case of new data unseen in the training phase. Therefore, adding an adaptation mechanism might improve these models' performance during snake robots' interactions with unknown environments. In this work, we applied a model predictive path integral (MPPI) controller on a data-driven model of the I$^2$RIS based on the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and Gaussian mixture regression (GMR). To analyze the performance of the MPPI in unseen robot-tissue interaction situations, unknown external disturbances and environmental loads are simulated and added to the GMM-GMR model. These uncertainties of the robot model are then identified online using a radial basis function (RBF) whose weights are updated using an extended Kalman filter (EKF). Simulation results demonstrated the robustness of the optimal control solutions of the MPPI algorithm and its computational superiority over a conventional model predictive control (MPC) algorithm.</p></details> |  |

The simultaneous identification of causal-andanticausal subsystems, along with the presence of random switching sequences, however, make the overall identification problem particularly challenging. To this end, we develop an expectation-maximization (EM) based system identification technique, where the E-step proposes a modified Kalman filter (KF) to estimate the states and switching sequences of causal-and-anticausal subsystems, while the M-step consists in a switching least-squares algorithm to estimate the parameters of individual subsystems. We establish the main convergence features of the proposed identification procedure, also providing bounds on the parameter estimation errors under mild conditions. Finally, the effectiveness of our identification method is validated through two numerical simulations.</p></details> |  |

To overcome the shortcomings of standalone UWB systems in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios and the inherent drift associated with inertial navigation, we developed a novel hybrid fusion framework. First, a dynamic covariance estimation mechanism is incorporated, which automatically adjusts measurement weights based on real-time channel conditions. Then, a tightly-coupled sensor fusion architecture is employed, utilizing IMU pre-integration theory for temporal synchronization. Finally, a sliding-window factor graph optimization backend is utilized, incorporating NLOS mitigation constraints. Experimental results in complex indoor environments show a 38\% improvement in positioning accuracy compared to conventional Kalman filter-based approaches, achieving a 12.3 cm root mean square (RMS) error under dynamic motion conditions. The system maintains robust performance even with intermittent UWB signal availability, down to a 40\% packet reception rate, effectively suppressing IMU drift through multi-modal constraint fusion. This work offers a practical solution for applications that require reliable indoor positioning in GPS-denied environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ensemble Kalman-Bucy filtering for nonlinear model predictive control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12474v1)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of optimal control for partially observed dynamical systems. Despite its prevalence in practical applications, there are still very few algorithms available, which take uncertainties in the current state estimates and future observations into account. In other words, most current approaches separate state estimation from the optimal control problem. In this paper, we extend the popular ensemble Kalman filter to receding horizon optimal control problems in the spirit of nonlinear model predictive control. We provide an interacting particle approximation to the forward-backward stochastic differential equations arising from Pontryagin's maximum principle with the forward stochastic differential equation provided by the time-continuous ensemble Kalman-Bucy filter equations. The receding horizon control laws are approximated as linear and are continuously updated as in nonlinear model predictive control. We illustrate the performance of the proposed methodology for an inverted pendulum example.</p></details> |  |
| **[Parameter estimation for partially observed second-order diffusion processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14738v2)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating parameters of a diffusion process given continuous-time observations of the process via maximum likelihood approaches or, online, via stochastic gradient descent or Kalman filter formulations constitutes a well-established research area. It has also been established previously that these techniques are, in general, not robust to perturbations in the data in the form of temporal correlations of the driving noise. While the subject is relatively well understood and appropriate modifications have been suggested in the context of multi-scale diffusion processes and their reduced model equations, we consider here an alternative but related setting where a diffusion process in positions and velocities is only observed via its positions. In this note, we propose a simple modification to standard stochastic gradient descent and Kalman filter formulations, which eliminates the arising systematic estimation biases. The modification can be extended to standard maximum likelihood approaches and avoids computation of previously proposed correction terms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Communication-Aware Iterative Map Compression for Online Path-Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10843v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the problem of optimizing communicated information among heterogeneous, resource-aware robot teams to facilitate their navigation. In such operations, a mobile robot compresses its local map to assist another robot in reaching a target within an uncharted environment. The primary challenge lies in ensuring that the map compression step balances network load while transmitting only the most essential information for effective navigation. We propose a communication framework that sequentially selects the optimal map compression in a task-driven, communication-aware manner. It introduces a decoder capable of iterative map estimation, handling noise through Kalman filter techniques. The computational speed of our decoder allows for a larger compression template set compared to previous methods, and enables applications in more challenging environments. Specifically, our simulations demonstrate a remarkable 98% reduction in communicated information, compared to a framework that transmits the raw data, on a large Mars inclination map and an Earth map, all while maintaining similar planning costs. Furthermore, our method significantly reduces computational time compared to the state-of-the-art approach.</p></details> | 7 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Consistent multi-animal pose estimation in cattle using dynamic Kalman filter based tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10450v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the past decade, studying animal behaviour with the help of computer vision has become more popular. Replacing human observers by computer vision lowers the cost of data collection and therefore allows to collect more extensive datasets. However, the majority of available computer vision algorithms to study animal behaviour is highly tailored towards a single research objective, limiting possibilities for data reuse. In this perspective, pose-estimation in combination with animal tracking offers opportunities to yield a higher level representation capturing both the spatial and temporal component of animal behaviour. Such a higher level representation allows to answer a wide variety of research questions simultaneously, without the need to develop repeatedly tailored computer vision algorithms. In this paper, we therefore first cope with several weaknesses of current pose-estimation algorithms and thereafter introduce KeySORT (Keypoint Simple and Online Realtime Tracking). KeySORT deploys an adaptive Kalman filter to construct tracklets in a bounding-box free manner, significantly improving the temporal consistency of detected keypoints. In this paper, we focus on pose estimation in cattle, but our methodology can easily be generalised to any other animal species. Our test results indicate our algorithm is able to detect up to 80% of the ground truth keypoints with high accuracy, with only a limited drop in performance when daylight recordings are compared to nightvision recordings. Moreover, by using KeySORT to construct skeletons, the temporal consistency of generated keypoint coordinates was largely improved, offering opportunities with regard to automated behaviour monitoring of animals.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimal Estimation for Continuous-Time Nonlinear Systems Using State-Dependent Riccati Equation (SDRE)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10442v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a unified approach for state estimation and control of nonlinear dynamic systems, employing the State-Dependent Riccati Equation (SDRE) framework. The proposed approach naturally extends classical linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) methods into nonlinear scenarios, avoiding linearization by using state-dependent coefficient (SDC) matrices. An SDRE-based Kalman filter (SDRE-KF) is integrated within an SDRE-based control structure, providing a coherent and intuitive strategy for nonlinear system analysis and control design. To evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed methodology, comparative simulations are conducted on two benchmark nonlinear systems: a simple pendulum and a Van der Pol oscillator. Results demonstrate that the SDRE-KF achieves comparable or superior estimation accuracy compared to traditional methods, including the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and Particle Filter (PF). These findings underline the potential of the unified SDRE-based approach as a viable alternative for nonlinear state estimation and control, providing valuable insights for both educational purposes and practical engineering applications.</p></details> |  |

These methods are used for state estimation of dynamic systems by relying on mathematical representations in the form of simple state-space (SS) models, which may be crude and inaccurate descriptions of the underlying dynamics. Emerging data-centric artificial intelligence (AI) techniques tackle these tasks using deep neural networks (DNNs), which are model-agnostic. Recent developments illustrate the possibility of fusing DNNs with classic Kalman-type filtering, obtaining systems that learn to track in partially known dynamics. This article provides a tutorial-style overview of design approaches for incorporating AI in aiding KF-type algorithms. We review both generic and dedicated DNN architectures suitable for state estimation, and provide a systematic presentation of techniques for fusing AI tools with KFs and for leveraging partial SS modeling and data, categorizing design approaches into task-oriented and SS model-oriented. The usefulness of each approach in preserving the individual strengths of model-based KFs and data-driven DNNs is investigated in a qualitative and quantitative study, whose code is publicly available, illustrating the gains of hybrid model-based/data-driven designs. We also discuss existing challenges and future research directions that arise from fusing AI and Kalman-type algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the IEEE Signal Processing Magazine</p></details> |

With the advancement of 3D sensors, these systems can better perceive their surroundings using effective 3D Extended Object Tracking (EOT) methods. Based on the observation that common road users are symmetrical on the right and left sides in the traveling direction, we focus on the side view profile of the object. In order to leverage of the development in 2D EOT and balance the number of parameters of a shape model in the tracking algorithms, we propose a method for 3D extended object tracking (EOT) by describing the side view profile of the object with B-spline curves and forming an extrusion to obtain a 3D extent. The use of B-spline curves exploits their flexible representation power by allowing the control points to move freely. The algorithm is developed into an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). For a through evaluation of this method, we use simulated traffic scenario of different vehicle models and realworld open dataset containing both radar and lidar data.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, submitted to FUSION 2025</p></details> |

This coupling is specifically addressed by leveraging the expectation-maximization (EM) framework. In particular, our technique will combine a moving window approach in the E-step to efficiently estimate the switching sequence, together with an extended Kalman filter (EKF) in the M-step to train the NNs with a quadratic convergence rate. Extensive numerical simulations, involving both academic examples and a battery charge management system case study, illustrate that our technique outperforms available ones in terms of parameter estimation accuracy, model fitting, and switching sequence identification.</p></details> |  |

A Deep Learning-based Adaptation Mechanism (DLAM) is proposed to adaptively tune the noise covariance matrices of Kalman-type filters for the Visual-Inertial Navigation (VIN) problem, leveraging IMU-Vision-Net. Subsequently, an adaptively tuned Deep Learning Unscented Kalman Filter for 3D VIN (DeepUKF-VIN) is introduced to utilize the proposed DLAM, thereby robustly estimating key navigation components, including orientation, position, and linear velocity. The proposed DeepUKF-VIN integrates data from onboard sensors, specifically an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and visual feature points extracted from a camera, and is applicable for GPS-denied navigation. Its quaternion-based design effectively captures navigation nonlinearities and avoids the singularities commonly encountered with Euler-angle-based filters. Implemented in discrete space, the DeepUKF-VIN facilitates practical filter deployment. The filter's performance is evaluated using real-world data collected from an IMU and a stereo camera at low sampling rates. The results demonstrate filter stability and rapid attenuation of estimation errors, highlighting its high estimation accuracy. Furthermore, comparative testing against the standard Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) in two scenarios consistently shows superior performance across all navigation components, thereby validating the efficacy and robustness of the proposed DeepUKF-VIN.

| **[Computation-Aware Kalman Filtering and Smoothing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08971v2)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Kalman filtering and smoothing are the foundational mechanisms for efficient inference in Gauss-Markov models. However, their time and memory complexities scale prohibitively with the size of the state space. This is particularly problematic in spatiotemporal regression problems, where the state dimension scales with the number of spatial observations. Existing approximate frameworks leverage low-rank approximations of the covariance matrix. But since they do not model the error introduced by the computational approximation, their predictive uncertainty estimates can be overly optimistic. In this work, we propose a probabilistic numerical method for inference in high-dimensional Gauss-Markov models which mitigates these scaling issues. Our matrix-free iterative algorithm leverages GPU acceleration and crucially enables a tunable trade-off between computational cost and predictive uncertainty. Finally, we demonstrate the scalability of our method on a large-scale climate dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Solving Functional Optimization with Deep Networks and Variational Principles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06277v4)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Can neural networks solve math problems using first a principle alone? This paper shows how to leverage the fundamental theorem of the calculus of variations to design deep neural networks to solve functional optimization without requiring training data (e.g., ground-truth optimal solutions). Our approach is particularly crucial when the solution is a function defined over an unknown interval or support\textemdash such as in minimum-time control problems. By incorporating the necessary conditions satisfied by the optimal function solution, as derived from the calculus of variation, in the design of the deep architecture, CalVNet leverages overparameterized neural networks to learn these optimal functions directly. We validate CalVNet by showing that, without relying on ground-truth data and simply incorporating first principles, it successfully derives the Kalman filter for linear filtering, the bang-bang optimal control for minimum-time problems, and finds geodesics on manifolds. Our results demonstrate that CalVNet can be trained in an unsupervised manner, without relying on ground-truth data, establishing a promising framework for addressing general, potentially unsolved functional optimization problems that still lack analytical solutions.</p></details> | 16 pages, 4 figures |

This novel integration effectively handles practical issues in machine learning such as noisy measurement data, online learning, and data efficiency. By considering any robot as a tunable optimal control system, we propose an online parameter estimator based on extended Kalman filter (EKF) to incrementally tune the system in an online fashion, enabling it to complete designated learning or control tasks. The proposed method also improves the robustness in learning by effectively managing noise in the data. Theoretical analysis is provided to demonstrate the convergence of OCIL. Three learning modes of OCIL, i.e. Online Imitation Learning, Online System Identification, and Policy Tuning On-the-fly, are investigated via experiments, which validate their effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Geometric Nonlinear Filtering with Almost Global Convergence for Attitude and Bias Estimation on the Special Orthogonal Group](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08255v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a novel geometric nonlinear filter for attitude and bias estimation on the Special Orthogonal Group $SO(3)$ using matrix measurements. The structure of the proposed filter is similar to that of the continuous-time deterministic multiplicative extended Kalman filter (MEKF). The main difference with the MEKF is the inclusion of curvature correction terms in both the filter gain and gain update equations. These terms ensure that the proposed filter, named the Generalized $SO(3)$-MEKF, renders the desired equilibrium of the estimation error system to be almost globally uniformly asymptotically stable (AGUAS). More precisely, the attitude and bias estimation errors converge uniformly asymptotically to zero for almost all initial conditions except those where the initial angular estimation error equals $\pi$ radians. Moreover, in the case of small estimation errors, the proposed generalized $SO(3)$-MEKF simplifies to the standard $SO(3)$-MEKF with matrix measurements. Simulation results indicate that the proposed filter has similar performance compared to the latter. Thus, the main advantage of the proposed filter over the MEKF is the guarantee of (almost) global uniform asymptotic stability.</p></details> |  |

For the case of linear time-varying models and non-smoothconvex regularization terms, we provide a sublinear regret bound that ensures the proper behavior of the online learning strategy. The approach is computationally efficient for a wide range of regularization terms, which makes it appealing for its use in embedded control applications for online model adaptation. We show the performance of the proposed method in three simulation examples, highlighting its effectiveness compared to other batch and online algorithms.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |

FIRs, because of their small weight and size, offer unparalleled advantages in terms of material cost and scalability. However, their size introduces considerable control challenges, notably high-speed dynamics, restricted power, and limited payload capacity. While there have been advancements in developing lightweight sensors, often drawing inspiration from biological systems, no sub-gram aircraft has been able to attain sustained hover without relying on feedback from external sensing such as a motion capture system. The lightest vehicle capable of sustained hovering -- the first level of ``sensor autonomy'' -- is the much larger 28 g Crazyflie. Previous work reported a reduction in size of that vehicle's avionics suite to 187 mg and 21 mW. Here, we report a further reduction in mass and power to only 78.4 mg and 15 mW. We replaced the laser rangefinder with a lighter and more efficient pressure sensor, and built a smaller optic flow sensor around a global-shutter imaging chip. A Kalman Filter (KF) fuses these measurements to estimate the state variables that are needed to control hover: pitch angle, translational velocity, and altitude. Our system achieved performance comparable to that of the Crazyflie's estimator while in flight, with root mean squared errors of 1.573 deg, 0.186 m/s, and 0.136 m, respectively, relative to motion capture.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICRA 2025</p></details> |

Providing valuable contextual information about the environment, the prior map is a vital tool for mitigating drift. In this paper, we propose a map-based visual-inertial localization algorithm (NeRF-VIO) with initialization using neural radiance fields (NeRF). Our algorithm utilizes a multilayer perceptron model and redefines the loss function as the geodesic distance on \(SE(3)\), ensuring the invariance of the initialization model under a frame change within \(\mathfrak{se}(3)\). The evaluation demonstrates that our model outperforms existing NeRF-based initialization solution in both accuracy and efficiency. By integrating a two-stage update mechanism within a multi-state constraint Kalman filter (MSCKF) framework, the state of NeRF-VIO is constrained by both captured images from an onboard camera and rendered images from a pre-trained NeRF model. The proposed algorithm is validated using a real-world AR dataset, the results indicate that our two-stage update pipeline outperforms MSCKF across all data sequences.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes an innovative framework that integrates advanced visual perception technologies, real-time ergonomic monitoring, and Behaviour Tree (BT)-based adaptive decision-making. Unlike traditional methods, which often operate in isolation or statically, our approach combines deep learning models (YOLO11 and SlowOnly), advanced tracking (Unscented Kalman Filter) and dynamic ergonomic assessments (OWAS), offering a modular, scalable and adaptive system. Experimental results show that the framework outperforms previous methods in several aspects: accuracy in detecting postures and actions, adaptivity in managing human-robot interactions, and ability to reduce ergonomic risk through timely robotic interventions. In particular, the visual perception module showed superiority over YOLOv9 and YOLOv8, while real-time ergonomic monitoring eliminated the limitations of static analysis. Adaptive role management, made possible by the Behaviour Tree, provided greater responsiveness than rule-based systems, making the framework suitable for complex industrial scenarios. Our system demonstrated a 92.5\% accuracy in grasping intention recognition and successfully classified ergonomic risks with real-time responsiveness (average latency of 0.57 seconds), enabling timely robotic</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pagine, 10 figure, 3 tabelle, formato conferenza IEEE</p></details> |
| **[Split Covariance Intersection Filter Based Visual Localization With Accurate AprilTag Map For Warehouse Robot Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17879v2)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and efficient localization with conveniently-established map is the fundamental requirement for mobile robot operation in warehouse environments. An accurate AprilTag map can be conveniently established with the help of LiDAR-based SLAM. It is true that a LiDAR-based system is usually not commercially competitive in contrast with a vision-based system, yet fortunately for warehouse applications, only a single LiDAR-based SLAM system is needed to establish an accurate AprilTag map, whereas a large amount of visual localization systems can share this established AprilTag map for their own operations. Therefore, the cost of a LiDAR-based SLAM system is actually shared by the large amount of visual localization systems, and turns to be acceptable and even negligible for practical warehouse applications. Once an accurate AprilTag map is available, visual localization is realized as recursive estimation that fuses AprilTag measurements (i.e. AprilTag detection results) and robot motion data. AprilTag measurements may be nonlinear partial measurements; this can be handled by the well-known extended Kalman filter (EKF) in the spirit of local linearization. AprilTag measurements tend to have temporal correlation as well; however, this cannot be reasonably handled by the EKF. The split covariance intersection filter (Split CIF) is adopted to handle temporal correlation among AprilTag measurements. The Split CIF (in the spirit of local linearization) can also handle AprilTag nonlinear partial measurements. The Split CIF based visual localization system incorporates a measurement adaptive mechanism to handle outliers in AprilTag measurements and adopts a dynamic initialization mechanism to address the kidnapping problem. A comparative study in real warehouse environments demonstrates the potential and advantage of the Split CIF based visual localization solution.</p></details> |  |

Therefore, we propose an Adaptive Kalman Filter (AKF) framework that dynamically estimates time-varying noise covariances of LiDAR and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) measurements, enabling context-aware confidence weighting between sensors. During LiDAR degeneracy, the system prioritizes IMU data while suppressing contributions from unreliable inputs like moving objects or noisy point clouds. Furthermore, a compact Gaussian-based map representation is introduced to model environmental planarity and spatial noise. A correlated registration strategy ensures accurate plane normal estimation via pseudo-merge, even in unstructured environments like forests. Extensive experiments validate the robustness of the proposed system across diverse environments, including dynamic scenes and geometrically degraded scenarios. Our method achieves reliable localization results across all MARS-LVIG sequences and ranks 8th on the KITTI Odometry Benchmark.

| **[Recursive Estimation for Dynamical Systems with Measurement Bias, Outliers and Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06825v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper describes recursive algorithms for state estimation of linear dynamical systems when measurements are noisy with unknown bias and/or outliers. For situations with noisy and biased measurements, algorithms are proposed that minimize $\epsilon$ insensitive loss function. In this approach which is often used in Support Vector Machines, small errors are ignored making the algorithm less sensitive to measurement bias. Apart from $\epsilon$ insensitive quadratic loss function, estimation algorithms are also presented for $\epsilon$ insensitive Huber M loss function which provides good performance in presence of both small noises as well as outliers. The advantage of Huber cost function based estimator in presence of outliers is due to the fact the error penalty function switches from quadratic to linear for errors beyond a certain threshold. For both objective functions, estimation algorithms are extended to cases when there are additional constraints on states and exogenous signals such as known range of some states or exogenous signals or measurement noises. Interestingly, the filtering algorithms are recursive and structurally similar to Kalman filter with the main difference being that the updates based on the new measurement ("innovation term") are based on solution of a quadratic optimization problem with linear constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian Optimization for Robust Identification of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06381v1)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper deals with the identification of the stochastic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process error model, which is characterized by an inverse time constant, and the unknown variances of the process and observation noises. Although the availability of the explicit expression of the log-likelihood function allows one to obtain the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE), this entails evaluating the nontrivial gradient and also often struggles with local optima. To address these limitations, we put forth a sample-efficient global optimization approach based on the Bayesian optimization (BO) framework, which relies on a Gaussian process (GP) surrogate model for the objective function that effectively balances exploration and exploitation to select the query points. Specifically, each evaluation of the objective is implemented efficiently through the Kalman filter (KF) recursion. Comprehensive experiments on various parameter settings and sampling intervals corroborate that BO-based estimator consistently outperforms MLE implemented by the steady-state KF approximation and the expectation-maximization algorithm (whose derivation is a side contribution) in terms of root mean-square error (RMSE) and statistical consistency, confirming the effectiveness and robustness of the BO for identification of the stochastic OU process. Notably, the RMSE values produced by the BO-based estimator are smaller than the classical Cram\'{e}r-Rao lower bound, especially for the inverse time constant, estimating which has been a long-standing challenge. This seemingly counterintuitive result can be explained by the data-driven prior for the learning parameters indirectly injected by BO through the GP prior over the objective function.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Kalman-Informed Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09987v2)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The extended Kalman filter (EKF) is a widely adopted method for sensor fusion in navigation applications. A crucial aspect of the EKF is the online determination of the process noise covariance matrix reflecting the model uncertainty. While common EKF implementation assumes a constant process noise, in real-world scenarios, the process noise varies, leading to inaccuracies in the estimated state and potentially causing the filter to diverge. Model-based adaptive EKF methods were proposed and demonstrated performance improvements to cope with such situations, highlighting the need for a robust adaptive approach. In this paper, we derive an adaptive Kalman-informed transformer (A-KIT) designed to learn the varying process noise covariance online. Built upon the foundations of the EKF, A-KIT utilizes the well-known capabilities of set transformers, including inherent noise reduction and the ability to capture nonlinear behavior in the data. This approach is suitable for any application involving the EKF. In a case study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of A-KIT in nonlinear fusion between a Doppler velocity log and inertial sensors. This is accomplished using real data recorded from sensors mounted on an autonomous underwater vehicle operating in the Mediterranean Sea. We show that A-KIT outperforms the conventional EKF by more than 49.5% and model-based adaptive EKF by an average of 35.4% in terms of position accuracy.</p></details> |  |

To this end, we devised ProcessNet, a simple yet efficient end-to-end regression network to adaptively estimate the process noise covariance matrix.

The coefficient transform method for the conversion is stated for both Ito's and Stratonovich's interpretation of the SDE. Then we derive a mean and covariance fitting formula for probability distributions on Lie groups defined by a concentrated distribution on the exponential coordinate. It is used to derive the mean and covariance propagation equations for the SDE defined by injection, which coincides with the result derived from a Fokker-Planck equation in previous work. We also propose a simple modification to the update step of Kalman filters using the fitting formula, which improves the fusion accuracy with moderate computation time.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CDC 2024; modified typos in theorem 2 and appendix A</p></details> |

However, the filter-based method has the problem of insufficient accuracy. To this end, we propose the State transformation and Pose-only VIO (SP-VIO) by rebuilding the state and measurement models, and considering further visual deprived conditions. In detail, we first proposed the double state transformation extended Kalman filter (DST-EKF) to replace the standard extended Kalman filter (Std-EKF) for improving the system's consistency, and then adopt pose-only (PO) visual description to avoid the linearization error caused by 3D feature estimation. The comprehensive observability analysis shows that SP-VIO has a more stable unobservable subspace, which can better avoid the inconsistency problem caused by spurious information. Moreover, we propose an enhanced double state transformation Rauch-Tung-Striebel (DST-RTS) backtracking method to optimize motion trajectories during visual interruption. Monte-Carlo simulations and real-world experiments show that SP-VIO has better accuracy and efficiency than state-of-the-art (SOTA) VIO algorithms, and has better robustness under visual deprived conditions.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose DogLegs, a state estimation system for legged robots that fuses the measurements from a body-mounted inertial measurement unit (Body-IMU), joint encoders, and multiple leg-mounted IMUs (Leg-IMU) using an extended Kalman filter (EKF). The filter system contains the error states of all IMU frames. The Leg-IMUs are used to detect foot contact, thereby providing zero velocity measurements to update the state of the Leg-IMU frames. Additionally, we compute the relative position constraints between the Body-IMU and Leg-IMUs by the leg kinematics and use them to update the main body state and reduce the error drift of the individual IMU frames. Field experimental results have shown that our proposed system can achieve better state estimation accuracy compared to the traditional leg odometry method (using only Body-IMU and joint encoders) across different terrains. We make our datasets publicly available to benefit the research community.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |

Most tracking systems have limitations such as constraining all movement to a 2D plane and they often track only one object. In this paper, we present a new modular pipeline that calculates 3D trajectories of multiple objects. It is adaptable to various settings where multiple time-synced and stationary cameras record moving objects, using off the shelf webcams. Our pipeline was tested on the Table Setting Dataset, where participants are recorded with various sensors as they set a table with tableware objects. We need to track these manipulated objects, using 6 rgb webcams. Challenges include: Detecting small objects in 9.874.699 camera frames, determining camera poses, discriminating between nearby and overlapping objects, temporary occlusions, and finally calculating a 3D trajectory using the right subset of an average of 11.12.456 pixel coordinates per 3-minute trial. We implement a robust pipeline that results in accurate trajectories with covariance of x,y,z-position as a confidence metric. It deals dynamically with appearing and disappearing objects, instantiating new Extended Kalman Filters. It scales to hundreds of table-setting trials with very little human annotation input, even with the camera poses of each trial unknown.

| **[Tensegrity Robot Proprioceptive State Estimation with Geometric Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24226v2)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tensegrity robots, characterized by a synergistic assembly of rigid rods and elastic cables, form robust structures that are resistant to impacts. However, this design introduces complexities in kinematics and dynamics, complicating control and state estimation. This work presents a novel proprioceptive state estimator for tensegrity robots. The estimator initially uses the geometric constraints of 3-bar prism tensegrity structures, combined with IMU and motor encoder measurements, to reconstruct the robot's shape and orientation. It then employs a contact-aided invariant extended Kalman filter with forward kinematics to estimate the global position and orientation of the tensegrity robot. The state estimator's accuracy is assessed against ground truth data in both simulated environments and real-world tensegrity robot applications. It achieves an average drift percentage of 4.2%, comparable to the state estimation performance of traditional rigid robots. This state estimator advances the state of the art in tensegrity robot state estimation and has the potential to run in real-time using onboard sensors, paving the way for full autonomy of tensegrity robots in unstructured environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint; 8 pages, 12 figures, 2 tables; Code at https://github.com/Jonathan-Twz/tensegrity-robot-state-estimator</p></details> |

However, 4D Flow MRI has a very long acquisition time, straining healthcare resources and inconveniencing patients. Due to this, usually only a part of the frequency space is acquired, where then further assumptions need to be made in order to obtain an image. Inverse problems from 4D Flow MRI data have the potential to compute clinically relevant quantities without the need for invasive procedures, and/or expanding the set of biomarkers for a more accurate diagnosis. However, reconstructing MRI measurements with Compressed Sensing techniques introduces artifacts and inaccuracies, which can compromise the results of the inverse problems. Additionally, there is a high number of different sampling patterns available, and it is often unclear which of them is preferable. Here, we present a parameter estimation problem directly using highly undersampled frequency space measurements. This problem is numerically solved by a Reduced-Order Unscented Kalman Filter (ROUKF). We show that this results in more accurate parameter estimation for boundary conditions in a synthetic aortic blood flow than using measurements reconstructed with Compressed Sensing. We also compare different sampling patterns, demonstrating how the quality of the parameter estimation depends on the choice of the sampling pattern. The results show a considerably higher accuracy than an inverse problem using velocity measurements reconstructed via compressed sensing. Finally, we confirm these findings on real MRI data from a mechanical phantom.</p></details> |  |
| **[Closed-loop model-predictive wind farm flow control under time-varying inflow using FLORIDyn](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02790v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Wind farm flow control has been a key research focus in recent years, driven by the idea that a collectively operating wind farm can outperform individually controlled turbines. Control strategies are predominantly applied in an open-loop manner, where the current flow conditions are used to look up precomputed steady-state set points. Closed-loop control approaches, on the other hand, take measurements from the farm into account and optimize their set points online, which makes them more flexible and resilient. This paper introduces a closed-loop model-predictive wind farm controller using the dynamic engineering model FLORIDyn to maximize the energy generated by a ten-turbine wind farm. The framework consists of an Ensemble Kalman Filter to continuously correct the flow field estimate, as well as a novel optimization strategy. To this end the paper discusses two dynamic ways to maximize the farm energy and compares this to the current look-up table industry standard. The framework relies solely on turbine measurements without using a flow field preview. In a 3-hour case study with time-varying conditions, the derived controllers achieve an overall energy gain of 3 to 4.4 % with noise-free wind direction measurements. If disturbed and biased measurements are used, this performance decreases to 1.9 to 3 % over the greedy control baseline with the same measurements. The comparison to look-up table controllers shows that the closed-loop framework performance is more robust to disturbed measurements but can only match the performance in noise-free conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Weakly-Constrained 4D Var for Downscaling with Uncertainty using Data-Driven Surrogate Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02665v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic downscaling typically involves using numerical weather prediction (NWP) solvers to refine coarse data to higher spatial resolutions. Data-driven models such as FourCastNet have emerged as a promising alternative to the traditional NWP models for forecasting. Once these models are trained, they are capable of delivering forecasts in a few seconds, thousands of times faster compared to classical NWP models. However, as the lead times, and, therefore, their forecast window, increase, these models show instability in that they tend to diverge from reality. In this paper, we propose to use data assimilation approaches to stabilize them when used for downscaling tasks. Data assimilation uses information from three different sources, namely an imperfect computational model based on partial differential equations (PDE), from noisy observations, and from an uncertainty-reflecting prior. In this work, when carrying out dynamic downscaling, we replace the computationally expensive PDE-based NWP models with FourCastNet in a ``weak-constrained 4DVar framework" that accounts for the implied model errors. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach for a hurricane-tracking problem; moreover, the 4DVar framework naturally allows the expression and quantification of uncertainty. We demonstrate, using ERA5 data, that our approach performs better than the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) and the unstabilized FourCastNet model, both in terms of forecast accuracy and forecast uncertainty.</p></details> |  |
| **[Equivariant Filter for Tightly Coupled LiDAR-Inertial Odometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06948v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pose estimation is a crucial problem in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). However, developing a robust and consistent state estimator remains a significant challenge, as the traditional extended Kalman filter (EKF) struggles to handle the model nonlinearity, especially for inertial measurement unit (IMU) and light detection and ranging (LiDAR). To provide a consistent and efficient solution of pose estimation, we propose Eq-LIO, a robust state estimator for tightly coupled LIO systems based on an equivariant filter (EqF). Compared with the invariant Kalman filter based on the $\SE_2(3)$ group structure, the EqF uses the symmetry of the semi-direct product group to couple the system state including IMU bias, navigation state and LiDAR extrinsic calibration state, thereby suppressing linearization error and improving the behavior of the estimator in the event of unexpected state changes. The proposed Eq-LIO owns natural consistency and higher robustness, which is theoretically proven with mathematical derivation and experimentally verified through a series of tests on both public and private datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICRA 2025</p></details> |
| **[Zero-Shot Sim-to-Real Visual Quadrotor Control with Hard Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02198v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present the first framework demonstrating zero-shot sim-to-real transfer of visual control policies learned in a Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) environment for quadrotors to fly through racing gates. Robust transfer from simulation to real flight poses a major challenge, as standard simulators often lack sufficient visual fidelity. To address this, we construct a photorealistic simulation environment of quadrotor racing tracks, called FalconGym, which provides effectively unlimited synthetic images for training. Within FalconGym, we develop a pipelined approach for crossing gates that combines (i) a Neural Pose Estimator (NPE) coupled with a Kalman filter to reliably infer quadrotor poses from single-frame RGB images and IMU data, and (ii) a self-attention-based multi-modal controller that adaptively integrates visual features and pose estimation. This multi-modal design compensates for perception noise and intermittent gate visibility. We train this controller purely in FalconGym with imitation learning and deploy the resulting policy to real hardware with no additional fine-tuning. Simulation experiments on three distinct tracks (circle, U-turn and figure-8) demonstrate that our controller outperforms a vision-only state-of-the-art baseline in both success rate and gate-crossing accuracy. In 30 live hardware flights spanning three tracks and 120 gates, our controller achieves a 95.8% success rate and an average error of just 10 cm when flying through 38 cm-radius gates.</p></details> |  |

While Particle Gibbs (also known as conditional sequential Monte Carlo) is considered the gold standard for this task, it quickly degrades in performance as the latent space dimensionality increases. Conversely, globally Gaussian-approximated methods like extended Kalman filtering, though more robust, are seldom used for posterior sampling due to their inherent bias. We introduce novel auxiliary sampling approaches that address these limitations. By incorporating artificial observations of the system as auxiliary variables in our MCMC kernels, we develop both efficient exact Kalman-based samplers and enhanced Particle Gibbs algorithms that maintain performance in high-dimensional latent spaces. Some of our methods support parallelisation along the time dimension, achieving logarithmic scaling when implemented on GPUs. Empirical evaluations demonstrate superior statistical and computational performance compared to existing approaches for high-dimensional latent dynamical systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the Electronic Journal of Statistics. 33 pages (incl. references and TOC) + 10 pages appendix, 10 figures.

| **[Dynamics on Lie groups with applications to attitude estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19714v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The problem of filtering - propagation of states through stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and association of measurement data using Bayesian inference - in a state space which forms a Lie group is considered. Particular emphasis is given to concentrated Gaussians (CGs) as a parametric family of probability distributions to capture the uncertainty associated with an estimated state. The so-called group-affine property of the state evolution is shown to be necessary and sufficient for linearity of the dynamics on the associated Lie algebra, in turn implying CGs are invariant under such evolution. A putative SDE on the group is then reformulated as an SDE on the associated Lie algebra. The vector space structure of the Lie algebra together with the notion of a CG enables the leveraging of techniques from conventional Gaussian-based Kalman filtering in an approach called the tangent space filter (TSF). We provide example calculations for several Lie groups that arise in the problem of estimating position, velocity, and orientation of a rigid body from a noisy, potentially biased inertial measurement unit (IMU). For the specific problem of attitude estimation, numerical experiments demonstrate that TSF-based approaches are more accurate and robust than another widely used attitude filtering technique.</p></details> | <details><summary>51 pa...</summary><p>51 pages, 3 figures, submitted to AIAA/JGCD</p></details> |
| **[Model Predictive Inferential Control of Neural State-Space Models for Autonomous Vehicle Motion Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08045v3)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model predictive control (MPC) has proven useful in enabling safe and optimal motion planning for autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we investigate how to achieve MPC-based motion planning when a neural state-space model represents the vehicle dynamics. As the neural state-space model will lead to highly complex, nonlinear and nonconvex optimization landscapes, mainstream gradient-based MPC methods will be computationally too heavy to be a viable solution. In a departure, we propose the idea of model predictive inferential control (MPIC), which seeks to infer the best control decisions from the control objectives and constraints. Following the idea, we convert the MPC problem for motion planning into a Bayesian state estimation problem. Then, we develop a new particle filtering/smoothing approach to perform the estimation. This approach is implemented as banks of unscented Kalman filters/smoothers and offers high sampling efficiency, fast computation, and estimation accuracy. We evaluate the MPIC approach through a simulation study of autonomous driving in different scenarios, along with an exhaustive comparison with gradient-based MPC. The results show that the MPIC approach has considerable computational efficiency, regardless of complex neural network architectures, and shows the capability to solve large-scale MPC problems for neural state-space models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Legged Robot State Estimation Using Invariant Neural-Augmented Kalman Filter with a Neural Compensator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00344v1)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents an algorithm to improve state estimation for legged robots. Among existing model-based state estimation methods for legged robots, the contact-aided invariant extended Kalman filter defines the state on a Lie group to preserve invariance, thereby significantly accelerating convergence. It achieves more accurate state estimation by leveraging contact information as measurements for the update step. However, when the model exhibits strong nonlinearity, the estimation accuracy decreases. Such nonlinearities can cause initial errors to accumulate and lead to large drifts over time. To address this issue, we propose compensating for errors by augmenting the Kalman filter with an artificial neural network serving as a nonlinear function approximator. Furthermore, we design this neural network to respect the Lie group structure to ensure invariance, resulting in our proposed Invariant Neural-Augmented Kalman Filter (InNKF). The proposed algorithm offers improved state estimation performance by combining the strengths of model-based and learning-based approaches.

| **[A review of Bayesian sensor-based estimation and uncertainty quantification of aerodynamic flows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20280v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many applications in aerodynamics depend on the use of sensors to estimate the evolving state of the flow. In particular, a wide variety of traditional and learning-based strategies for closed-loop control rely on some knowledge of the aerodynamic state in order to decide on actions. This estimation task is inherently accompanied by uncertainty due to the noisy measurements of sensors or the non-uniqueness of the underlying mapping, and knowledge of this uncertainty can be as important for decision-making as that of the state itself. The tracking of uncertainty is challenged by the often-nonlinear relationship between the sensor measurements and the flow state. For example, a collection of passing vortices leaves a footprint in wall pressure sensors that depends nonlinearly on the strengths and positions of the vortices. In this paper, we will review the recent body of work on flow estimation. We will discuss the basic tools of probability, including sampling and estimation, in the powerful setting of Bayesian inference and demonstrate these tools in static flow estimation examples. We will then proceed to unsteady examples and illustrate the application of sequential estimation, and particularly, the ensemble Kalman filter. Finally, we will discuss uncertainty quantification in neural network approximations of the mappings between sensor measurements and flow states. Recent aerodynamic applications of neural networks have shown that the flow state can be encoded into a very low-dimensional latent space, and we will discuss the implications of this encoding on uncertainty.</p></details> | 58 pages, 15 figures |

| **[Non-Stationary Latent Auto-Regressive Bandits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03110v3)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For the non-stationary multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem, many existing methods allow a general mechanism for the non-stationarity, but rely on a budget for the non-stationarity that is sub-linear to the total number of time steps $T$. In many real-world settings, however, the mechanism for the non-stationarity can be modeled, but there is no budget for the non-stationarity. We instead consider the non-stationary bandit problem where the reward means change due to a latent, auto-regressive (AR) state. We develop Latent AR LinUCB (LARL), an online linear contextual bandit algorithm that does not rely on the non-stationary budget, but instead forms good predictions of reward means by implicitly predicting the latent state. The key idea is to reduce the problem to a linear dynamical system which can be solved as a linear contextual bandit. In fact, LARL approximates a steady-state Kalman filter and efficiently learns system parameters online. We provide an interpretable regret bound for LARL with respect to the level of non-stationarity in the environment. LARL achieves sub-linear regret in this setting if the noise variance of the latent state process is sufficiently small with respect to $T$. Empirically, LARL outperforms various baseline methods in this non-stationary bandit problem.</p></details> |  |

Although sophisticated 3D object detection and tracking methods have been investigated and developed thoroughly in the fields of computer vision and autonomous driving, their demands on expensive and high-accuracy sensor setups and substantial computational resources from large neural networks make them unsuitable for indoor robotics. Recently, more lightweight perception algorithms leveraging onboard cameras or LiDAR sensors have emerged as promising alternatives. However, relying on a single sensor poses significant limitations: cameras have limited fields of view and can suffer from high noise, whereas LiDAR sensors operate at lower frequencies and lack the richness of visual features. To address this limitation, we propose a dynamic obstacle detection and tracking framework that uses both onboard camera and LiDAR data to enable lightweight and accurate perception. Our proposed method expands on our previous ensemble detection approach, which integrates outputs from multiple low-accuracy but computationally efficient detectors to ensure real-time performance on the onboard computer. In this work, we propose a more robust fusion strategy that integrates both LiDAR and visual data to enhance detection accuracy further. We then utilize a tracking module that adopts feature-based object association and the Kalman filter to track and estimate detected obstacles' states. Besides, a dynamic obstacle classification algorithm is designed to robustly identify moving objects. The dataset evaluation demonstrates a better perception performance compared to benchmark methods. The physical experiments on a quadcopter robot confirms the feasibility for real-world navigation.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

By normalizing point density, we project LiDAR point clouds into BEV images, thereby enabling efficient feature extraction and matching. A lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) based feature extractor is employed to extract distinctive local and global descriptors from the BEV images. Local descriptors are used to match BEV images with FAST keypoints for reprojection error construction, while global descriptors facilitate loop closure detection. Reprojection error minimization is then integrated with point-to-plane registration within an iterated Extended Kalman Filter (iEKF). In the back-end, global descriptors are used to create a KD-tree-indexed keyframe database for accurate loop closure detection. When a loop closure is detected, Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) computes a coarse transform from BEV image matching, which serves as the initial estimate for Iterative Closest Point (ICP). The refined transform is subsequently incorporated into a factor graph along with odometry factors, improving the global consistency of localization. Extensive experiments conducted in various scenarios with different LiDAR types demonstrate that BEV-LIO(LC) outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving competitive localization accuracy.

However, unlike other legged robots, exoskeletons face specific constraints on where depth sensors can be mounted due to the presence of a human user. These constraints lead to a limited Field Of View (FOV) and greater sensor motion, making odometry particularly challenging. To address this, we propose a novel odometry algorithm that integrates proprioceptive data from the exoskeleton with point clouds from a depth camera to produce accurate elevation maps despite these limitations. Our method builds on an extended Kalman filter (EKF) to fuse kinematic and inertial measurements, while incorporating a tailored iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm to register new point clouds with the elevation map. Experimental validation with a leg exoskeleton demonstrates that our approach reduces drift and enhances the quality of elevation maps compared to a purely proprioceptive baseline, while also outperforming a more traditional point cloud map-based variant.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICRA 2025</p></details> |

However, these approaches often neglect potential enhancements in 3D detection processes, leading to high false positives (FP), missed detections (FN), and identity switches (IDS), particularly in challenging scenarios such as crowded scenes, small-object configurations, and adverse weather conditions. Furthermore, limitations in data preprocessing, association mechanisms, motion modeling, and life-cycle management hinder overall tracking robustness. To address these issues, we present Easy-Poly, a real-time, filter-based 3D MOT framework for multiple object categories. Our contributions include: (1) An Augmented Proposal Generator utilizing multi-modal data augmentation and refined SpConv operations, significantly improving mAP and NDS on nuScenes; (2) A Dynamic Track-Oriented (DTO) data association algorithm that effectively manages uncertainties and occlusions through optimal assignment and multiple hypothesis handling; (3) A Dynamic Motion Modeling (DMM) incorporating a confidence-weighted Kalman filter and adaptive noise covariances, enhancing MOTA and AMOTA in challenging conditions; and (4) An extended life-cycle management system with adjustive thresholds to reduce ID switches and false terminations. Experimental results show that Easy-Poly outperforms state-of-the-art methods such as Poly-MOT and Fast-Poly, achieving notable gains in mAP (e.g., from 63.30% to 64.96% with LargeKernel3D) and AMOTA (e.g., from 73.1% to 74.5%), while also running in real-time. These findings highlight Easy-Poly's adaptability and robustness in diverse scenarios, making it a compelling choice for autonomous driving and related 3D MOT applications.

By applying Bayesian principles of recursive inference from the state-space model and using a series of simplifications regarding the structure of the solution, we can present, in a unified framework, derivations of many adaptive filters which depend on the probabilistic model of the observational noise. In particular, under a Gaussian model, we obtain solutions well-known in the literature (such as LMS, NLMS, or Kalman filter), while using non-Gaussian noise, we obtain new families of adaptive filter. Notably, under assumption of Laplacian noise, we obtain a family of robust filters of which the signed-error algorithm is a well-known member, while other algorithms, derived effortlessly in the proposed framework, are entirely new. Numerical examples are shown to illustrate the properties and provide a better insight into the performance of the derived adaptive filters.</p></details> |  |

Especially when HD maps are used, a precise and repeatable method has to be chosen. Therefore accurate map generation but also re-localization against these maps is necessary. Due to best 3D reconstruction of the surrounding, LiDAR has become a reliable modality for localization. The latest LiDAR odometry estimation are based on iterative closest point (ICP) approaches, namely KISS-ICP and SAGE-ICP. We extend the capabilities of KISS-ICP by incorporating semantic information into the point alignment process using a generalizable approach with minimal parameter tuning. This enhancement allows us to surpass KISS-ICP in terms of absolute trajectory error (ATE), the primary metric for map accuracy. Additionally, we improve the Cartographer mapping framework to handle semantic information. Cartographer facilitates loop closure detection over larger areas, mitigating odometry drift and further enhancing ATE accuracy. By integrating semantic information into the mapping process, we enable the filtering of specific classes, such as parked vehicles, from the resulting map. This filtering improves relocalization quality by addressing temporal changes, such as vehicles being moved.</p></details> |  |

It is designed for indoor ground mobile robots that utilize laser Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), ensuring process completeness and precise mapping results. For frontier search, the local-global sampling architecture based on multiple Rapidly Exploring Random Trees (RRTs) is employed. Traversability checks during RRT expansion and global RRT pruning upon map updates eliminate unreachable frontiers, reducing potential collisions and deadlocks. Adaptive sampling density adjustments, informed by obstacle distribution, enhance exploration coverage potential. For frontier point navigation, a stepwise consistent motion strategy is adopted, wherein the robot strictly drives straight on approximately equidistant line segments in the polyline path and rotates in place at segment junctions. This simplified, decoupled motion pattern improves scan-matching stability and mitigates map drift. For process control, the framework serializes frontier point selection and navigation, avoiding oscillation caused by frequent goal changes in conventional parallelized processes. The waypoint retracing mechanism is introduced to generate repeated observations, triggering loop closure detection and backend optimization in graph-based SLAM, thereby improving map consistency and precision. Experiments in both simulation and real-world scenarios validate the effectiveness of the framework. It achieves improved mapping coverage and precision in more challenging environments compared to baseline 2D exploration algorithms. It also shows robustness in supporting resource-constrained robot platforms and maintaining mapping consistency across various LiDAR field-of-view (FoV) configurations.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 11 figures.

While research in urban environments has progressed significantly using LiDARs or cameras, applications in natural forest-like environments remain largely under-explored. Furthermore, forests present particular challenges due to high self-similarity and substantial variations in vegetation growth over time. In this work, we propose a robust LiDAR-based place recognition method for natural forests, ForestLPR. We hypothesize that a set of cross-sectional images of the forest's geometry at different heights contains the information needed to recognize revisiting a place. The cross-sectional images are represented by \ac{bev} density images of horizontal slices of the point cloud at different heights. Our approach utilizes a visual transformer as the shared backbone to produce sets of local descriptors and introduces a multi-BEV interaction module to attend to information at different heights adaptively. It is followed by an aggregation layer that produces a rotation-invariant place descriptor. We evaluated the efficacy of our method extensively on real-world data from public benchmarks as well as robotic datasets and compared it against the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. The results indicate that ForestLPR has consistently good performance on all evaluations and achieves an average increase of 7.38\% and 9.11\% on Recall@1 over the closest competitor on intra-sequence loop closure detection and inter-sequence re-localization, respectively, validating our hypothesis</p></details> | accepted by CVPR2025 |
| **[Large-Scale UWB Anchor Calibration and One-Shot Localization Using Gaussian Process](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16880v2)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ultra-wideband (UWB) is gaining popularity with devices like AirTags for precise home item localization but faces significant challenges when scaled to large environments like seaports. The main challenges are calibration and localization in obstructed conditions, which are common in logistics environments. Traditional calibration methods, dependent on line-of-sight (LoS), are slow, costly, and unreliable in seaports and warehouses, making large-scale localization a significant pain point in the industry. To overcome these challenges, we propose a UWB-LiDAR fusion-based calibration and one-shot localization framework. Our method uses Gaussian Processes to estimate anchor position from continuous-time LiDAR Inertial Odometry with sampled UWB ranges. This approach ensures accurate and reliable calibration with just one round of sampling in large-scale areas, I.e., 600x450 square meter. With the LoS issues, UWB-only localization can be problematic, even when anchor positions are known. We demonstrate that by applying a UWB-range filter, the search range for LiDAR loop closure descriptors is significantly reduced, improving both accuracy and speed. This concept can be applied to other loop closure detection methods, enabling cost-effective localization in large-scale warehouses and seaports. It significantly improves precision in challenging environments where UWB-only and LiDAR-Inertial methods fall short, as shown in the video (https://youtu.be/oY8jQKdM7lU).

Radar is emerging as a valuable sensing tool, especially in vision-obstructed environments, as it is less affected by particles than lidars or cameras. Modern 4D imaging radars provide three-dimensional geometric information and relative velocity measurements, but they bring challenges, such as a small field of view and sparse, noisy point clouds. Detecting loop closures in SLAM is critical for reducing trajectory drift and maintaining map accuracy. However, the directional nature of 4D radar data makes identifying loop closures, especially from reverse viewpoints, difficult due to limited scan overlap. This article explores using 4D radar for loop closure in SLAM, focusing on similar and opposing viewpoints. We generate submaps for a denser environment representation and use introspective measures to reject false detections in feature-degenerate environments. Our experiments show accurate loop closure detection in geometrically diverse settings for both similar and opposing viewpoints, improving trajectory estimation with up to 82 % improvement in ATE and rejecting false positives in self-similar environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication in the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation(ICRA), 2025</p></details> |

However, current Gaussian Splatting SLAM systems usually struggle with large scene representation and lack effective loop closure detection. To address these issues, we introduce NGM-SLAM, the first 3DGS based SLAM system that utilizes neural radiance field submaps for progressive scene expression, effectively integrating the strengths of neural radiance fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting. We utilize neural radiance field submaps as supervision and achieve high-quality scene expression and online loop closure adjustments through Gaussian rendering of fused submaps. Our results on multiple real-world scenes and large-scale scene datasets demonstrate that our method can achieve accurate hole filling and high-quality scene expression, supporting monocular, stereo, and RGB-D inputs, and achieving state-of-the-art scene reconstruction and tracking performance.</p></details> | 9pages, 4 figures |
| **[Balancing Accuracy and Efficiency for Large-Scale SLAM: A Minimal Subset Approach for Scalable Loop Closures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01791v2)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Typical LiDAR SLAM architectures feature a front-end for odometry estimation and a back-end for refining and optimizing the trajectory and map, commonly through loop closures. However, loop closure detection in large-scale missions presents significant computational challenges due to the need to identify, verify, and process numerous candidate pairs for pose graph optimization. Keyframe sampling bridges the front-end and back-end by selecting frames for storing and processing during global optimization. This article proposes an online keyframe sampling approach that constructs the pose graph using the most impactful keyframes for loop closure. We introduce the Minimal Subset Approach (MSA), which optimizes two key objectives: redundancy minimization and information preservation, implemented within a sliding window framework. By operating in the feature space rather than 3-D space, MSA efficiently reduces redundant keyframes while retaining essential information. In sum, evaluations on diverse public datasets show that the proposed approach outperforms naive methods in reducing false positive rates in place recognition, while delivering superior ATE and RPE in metric localization, without the need for manual parameter tuning. Additionally, MSA demonstrates efficiency and scalability by reducing memory usage and computational overhead during loop closure detection and pose graph optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 Figures, 2 Tables.

By normalizing point density, we project LiDAR point clouds into BEV images, thereby enabling efficient feature extraction and matching. A lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) based feature extractor is employed to extract distinctive local and global descriptors from the BEV images. Local descriptors are used to match BEV images with FAST keypoints for reprojection error construction, while global descriptors facilitate loop closure detection. Reprojection error minimization is then integrated with point-to-plane registration within an iterated Extended Kalman Filter (iEKF). In the back-end, global descriptors are used to create a KD-tree-indexed keyframe database for accurate loop closure detection. When a loop closure is detected, Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) computes a coarse transform from BEV image matching, which serves as the initial estimate for Iterative Closest Point (ICP). The refined transform is subsequently incorporated into a factor graph along with odometry factors, improving the global consistency of localization. Extensive experiments conducted in various scenarios with different LiDAR types demonstrate that BEV-LIO(LC) outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving competitive localization accuracy.

However, thermal imaging faces challenges like low contrast, high noise, and limited large-scale annotated datasets, restricting the use of deep learning in outdoor scenarios. We present DarkSLAM, a noval deep learning-based monocular thermal SLAM system designed for large-scale localization and reconstruction in complex lighting conditions.Our approach incorporates the Efficient Channel Attention (ECA) mechanism in visual odometry and the Selective Kernel Attention (SKA) mechanism in depth estimation to enhance pose accuracy and mitigate thermal depth degradation. Additionally, the system includes thermal depth-based loop closure detection and pose optimization, ensuring robust performance in low-texture thermal scenes. Extensive outdoor experiments demonstrate that DarkSLAM significantly outperforms existing methods like SC-Sfm-Learner and Shin et al., delivering precise localization and 3D dense mapping even in challenging nighttime environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Why Sample Space Matters: Keyframe Sampling Optimization for LiDAR-based Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02643v2)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in robotics are driving real-world autonomy for long-term and large-scale missions, where loop closures via place recognition are vital for mitigating pose estimation drift. However, achieving real-time performance remains challenging for resource-constrained mobile robots and multi-robot systems due to the computational burden of high-density sampling, which increases the complexity of comparing and verifying query samples against a growing map database. Conventional methods often retain redundant information or miss critical data by relying on fixed sampling intervals or operating in 3-D space instead of the descriptor feature space. To address these challenges, we introduce the concept of sample space and propose a novel keyframe sampling approach for LiDAR-based place recognition. Our method minimizes redundancy while preserving essential information in the hyper-dimensional descriptor space, supporting both learning-based and handcrafted descriptors. The proposed approach incorporates a sliding window optimization strategy to ensure efficient keyframe selection and real-time performance, enabling seamless integration into robotic pipelines. In sum, our approach demonstrates robust performance across diverse datasets, with the ability to adapt seamlessly from indoor to outdoor scenarios without parameter tuning, reducing loop closure detection times and memory requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 17 figures, 6 tables.

| **[LiDAR Loop Closure Detection using Semantic Graphs with Graph Attention Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19382v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a novel loop closure detection algorithm that uses graph attention neural networks to encode semantic graphs to perform place recognition and then use semantic registration to estimate the 6 DoF relative pose constraint. Our place recognition algorithm has two key modules, namely, a semantic graph encoder module and a graph comparison module. The semantic graph encoder employs graph attention networks to efficiently encode spatial, semantic and geometric information from the semantic graph of the input point cloud. We then use self-attention mechanism in both node-embedding and graph-embedding steps to create distinctive graph vectors. The graph vectors of the current scan and a keyframe scan are then compared in the graph comparison module to identify a possible loop closure. Specifically, employing the difference of the two graph vectors showed a significant improvement in performance, as shown in ablation studies. Lastly, we implemented a semantic registration algorithm that takes in loop closure candidate scans and estimates the relative 6 DoF pose constraint for the LiDAR SLAM system. Extensive evaluation on public datasets shows that our model is more accurate and robust, achieving 13% improvement in maximum F1 score on the SemanticKITTI dataset, when compared to the baseline semantic graph algorithm. For the benefit of the community, we open-source the complete implementation of our proposed algorithm and custom implementation of semantic registration at https://github.com/crepuscularlight/SemanticLoopClosure</p></details> |  |

The framework comprises four main components: VIO Front End, 2D Gaussian Map, NVS Loop Closure, and Dynamic Eraser. In the VIO Front End, RGB frames are processed through dense bundle adjustment and uncertainty estimation to extract scene geometry and poses. Based on this output, the mapping module incrementally constructs and maintains a 2D Gaussian map. Key components of the 2D Gaussian Map include a Sample-based Rasterizer, Score Manager, and Pose Refinement, which collectively improve mapping speed and localization accuracy. This enables the SLAM system to handle large-scale urban environments with up to 50 million Gaussian ellipsoids. To ensure global consistency in large-scale scenes, we design a Loop Closure module, which innovatively leverages the Novel View Synthesis (NVS) capabilities of Gaussian Splatting for loop closure detection and correction of the Gaussian map. Additionally, we propose a Dynamic Eraser to address the inevitable presence of dynamic objects in real-world outdoor scenes. Extensive evaluations in indoor and outdoor environments demonstrate that our approach achieves localization performance on par with Visual-Inertial Odometry while surpassing recent GS/NeRF SLAM methods. It also significantly outperforms all existing methods in terms of mapping and rendering quality. Furthermore, we developed a mobile app and verified that our framework can generate high-quality Gaussian maps in real time using only a smartphone camera and a low-frequency IMU sensor. To the best of our knowledge, VINGS-Mono is the first monocular Gaussian SLAM method capable of operating in outdoor environments and supporting kilometer-scale large scenes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficiently Closing Loops in LiDAR-Based SLAM Using Point Cloud Density Maps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07399v1)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Consistent maps are key for most autonomous mobile robots. They often use SLAM approaches to build such maps. Loop closures via place recognition help maintain accurate pose estimates by mitigating global drift. This paper presents a robust loop closure detection pipeline for outdoor SLAM with LiDAR-equipped robots. The method handles various LiDAR sensors with different scanning patterns, field of views and resolutions. It generates local maps from LiDAR scans and aligns them using a ground alignment module to handle both planar and non-planar motion of the LiDAR, ensuring applicability across platforms. The method uses density-preserving bird's eye view projections of these local maps and extracts ORB feature descriptors from them for place recognition. It stores the feature descriptors in a binary search tree for efficient retrieval, and self-similarity pruning addresses perceptual aliasing in repetitive environments. Extensive experiments on public and self-recorded datasets demonstrate accurate loop closure detection, long-term localization, and cross-platform multi-map alignment, agnostic to the LiDAR scanning patterns, fields of view, and motion profiles.</p></details> |  |

The framework integrates a data-driven front-end for instance segmentation from either RGBD cameras or LiDARs and a custom back-end for optimizing robot trajectories and object landmarks in the map. To allow multiple robots to merge their information, we design semantics-driven place recognition algorithms that leverage the informativeness and viewpoint invariance of the object-level metric-semantic map for inter-robot loop closure detection. A communication module is designed to track each robot's observations and those of other robots whenever communication links are available. Our framework enables real-time decentralized operations onboard robots, allowing them to leverage communication opportunistically. We integrate the proposed framework with the autonomous navigation and exploration systems of three types of aerial and ground robots, conducting extensive experiments in a variety of indoor and outdoor environments. These experiments demonstrate its accuracy in inter-robot localization and object mapping, along with its moderate demands on computation, storage, and communication resources. The framework is open-sourced and is suitable for both single-agent and multi-robot metric-semantic SLAM applications.

| **[SGLC: Semantic Graph-Guided Coarse-Fine-Refine Full Loop Closing for LiDAR SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08106v2)** | 2024-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Loop closing is a crucial component in SLAM that helps eliminate accumulated errors through two main steps: loop detection and loop pose correction. The first step determines whether loop closing should be performed, while the second estimates the 6-DoF pose to correct odometry drift. Current methods mostly focus on developing robust descriptors for loop closure detection, often neglecting loop pose estimation. A few methods that do include pose estimation either suffer from low accuracy or incur high computational costs. To tackle this problem, we introduce SGLC, a real-time semantic graph-guided full loop closing method, with robust loop closure detection and 6-DoF pose estimation capabilities. SGLC takes into account the distinct characteristics of foreground and background points. For foreground instances, it builds a semantic graph that not only abstracts point cloud representation for fast descriptor generation and matching but also guides the subsequent loop verification and initial pose estimation. Background points, meanwhile, are exploited to provide more geometric features for scan-wise descriptor construction and stable planar information for further pose refinement. Loop pose estimation employs a \mbox{coarse-fine-refine} registration scheme that considers the alignment of both instance points and background points, offering high efficiency and accuracy. Extensive experiments on multiple publicly available datasets demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we integrate SGLC into a SLAM system, eliminating accumulated errors and improving overall SLAM performance. The implementation of SGLC will be released at https://github.com/nubot-nudt/SGLC.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

High accuracy and robustness are essential for the long-term and stable localization capabilities of SLAM systems. Addressing the challenges of enhancing robustness and accuracy in visual-inertial SLAM, this paper propose SuperVINS, a real-time visual-inertial SLAM framework designed for challenging imaging conditions. In contrast to geometric modeling, deep learning features are capable of fully leveraging the implicit information present in images, which is often not captured by geometric features. Therefore, SuperVINS, developed as an enhancement of VINS-Fusion, integrates the deep learning neural network model SuperPoint for feature point extraction and loop closure detection. At the same time, a deep learning neural network LightGlue model for associating feature points is integrated in front-end feature matching. A feature matching enhancement strategy based on the RANSAC algorithm is proposed. The system is allowed to set different masks and RANSAC thresholds for various environments, thereby balancing computational cost and localization accuracy. Additionally, it allows for flexible training of specific SuperPoint bag of words tailored for loop closure detection in particular environments. The system enables real-time localization and mapping. Experimental validation on the well-known EuRoC dataset demonstrates that SuperVINS is comparable to other visual-inertial SLAM system in accuracy and robustness across the most challenging sequences. This paper analyzes the advantages of SuperVINS in terms of accuracy, real-time performance, and robustness. To facilitate knowledge exchange within the field, we have made the code for this paper publicly available.</p></details> |  |

The system consists of five modules: initialization, odometry, local mapping, loop closure, and global mapping, all employing the same map representation, an adaptive voxel map. The initialization provides an accurate initial state estimation and a consistent local map for subsequent modules, enabling the system to start with a highly dynamic initial state. The odometry, exploiting the short-term data association, rapidly estimates current states and detects potential system divergence. The local mapping, exploiting the mid-term data association, employs a local LiDAR-inertial bundle adjustment (BA) to refine the states (and the local map) within a sliding window of recent LiDAR scans. The loop closure detects previously visited places in the current and all previous sessions. The global mapping refines the global map with an efficient hierarchical global BA. The loop closure and global mapping both exploit long-term and multi-map data associations. We conducted a comprehensive benchmark comparison with other state-of-the-art methods across 30 sequences from three representative scenes, including narrow indoor environments using hand-held equipment, large-scale wilderness environments with aerial robots, and urban environments on vehicle platforms. Other experiments demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of the initialization, the capacity to work in multiple sessions, and relocalization in degenerated environments.</p></details> |  |

Current SLAM systems can achieve centimeter-level accuracy within a short period. However, there are still several challenges when dealing with largescale mapping tasks including significant storage requirements and difficulty of reusing the constructed maps. To address this, we first design an elastic and lightweight map representation called CELLmap, composed of several CELLs, each representing the local map at the corresponding location. Then, we design a general backend including CELL-based bidirectional registration module and loop closure detection module to improve global map consistency. Our experiments have demonstrated that CELLmap can represent the precise geometric structure of large-scale maps of KITTI dataset using only about 60 MB. Additionally, our general backend achieves up to a 26.88% improvement over various LiDAR odometry methods.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Open-Set Semantic Uncertainty Aware Metric-Semantic Graph Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11555v1)** | 2024-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Underwater object-level mapping requires incorporating visual foundation models to handle the uncommon and often previously unseen object classes encountered in marine scenarios. In this work, a metric of semantic uncertainty for open-set object detections produced by visual foundation models is calculated and then incorporated into an object-level uncertainty tracking framework. Object-level uncertainties and geometric relationships between objects are used to enable robust object-level loop closure detection for unknown object classes. The above loop closure detection problem is formulated as a graph-matching problem. While graph matching, in general, is NP-Complete, a solver for an equivalent formulation of the proposed graph matching problem as a graph editing problem is tested on multiple challenging underwater scenes. Results for this solver as well as three other solvers demonstrate that the proposed methods are feasible for real-time use in marine environments for the robust, open-set, multi-object, semantic-uncertainty-aware loop closure detection. Further experimental results on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that the method generalizes to large-scale terrestrial scenes.</p></details> |  |

This approach boils down to sequential loop-closure detection and decision-making, based on the current pose state estimate and the magnetic field. We combine this setup with a path estimation framework using an extended Kalman smoother which fuses the odometry increments with the detected loop-closure timings.

It uses lightweight convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on Bird's Eye View (BEV) image-like representations of LiDAR data to achieve accurate global localization through place recognition followed by 3-DoF pose estimation. Our detailed analyses reveal an interesting fact that CNNs are inherently effective at extracting distinctive features from LiDAR BEV images. Remarkably, keypoints of two BEV images with large translations can be effectively matched using CNN-extracted features. Building on this insight, we design a rotation equivariant module (REM) to obtain distinctive features while enhancing robustness to rotational changes. A Rotation Equivariant and Invariant Network (REIN) is then developed by cascading REM and a descriptor generator, NetVLAD, to sequentially generate rotation equivariant local features and rotation invariant global descriptors. The global descriptors are used first to achieve robust place recognition, and the local features are used for accurate pose estimation. Experimental results on multiple public datasets demonstrate that BEVPlace++, even when trained on a small dataset (3000 frames of KITTI) only with place labels, generalizes well to unseen environments, performs consistently across different days and years, and adapts to various types of LiDAR scanners. BEVPlace++ achieves state-of-the-art performance in subtasks of global localization including place recognition, loop closure detection, and global localization. Additionally, BEVPlace++ is lightweight, runs in real-time, and does not require accurate pose supervision, making it highly convenient for deployment. The source codes are publicly available at https://github.com/zjuluolun/BEVPlace.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Active Loop Closure for OSM-guided Robotic Mapping in Large-Scale Urban Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17078v1)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The autonomous mapping of large-scale urban scenes presents significant challenges for autonomous robots. To mitigate the challenges, global planning, such as utilizing prior GPS trajectories from OpenStreetMap (OSM), is often used to guide the autonomous navigation of robots for mapping. However, due to factors like complex terrain, unexpected body movement, and sensor noise, the uncertainty of the robot's pose estimates inevitably increases over time, ultimately leading to the failure of robotic mapping. To address this issue, we propose a novel active loop closure procedure, enabling the robot to actively re-plan the previously planned GPS trajectory. The method can guide the robot to re-visit the previous places where the loop-closure detection can be performed to trigger the back-end optimization, effectively reducing errors and uncertainties in pose estimation. The proposed active loop closure mechanism is implemented and embedded into a real-time OSM-guided robot mapping framework. Empirical results on several large-scale outdoor scenarios demonstrate its effectiveness and promising performance.</p></details> |  |

| **[Appearance-Based Loop Closure Detection for Online Large-Scale and Long-Term Operation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15304v1)** | 2024-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In appearance-based localization and mapping, loop closure detection is the process used to determinate if the current observation comes from a previously visited location or a new one. As the size of the internal map increases, so does the time required to compare new observations with all stored locations, eventually limiting online processing. This paper presents an online loop closure detection approach for large-scale and long-term operation. The approach is based on a memory management method, which limits the number of locations used for loop closure detection so that the computation time remains under real-time constraints. The idea consists of keeping the most recent and frequently observed locations in a Working Memory (WM) used for loop closure detection, and transferring the others into a Long-Term Memory (LTM). When a match is found between the current location and one stored in WM, associated locations stored in LTM can be updated and remembered for additional loop closure detections. Results demonstrate the approach's adaptability and scalability using ten standard data sets from other appearance-based loop closure approaches, one custom data set using real images taken over a 2 km loop of our university campus, and one custom data set (7 hours) using virtual images from the racing video game ``Need for Speed: Most Wanted''.</p></details> | 12 pages, 11 figures |
| **[GV-Bench: Benchmarking Local Feature Matching for Geometric Verification of Long-term Loop Closure Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11736v2)** | 2024-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual loop closure detection is an important module in visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), which associates current camera observation with previously visited places. Loop closures correct drifts in trajectory estimation to build a globally consistent map. However, a false loop closure can be fatal, so verification is required as an additional step to ensure robustness by rejecting the false positive loops. Geometric verification has been a well-acknowledged solution that leverages spatial clues provided by local feature matching to find true positives. Existing feature matching methods focus on homography and pose estimation in long-term visual localization, lacking references for geometric verification. To fill the gap, this paper proposes a unified benchmark targeting geometric verification of loop closure detection under long-term conditional variations. Furthermore, we evaluate six representative local feature matching methods (handcrafted and learning-based) under the benchmark, with in-depth analysis for limitations and future directions.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 11 figures, Accepted by IROS(2024)</p></details> |

Although deep learning-based local features excel at capturing high-level information and perform well on matching benchmarks, they struggle with generalization in continuous motion scenes, adversely affecting loop detection accuracy. Our system employs a Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) strategy to optimize the training of keypoint extraction networks, enhancing their adaptability to diverse environments. Additionally, we introduce a coarse-to-fine feature tracking mechanism for learned keypoints. It begins with a direct method to approximate the relative pose between consecutive frames, followed by a feature matching method for refined pose estimation. To mitigate cumulative positioning errors, DK-SLAM incorporates a novel online learning module that utilizes binary features for loop closure detection. This module dynamically identifies loop nodes within a sequence, ensuring accurate and efficient localization. Experimental evaluations on publicly available datasets demonstrate that DK-SLAM outperforms leading traditional and learning based SLAM systems, such as ORB-SLAM3 and LIFT-SLAM. These results underscore the efficacy and robustness of our DK-SLAM in varied and challenging real-world environments.</p></details> | In submission |
| **[CCTNet: A Circular Convolutional Transformer Network for LiDAR-based Place Recognition Handling Movable Objects Occlusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10793v2)** | 2024-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Place recognition is a fundamental task for robotic application, allowing robots to perform loop closure detection within simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), and achieve relocalization on prior maps. Current range image-based networks use single-column convolution to maintain feature invariance to shifts in image columns caused by LiDAR viewpoint change.However, this raises the issues such as "restricted receptive fields" and "excessive focus on local regions", degrading the performance of networks. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a lightweight circular convolutional Transformer network denoted as CCTNet, which boosts performance by capturing structural information in point clouds and facilitating crossdimensional interaction of spatial and channel information. Initially, a Circular Convolution Module (CCM) is introduced, expanding the network's perceptual field while maintaining feature consistency across varying LiDAR perspectives. Then, a Range Transformer Module (RTM) is proposed, which enhances place recognition accuracy in scenarios with movable objects by employing a combination of channel and spatial attention mechanisms. Furthermore, we propose an Overlap-based loss function, transforming the place recognition task from a binary loop closure classification into a regression problem linked to the overlap between LiDAR frames. Through extensive experiments on the KITTI and Ford Campus datasets, CCTNet surpasses comparable methods, achieving Recall@1 of 0.924 and 0.965, and Recall@1% of 0.990 and 0.993 on the test set, showcasing a superior performance. Results on the selfcollected dataset further demonstrate the proposed method's potential for practical implementation in complex scenarios to handle movable objects, showing improved generalization in various datasets.</p></details> |  |

It is also crucial in tasks such as loop closure detection and global localization within SLAM. Previous methods utilize mundane point cloud representations as input and deep learning-based LiDAR-based Place Recognition (LPR) approaches employing different point cloud image inputs with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or transformer architectures. However, the recently proposed Mamba deep learning model, combined with state space models (SSMs), holds great potential for long sequence modeling. Therefore, we developed OverlapMamba, a novel network for place recognition, which represents input range views (RVs) as sequences. In a novel way, we employ a stochastic reconstruction approach to build shift state space models, compressing the visual representation. Evaluated on three different public datasets, our method effectively detects loop closures, showing robustness even when traversing previously visited locations from different directions. Relying on raw range view inputs, it outperforms typical LiDAR and multi-view combination methods in time complexity and speed, indicating strong place recognition capabilities and real-time efficiency.</p></details> |  |

However, the utilization of 2D LiDAR in Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) frequently encounters challenges related to motion degeneracy, particularly in geometrically similar environments. To address this problem, this paper proposes a robust, accurate, and multi-sensor-fused 2D LiDAR SLAM system specifically designed for indoor mobile robots. To commence, the original LiDAR data undergoes meticulous processing through point and line extraction. Leveraging the distinctive characteristics of indoor environments, line-line constraints are established to complement other sensor data effectively, thereby augmenting the overall robustness and precision of the system. Concurrently, a tightly-coupled front-end is created, integrating data from the 2D LiDAR, IMU, and wheel odometry, thus enabling real-time state estimation. Building upon this solid foundation, a novel global feature point matching-based loop closure detection algorithm is proposed. This algorithm proves highly effective in mitigating front-end accumulated errors and ultimately constructs a globally consistent map. The experimental results indicate that our system fully meets real-time requirements. When compared to Cartographer, our system not only exhibits lower trajectory errors but also demonstrates stronger robustness, particularly in degeneracy problem.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by Measurement Science and Technology: https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6501/ad3ea3/meta</p></details> |

This article investigates the use of 4D imaging radars for SLAM and analyzes the challenges in robust loop closure. Previous work indicates that 4D radars, together with inertial measurements, offer ample information for accurate odometry estimation. However, the low field of view, limited resolution, and sparse and noisy measurements render loop closure a significantly more challenging problem. Our work builds on the previous work - TBV SLAM - which was proposed for robust loop closure with 360$^\circ$ spinning radars. This article highlights and addresses challenges inherited from a directional 4D radar, such as sparsity, noise, and reduced field of view, and discusses why the common definition of a loop closure is unsuitable. By combining multiple quality measures for accurate loop closure detection adapted to 4D radar data, significant results in trajectory estimation are achieved; the absolute trajectory error is as low as 0.46 m over a distance of 1.8 km, with consistent operation over multiple environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the workshop "Radar in Robotics: Resilience from Signal to Navigation" at ICRA 2024</p></details> |

Existing research on lidar-based loop closure heavily relies on dense point cloud and 360 FOV lidars. This paper proposes an out-of-the-box NDT (Normal Distribution Transform) based global descriptor, NDT-Map-Code, designed for both on-road driving and underground valet parking scenarios. NDT-Map-Code can be directly extracted from the NDT map without the need for a dense point cloud, resulting in excellent scalability and low maintenance cost. The NDT representation is leveraged to identify representative patterns, which are further encoded according to their spatial location (bearing, range, and height). Experimental results on the NIO underground parking lot dataset and the KITTI dataset demonstrate that our method achieves significantly better performance compared to the state-of-the-art.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

It then grew to implement Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) on various robots and mobile platforms. As each application brings its own set of contraints on sensors, processing capabilities and locomotion, it raises the question of which SLAM approach is the most appropriate to use in terms of cost, accuracy, computation power and ease of integration. Since most of SLAM approaches are either visual or lidar-based, comparison is difficult. Therefore, we decided to extend RTAB-Map to support both visual and lidar SLAM, providing in one package a tool allowing users to implement and compare a variety of 3D and 2D solutions for a wide range of applications with different robots and sensors. This paper presents this extended version of RTAB-Map and its use in comparing, both quantitatively and qualitatively, a large selection of popular real-world datasets (e.g., KITTI, EuRoC, TUM RGB-D, MIT Stata Center on PR2 robot), outlining strengths and limitations of visual and lidar SLAM configurations from a practical perspective for autonomous navigation applications.</p></details> | 40 pages, 19 figures |
| **[mmPlace: Robust Place Recognition with Intermediate Frequency Signal of Low-cost Single-chip Millimeter Wave Radar](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04703v1)** | 2024-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Place recognition is crucial for tasks like loop-closure detection and re-localization. Single-chip millimeter wave radar (single-chip radar in short) emerges as a low-cost sensor option for place recognition, with the advantage of insensitivity to degraded visual environments. However, it encounters two challenges. Firstly, sparse point cloud from single-chip radar leads to poor performance when using current place recognition methods, which assume much denser data. Secondly, its performance significantly declines in scenarios involving rotational and lateral variations, due to limited overlap in its field of view (FOV). We propose mmPlace, a robust place recognition system to address these challenges. Specifically, mmPlace transforms intermediate frequency (IF) signal into range azimuth heatmap and employs a spatial encoder to extract features. Additionally, to improve the performance in scenarios involving rotational and lateral variations, mmPlace employs a rotating platform and concatenates heatmaps in a rotation cycle, effectively expanding the system's FOV. We evaluate mmPlace's performance on the milliSonic dataset, which is collected on the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) campus, the city roads surrounding the campus, and an underground parking garage. The results demonstrate that mmPlace outperforms point cloud-based methods and achieves 87.37% recall@1 in scenarios involving rotational and lateral variations.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |

In particular, orchards are a difficult case study due to structural similarity across the entire field. In this work, we address the place recognition problem in orchards resorting to 3D LiDAR data, which is considered a key modality for robustness. Hence, we propose ORCHNet, a deep-learning-based approach that maps 3D-LiDAR scans to global descriptors. Specifically, this work proposes a new global feature aggregation approach, which fuses multiple aggregation methods into a robust global descriptor. ORCHNet is evaluated on real-world data collected in orchards, comprising data from the summer and autumn seasons. To assess the robustness, we compare ORCHNet with state-of-the-art aggregation approaches on data from the same season and across seasons. Moreover, we additionally evaluate the proposed approach as part of a localization framework, where ORCHNet is used as a loop closure detector. The empirical results indicate that, on the place recognition task, ORCHNet outperforms the remaining approaches, and is also more robust across seasons. As for the localization, the edge cases where the path goes through the trees are solved when integrating ORCHNet as a loop detector, showing the potential applicability of the proposed approach in this task.

Brains also appear to learn maps, but the mechanisms are not known and it is unclear how to infer these maps from neural activity data. We present BrainSLAM; a method for performing SLAM using only population activity (local field potential, LFP) data simultaneously recorded from three brain regions in rats: hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and parietal cortex. This system uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to decode velocity and familiarity information from wavelet scalograms of neural local field potential data recorded from rats as they navigate a 2D maze. The CNN's output drives a RatSLAM-inspired architecture, powering an attractor network which performs path integration plus a separate system which performs `loop closure' (detecting previously visited locations and correcting map aliasing errors). Together, these three components can construct faithful representations of the environment while simultaneously tracking the animal's location. This is the first demonstration of inference of a spatial map from brain recordings. Our findings expand SLAM to a new modality, enabling a new method of mapping environments and facilitating a better understanding of the role of cognitive maps in navigation and decision making.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 23rd International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems. 2024</p></details> |
| **[Attacking the Loop: Adversarial Attacks on Graph-based Loop Closure Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06991v1)** | 2023-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the advancement in robotics, it is becoming increasingly common for large factories and warehouses to incorporate visual SLAM (vSLAM) enabled automated robots that operate closely next to humans. This makes any adversarial attacks on vSLAM components potentially detrimental to humans working alongside them. Loop Closure Detection (LCD) is a crucial component in vSLAM that minimizes the accumulation of drift in mapping, since even a small drift can accumulate into a significant drift over time. A prior work by Kim et al., SymbioLCD2, unified visual features and semantic objects into a single graph structure for finding loop closure candidates. While this provided a performance improvement over visual feature-based LCD, it also created a single point of vulnerability for potential graph-based adversarial attacks. Unlike previously reported visual-patch based attacks, small graph perturbations are far more challenging to detect, making them a more significant threat. In this paper, we present Adversarial-LCD, a novel black-box evasion attack framework that employs an eigencentrality-based perturbation method and an SVM-RBF surrogate model with a Weisfeiler-Lehman feature extractor for attacking graph-based LCD. Our evaluation shows that the attack performance of Adversarial-LCD with the SVM-RBF surrogate model was superior to that of other machine learning surrogate algorithms, including SVM-linear, SVM-polynomial, and Bayesian classifier, demonstrating the effectiveness of our attack framework. Furthermore, we show that our eigencentrality-based perturbation method outperforms other algorithms, such as Random-walk and Shortest-path, highlighting the efficiency of Adversarial-LCD's perturbation selection method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at VISIGRAPP 2024, 8 pages</p></details> |

However, conventional loop closure methods based on low-level geometric or image features may cause high ambiguity by not distinguishing similar scenarios. Thus, incorrect loop closures can occur. Though semantic 2D image information is considered in some literature to detect loop closures, there is little work that compares 3D scenes as an integral part of a semantic SLAM system. This paper introduces an approach, called SmSLAM+LCD, integrated into a semantic SLAM system to combine high-level 3D semantic information and low-level feature information to conduct accurate loop closure detection and effective drift reduction. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated in testing results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Outram: One-shot Global Localization via Triangulated Scene Graph and Global Outlier Pruning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08914v1)** | 2023-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One-shot LiDAR localization refers to the ability to estimate the robot pose from one single point cloud, which yields significant advantages in initialization and relocalization processes. In the point cloud domain, the topic has been extensively studied as a global descriptor retrieval (i.e., loop closure detection) and pose refinement (i.e., point cloud registration) problem both in isolation or combined. However, few have explicitly considered the relationship between candidate retrieval and correspondence generation in pose estimation, leaving them brittle to substructure ambiguities. To this end, we propose a hierarchical one-shot localization algorithm called Outram that leverages substructures of 3D scene graphs for locally consistent correspondence searching and global substructure-wise outlier pruning. Such a hierarchical process couples the feature retrieval and the correspondence extraction to resolve the substructure ambiguities by conducting a local-to-global consistency refinement. We demonstrate the capability of Outram in a variety of scenarios in multiple large-scale outdoor datasets. Our implementation is open-sourced: https://github.com/Pamphlett/Outram.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

These applications encompass object recognition, image retrieval, and video analysis. LCD consists in identifying whether a robot has returned to a previously visited location, referred to as a loop, and then estimating the related roto-translation with respect to the analyzed location. Despite the numerous advantages of radar sensors, such as their ability to operate under diverse weather conditions and provide a wider range of view compared to other commonly used sensors (e.g., cameras or LiDARs), integrating radar data remains an arduous task due to intrinsic noise and distortion. To address this challenge, this research introduces RadarLCD, a novel supervised deep learning pipeline specifically designed for Loop Closure Detection using the FMCW Radar (Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave) sensor. RadarLCD, a learning-based LCD methodology explicitly designed for radar systems, makes a significant contribution by leveraging the pre-trained HERO (Hybrid Estimation Radar Odometry) model. Being originally developed for radar odometry, HERO's features are used to select key points crucial for LCD tasks. The methodology undergoes evaluation across a variety of FMCW Radar dataset scenes, and it is compared to state-of-the-art systems such as Scan Context for Place Recognition and ICP for Loop Closure. The results demonstrate that RadarLCD surpasses the alternatives in multiple aspects of Loop Closure Detection.</p></details> | 7 pages, 2 figures |

As a result of these disruptions, pervasive in indoor spaces, magnetic field data is often omitted from navigation algorithms in indoor environments. This paper leverages the spatially-varying disruptions to Earth's magnetic field to extract positional information for use in indoor navigation algorithms. The algorithm uses a rate gyro and an array of four magnetometers to estimate the robot's pose. Additionally, the magnetometer array is used to compute attitude-invariant measurements associated with the magnetic field and its gradient. These measurements are used to detect loop closure points. Experimental results indicate that the proposed approach can estimate the pose of a ground robot in an indoor environment within meter accuracy.</p></details> |  |

But the LiDAR-SLAM could be disturbed by current scene moving objects, resulting in drift errors and even loop-closure failure. Thus, the ability to detect and segment moving objects is essential for high-precision positioning and building a consistent map. In this paper, we address the problem of moving object segmentation from 3D LiDAR scans to improve the odometry and loop-closure accuracy of SLAM. We propose a novel 3D Sequential Moving-Object-Segmentation (3D-SeqMOS) method that can accurately segment the scene into moving and static objects, such as moving and static cars. Different from the existing projected-image method, we process the raw 3D point cloud and build a 3D convolution neural network for MOS task. In addition, to make full use of the spatio-temporal information of point cloud, we propose a point cloud residual mechanism using the spatial features of current scan and the temporal features of previous residual scans. Besides, we build a complete SLAM framework to verify the effectiveness and accuracy of 3D-SeqMOS. Experiments on SemanticKITTI dataset show that our proposed 3D-SeqMOS method can effectively detect moving objects and improve the accuracy of LiDAR odometry and loop-closure detection. The test results show our 3D-SeqMOS outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 12.4%. We extend the proposed method to the SemanticKITTI: Moving Object Segmentation competition and achieve the 2nd in the leaderboard, showing its effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present a novel radar-only place recognition that measures the similarity score by utilizing Radon-transformed sinogram images and cross-correlation in frequency domain. Doing so achieves rigid transform invariance during place recognition, while ignoring the effects of radar multipath and ring noises. In addition, we compute the radar similarity distance using mutable threshold to mitigate variability of the similarity score, and reduce the time complexity of processing a copious radar data with hierarchical retrieval. We demonstrate the matching performance for both intra-session loop-closure detection and global place recognition using a publicly available imaging radar datasets. We verify reliable performance compared to existing stable radar place recognition method.

Traditional large-scale map merging methods are fragile to incorrect data associations, and are primarily limited to working only offline. AutoMerge utilizes multi-perspective fusion and adaptive loop closure detection for accurate data associations, and it uses incremental merging to assemble large maps from individual trajectory segments given in random order and with no initial estimations. Furthermore, after assembling the segments, AutoMerge performs fine matching and pose-graph optimization to globally smooth the merged map. We demonstrate AutoMerge on both city-scale merging (120km) and campus-scale repeated merging (4.5km x 8). The experiments show that AutoMerge (i) surpasses the second- and third- best methods by 14% and 24% recall in segment retrieval, (ii) achieves comparable 3D mapping accuracy for 120 km large-scale map assembly, (iii) and it is robust to temporally-spaced revisits. To the best of our knowledge, AutoMerge is the first mapping approach that can merge hundreds of kilometers of individual segments without the aid of GPS.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 20 figures, IEEE Transactions on Robotics (T-RO) 2023</p></details> |

It enables the recognition of previously visited scenes to eliminate pose and map estimate drifts arising from long-term exploration. However, current appearance-based LCD methods face significant challenges, including high computational costs, viewpoint variance, and dynamic objects in scenes. This paper introduced an online appearance based LCD using local superpixel grids descriptor and dynamic node, i.e, LSGDDN-LCD, to find similarities between scenes via hand-crafted features extracted from LSGD. Unlike traditional Bag-of-Words (BoW) based LCD, which requires pre-training, we proposed an adaptive mechanism to group similar images called $\textbf{\textit{dynamic}}$ $\textbf{\textit{node}}$, which incrementally adjusted the database in an online manner, allowing for efficient and online retrieval of previously viewed images without need of the pre-training. Experimental results confirmed that the LSGDDN-LCD significantly improved LCD precision-recall and efficiency, and outperformed several state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches on multiple typical datasets, indicating its great potential as a generic LCD framework.</p></details> |  |

Recently, 3D LiDAR-based localization methods have used retrieval-based place recognition to find revisited places efficiently. However, when deployed in challenging real-world scenarios, the place recognition models become more complex, which comes at the cost of high computational demand. This work tackles this problem from an information-retrieval perspective, adopting a first-retrieve-then-re-ranking paradigm, where an initial loop candidate ranking, generated from a 3D place recognition model, is re-ordered by a proposed lightweight transformer-based re-ranking approach (TReR). The proposed approach relies on global descriptors only, being agnostic to the place recognition model. The experimental evaluation, conducted on the KITTI Odometry dataset, where we compared TReR with s.o.t.a. re-ranking approaches such as alphaQE and SGV, indicate the robustness and efficiency when compared to alphaQE while offering a good trade-off between robustness and efficiency when compared to SGV.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This preprint has been submitted to 26th IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems ITSC 2023</p></details> |

Despite the fast-paced progress in robot perception, most existing methods either build purely geometric maps (as in traditional SLAM) or flat metric-semantic maps that do not scale to large environments or large dictionaries of semantic labels. The first part of this paper is concerned with representations: we show that scalable representations for spatial perception need to be hierarchical in nature. Hierarchical representations are efficient to store, and lead to layered graphs with small treewidth, which enable provably efficient inference. We then introduce an example of hierarchical representation for indoor environments, namely a 3D scene graph, and discuss its structure and properties. The second part of the paper focuses on algorithms to incrementally construct a 3D scene graph as the robot explores the environment. Our algorithms combine 3D geometry, topology (to cluster the places into rooms), and geometric deep learning (e.g., to classify the type of rooms the robot is moving across). The third part of the paper focuses on algorithms to maintain and correct 3D scene graphs during long-term operation. We propose hierarchical descriptors for loop closure detection and describe how to correct a scene graph in response to loop closures, by solving a 3D scene graph optimization problem. We conclude the paper by combining the proposed perception algorithms into Hydra, a real-time spatial perception system that builds a 3D scene graph from visual-inertial data in real-time. We showcase Hydra's performance in photo-realistic simulations and real data collected by a Clearpath Jackal robots and a Unitree A1 robot.

This paper describes Hydra-Multi, the first multi-robot spatial perception system capable of constructing a multi-robot 3D scene graph online from sensor data collected by robots in a team. In particular, we develop a centralized system capable of constructing a joint 3D scene graph by taking incremental inputs from multiple robots, effectively finding the relative transforms between the robots' frames, and incorporating loop closure detections to correctly reconcile the scene graph nodes from different robots. We evaluate Hydra-Multi on simulated and real scenarios and show it is able to reconstruct accurate 3D scene graphs online. We also demonstrate Hydra-Multi's capability of supporting heterogeneous teams by fusing different map representations built by robots with different sensor suites.</p></details> | 8 pages, 10 figures |

In this paper, we present an object-based loop closure detection method based on the spatial layout and semanic consistency of the 3D scene graph. Firstly, we propose an object-level data association approach based on the semantic information from semantic labels, intersection over union (IoU), object color, and object embedding. Subsequently, multi-view bundle adjustment with the associated objects is utilized to jointly optimize the poses of objects and cameras. We represent the refined objects as a 3D spatial graph with semantics and topology. Then, we propose a graph matching approach to select correspondence objects based on the structure layout and semantic property similarity of vertices' neighbors. Finally, we jointly optimize camera trajectories and object poses in an object-level pose graph optimization, which results in a globally consistent map. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed data association approach can construct more accurate 3D semantic maps, and our loop closure method is more robust than point-based and object-based methods in circumstances with large viewpoint changes.</p></details> |  |

Most LiDAR-based methods achieve this goal by using only the geometric information, disregarding the semantics of the scene. In this work, we introduce PADLoC for joint loop closure detection and registration in LiDAR-based SLAM frameworks. We propose a novel transformer-based head for point cloud matching and registration, and to leverage panoptic information during training time. In particular, we propose a novel loss function that reframes the matching problem as a classification task for the semantic labels and as a graph connectivity assignment for the instance labels. During inference, PADLoC does not require panoptic annotations, making it more versatile than other methods. Additionally, we show that using two shared matching and registration heads with their source and target inputs swapped increases the overall performance by enforcing forward-backward consistency. We perform extensive evaluations of PADLoC on multiple real-world datasets demonstrating that it achieves state-of-the-art results.

| **[Optimized SC-F-LOAM: Optimized Fast LiDAR Odometry and Mapping Using Scan Context](http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.04932v2)** | 2023-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR odometry can achieve accurate vehicle pose estimation for short driving range or in small-scale environments, but for long driving range or in large-scale environments, the accuracy deteriorates as a result of cumulative estimation errors. This drawback necessitates the inclusion of loop closure detection in a SLAM framework to suppress the adverse effects of cumulative errors. To improve the accuracy of pose estimation, we propose a new LiDAR-based SLAM method which uses F-LOAM as LiDAR odometry, Scan Context for loop closure detection, and GTSAM for global optimization. In our approach, an adaptive distance threshold (instead of a fixed threshold) is employed for loop closure detection, which achieves more accurate loop closure detection results. Besides, a feature-based matching method is used in our approach to compute vehicle pose transformations between loop closure point cloud pairs, instead of using the raw point cloud obtained by the LiDAR sensor, which significantly reduces the computation time. The KITTI dataset is used for verifications of our method, and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms typical LiDAR odometry/SLAM methods in the literature. Our code is made publicly available for the benefit of the community.</p></details> |  |

Natural and unstructured environments present many additional challenges for the tasks of long-term localisation but these environments are not represented in currently available datasets. To address this we introduce Wild-Places, a challenging large-scale dataset for lidar place recognition in unstructured, natural environments. Wild-Places contains eight lidar sequences collected with a handheld sensor payload over the course of fourteen months, containing a total of 63K undistorted lidar submaps along with accurate 6DoF ground truth. Our dataset contains multiple revisits both within and between sequences, allowing for both intra-sequence (i.e. loop closure detection) and inter-sequence (i.e. re-localisation) place recognition. We also benchmark several state-of-the-art approaches to demonstrate the challenges that this dataset introduces, particularly the case of long-term place recognition due to natural environments changing over time. Our dataset and code will be available at https://csiro-robotics.github.io/Wild-Places.</p></details> | <details><summary>Equal...</summary><p>Equal Contribution from first two authors Accepted to ICRA2023 Website link: https://csiro-robotics.github.io/Wild-Places/</p></details> |
| **[Region Prediction for Efficient Robot Localization on Large Maps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00295v1)** | 2023-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recognizing already explored places (a.k.a. place recognition) is a fundamental task in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) to enable robot relocalization and loop closure detection. In topological SLAM the recognition takes place by comparing a signature (or feature vector) associated to the current node with the signatures of the nodes in the known map. However, as the number of nodes increases, matching the current node signature against all the existing ones becomes inefficient and thwarts real-time navigation. In this paper we propose a novel approach to pre-select a subset of map nodes for place recognition. The map nodes are clustered during exploration and each cluster is associated with a region. The region labels become the prediction targets of a deep neural network and, during navigation, only the nodes associated with the regions predicted with high probability are considered for matching. While the proposed technique can be integrated in different SLAM approaches, in this work we describe an effective integration with RTAB-Map (a popular framework for real-time topological SLAM) which allowed us to design and run several experiments to demonstrate its effectiveness. All the code and material from the experiments will be available online at https://github.com/MI-BioLab/region-learner.</p></details> |  |

Integrating the Ultra-Wideband(UWB) technique has been shown to correct the long-term estimation drift and bypass the complexity of loop closure detection. However, few works on robotics adopt UWB as a stand-alone state estimation solution. The primary purpose of this work is to investigate planar pose estimation using only UWB range measurements and study the estimator's statistical efficiency. We prove the excellent property of a two-step scheme, which says that we can refine a consistent estimator to be asymptotically efficient by one step of Gauss-Newton iteration. Grounded on this result, we design the GN-ULS estimator and evaluate it through simulations and collected datasets. GN-ULS attains millimeter and sub-degree level accuracy on our static datasets and attains centimeter and degree level accuracy on our dynamic datasets, presenting the possibility of using only UWB for real-time state estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Update the content and improve consistency with the ICRA version</p></details> |

We interpret the Cartesian birds' eye view (BEV) image projected from 3D LiDAR points as layered distribution of structures. To recover elevation information from BEVs, we slice them at different heights, and connected pixels at each level will form contours. Each contour is parameterized by abstract information, e.g., pixel count, center position, covariance, and mean height. The similarity of two BEVs is calculated in sequential discrete and continuous steps. The first step considers the geometric consensus of graph-like constellations formed by contours in particular localities. The second step models the majority of contours as a 2.5D Gaussian mixture model, which is used to calculate correlation and optimize relative transform in continuous space. A retrieval key is designed to accelerate the search of a database indexed by layered KD-trees. We validate the efficacy of our method by comparing it with recent works on public datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 7 figures, accepted by ICRA 2023</p></details> |

Our proposed SLAM system is consist of visual-inertial odometry (VIO) and LiDAR inertial odometry (LIO) subsystems. We propose the LIO subsystem utilizing the measurement from the LiDAR and the inertial sensors to build the local odometry map, and propose the VIO subsystem which takes in the visual information to construct the 2D-3D associated map. Then, we propose an iterative Kalman Filter-based optimization function to optimize the local project-based 2D-to-3D photo-metric error between the projected image pixels and the local 3D points to make the robust 2D-3D alignment. Finally, we have also proposed the back-end pose graph global optimization and the elaborately designed loop closure detection network to improve the accuracy of the whole SLAM system.

Existing tactile surface reconstruction methods rely on external sensors or have strong prior assumptions, making the operation complex and limiting their application scenarios. This paper presents a framework for low-drift surface reconstruction through multiple tactile measurements, Tac2Structure. Compared with existing algorithms, the proposed method uses only a new vision-based tactile sensor without relying on external devices. Aiming at the difficulty that reconstruction accuracy is easily affected by the pressure at contact, we propose a correction algorithm to adapt it. The proposed method also reduces the accumulative errors that occur easily during global object surface reconstruction. Multi-frame tactile measurements can accurately reconstruct object surfaces by jointly using the point cloud registration algorithm, loop-closure detection algorithm based on deep learning, and pose graph optimization algorithm. Experiments verify that Tac2Structure can achieve millimeter-level accuracy in reconstructing the surface of objects, providing accurate tactile information for the robot to perceive the surrounding environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Robotics And Automation Letters</p></details> |

With the success of DL approaches in learning useful information from 3D LiDARs, place recognition has also benefited from this modality, which has led to higher re-localization and loop-closure detection performance, particularly, in environments with significant changing conditions. Despite the progress in this field, the extraction of proper and efficient descriptors from 3D LiDAR data that are invariant to changing conditions and orientation is still an unsolved challenge. To address this problem, this work proposes a novel 3D LiDAR-based deep learning network (named AttDLNet) that uses a range-based proxy representation for point clouds and an attention network with stacked attention layers to selectively focus on long-range context and inter-feature relationships. The proposed network is trained and validated on the KITTI dataset and an ablation study is presented to assess the novel attention network. Results show that adding attention to the network improves performance, leading to efficient loop closures, and outperforming an established 3D LiDAR-based place recognition approach. From the ablation study, results indicate that the middle encoder layers have the highest mean performance, while deeper layers are more robust to orientation change.

| **[GraffMatch: Global Matching of 3D Lines and Planes for Wide Baseline LiDAR Registration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12745v1)** | 2022-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Using geometric landmarks like lines and planes can increase navigation accuracy and decrease map storage requirements compared to commonly-used LiDAR point cloud maps. However, landmark-based registration for applications like loop closure detection is challenging because a reliable initial guess is not available. Global landmark matching has been investigated in the literature, but these methods typically use ad hoc representations of 3D line and plane landmarks that are not invariant to large viewpoint changes, resulting in incorrect matches and high registration error. To address this issue, we adopt the affine Grassmannian manifold to represent 3D lines and planes and prove that the distance between two landmarks is invariant to rotation and translation if a shift operation is performed before applying the Grassmannian metric. This invariance property enables the use of our graph-based data association framework for identifying landmark matches that can subsequently be used for registration in the least-squares sense. Evaluated on a challenging landmark matching and registration task using publicly-available LiDAR datasets, our approach yields a 1.7x and 3.5x improvement in successful registrations compared to methods that use viewpoint-dependent centroid and "closest point" representations, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted to RA-L; 8 pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2205.08556</p></details> |

In this work, we propose a faster, lighter and stronger approach that can generate models with fewer parameters and can spend less time in the inference stage. We designed RepVGG-lite as the backbone network in our architecture, it is more discriminative than other general networks in the Place Recognition task. RepVGG-lite has more speed advantages while achieving higher performance. We extract only one scale patch-level descriptors from global descriptors in the feature extraction stage. Then we design a trainable feature matcher to exploit both spatial relationships of the features and their visual appearance, which is based on the attention mechanism. Comprehensive experiments on challenging benchmark datasets demonstrate the proposed method outperforming recent other state-of-the-art learned approaches, and achieving even higher inference speed. Our system has 14 times less params than Patch-NetVLAD, 6.8 times lower theoretical FLOPs, and run faster 21 and 33 times in feature extraction and feature matching. Moreover, the performance of our approach is 0.5\% better than Patch-NetVLAD in Recall@1.

Our approach decreases the computational overhead of classical approaches by pruning the search space of potential loop closures, prior to evaluation by a typical multi-robot SLAM pipeline. Wi-Closure achieves this by identifying candidates that are spatially close to each other by using sensing over the wireless communication signal between robots, even when they are operating in non-line-of-sight or in remote areas of the environment from one another. We demonstrate the validity of our approach in simulation and hardware experiments. Our results show that using Wi-closure greatly reduces computation time, by 54% in simulation and by 77% in hardware compared, with a multi-robot SLAM baseline. Importantly, this is achieved without sacrificing accuracy. Using Wi-Closure reduces absolute trajectory estimation error by 99% in simulation and 89.2% in hardware experiments. This improvement is due in part to Wi-Closure's ability to avoid catastrophic optimization failure that typically occurs with classical approaches in challenging repetitive environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages without references</p></details> |

This is one of the most critical questions that any intelligent system should answer to decide whether it navigates to a previously visited area. This problem has long been acknowledged for its challenging nature in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), wherein the robot needs to correctly associate the incoming sensory data to the database allowing consistent map generation. The significant advances in computer vision achieved over the last 20 years, the increased computational power, and the growing demand for long-term exploration contributed to efficiently performing such a complex task with inexpensive perception sensors. In this article, visual loop closure detection, which formulates a solution based solely on appearance input data, is surveyed. We start by briefly introducing place recognition and SLAM concepts in robotics. Then, we describe a loop closure detection system's structure, covering an extensive collection of topics, including the feature extraction, the environment representation, the decision-making step, and the evaluation process. We conclude by discussing open and new research challenges, particularly concerning the robustness in dynamic environments, the computational complexity, and scalability in long-term operations. The article aims to serve as a tutorial and a position paper for newcomers to visual loop closure detection.</p></details> | 25 pages, 15 figures |
| **[A Framework for Collaborative Multi-Robot Mapping using Spectral Graph Wavelets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13856v2)** | 2022-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The exploration of large-scale unknown environments can benefit from the deployment of multiple robots for collaborative mapping. Each robot explores a section of the environment and communicates onboard pose estimates and maps to a central server to build an optimized global multi-robot map. Naturally, inconsistencies can arise between onboard and server estimates due to onboard odometry drift, failures, or degeneracies. The mapping server can correct and overcome such failure cases using computationally expensive operations such as inter-robot loop closure detection and multi-modal mapping. However, the individual robots do not benefit from the collaborative map if the mapping server provides no feedback. Although server updates from the multi-robot map can greatly alleviate the robotic mission strategically, most existing work lacks them, due to their associated computational and bandwidth-related costs. Motivated by this challenge, this paper proposes a novel collaborative mapping framework that enables global mapping consistency among robots and the mapping server. In particular, we propose graph spectral analysis, at different spatial scales, to detect structural differences between robot and server graphs, and to generate necessary constraints for the individual robot pose graphs. Our approach specifically finds the nodes that correspond to the drift's origin rather than the nodes where the error becomes too large. We thoroughly analyze and validate our proposed framework using several real-world multi-robot field deployments where we show improvements of the onboard system up to 90\% and can recover the onboard estimation from localization failures and even from the degeneracies within its estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2203.00308</p></details> |

In recent years, deep learning brings improvements to place recognition by learnable feature extraction. However, these methods degenerate when the robot re-visits previous places with large perspective difference. To address the challenge, we propose DeepRING to learn the roto-translation invariant representation from LiDAR scan, so that robot visits the same place with different perspective can have similar representations. There are two keys in DeepRING: the feature is extracted from sinogram, and the feature is aggregated by magnitude spectrum. The two steps keeps the final representation with both discrimination and roto-translation invariance. Moreover, we state the place recognition as a one-shot learning problem with each place being a class, leveraging relation learning to build representation similarity. Substantial experiments are carried out on public datasets, validating the effectiveness of each proposed component, and showing that DeepRING outperforms the comparative methods, especially in dataset level generalization.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |

Each sensor is processed by a bio-inspired Spiking Neural Network (SNN) with continual Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) learning, as observed in the brain. In contrast to most learning-based SLAM systems%, which a) require the acquisition of a representative dataset of the environment in which navigation must be performed and b) require an off-line training phase, our method does not require any offline training phase, but rather the SNN continuously learns features from the input data on the fly via STDP. At the same time, the SNN outputs are used as feature descriptors for loop closure detection and map correction. We conduct numerous experiments to benchmark our system against state-of-the-art RGB methods and we demonstrate the robustness of our DVS-Radar SLAM approach under strong lighting variations.</p></details> |  |

Besides, a fast two-stage pose estimation method is proposed to estimate the relative pose after place retrieval by utilizing the compact 2D point clouds extracted from the original data.

| **[Closing the Loop: Graph Networks to Unify Semantic Objects and Visual Features for Multi-object Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11894v1)** | 2022-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), Loop Closure Detection (LCD) is essential to minimize drift when recognizing previously visited places. Visual Bag-of-Words (vBoW) has been an LCD algorithm of choice for many state-of-the-art SLAM systems. It uses a set of visual features to provide robust place recognition but fails to perceive the semantics or spatial relationship between feature points. Previous work has mainly focused on addressing these issues by combining vBoW with semantic and spatial information from objects in the scene. However, they are unable to exploit spatial information of local visual features and lack a structure that unifies semantic objects and visual features, therefore limiting the symbiosis between the two components. This paper proposes SymbioLCD2, which creates a unified graph structure to integrate semantic objects and visual features symbiotically. Our novel graph-based LCD system utilizes the unified graph structure by applying a Weisfeiler-Lehman graph kernel with temporal constraints to robustly predict loop closure candidates. Evaluation of the proposed system shows that having a unified graph structure incorporating semantic objects and visual features improves LCD prediction accuracy, illustrating that the proposed graph structure provides a strong symbiosis between these two complementary components. It also outperforms other Machine Learning algorithms - such as SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Neural Network and GNN based Graph Matching Networks. Furthermore, it has shown good performance in detecting loop closure candidates earlier than state-of-the-art SLAM systems, demonstrating that extended semantic and spatial awareness from the unified graph structure significantly impacts LCD performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages.

Loop closure is a key element of SLAM, with many established methods for this problem. However, current methods are narrow, using either geometric or salient based features. We merge their successes into a model that outperforms both types of methods alone. Our method utilizes inexpensive monocular cameras and does not depend on depth sensors nor Lidar. HGI-SLAM utilizes geometric and salient features, processes them into descriptors, and optimizes them for a bag of words algorithm. By using a concurrent thread and combing our loop closure detection with ORB-SLAM2, our system is a complete SLAM framework. We present extensive evaluations of HGI loop detection and HGI-SLAM on the KITTI and EuRoC datasets. We also provide a qualitative analysis of our features. Our method runs in real time, and is robust to large viewpoint changes while staying accurate in organic environments. HGI-SLAM is an end-to-end SLAM system that only requires monocular vision and is comparable in performance to state-of-the-art SLAM methods.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |

In the case of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) equipped with multibeam echosounders (MBES), data association is particularly challenging due to the scarcity of identifiable landmarks in the seabed, the large drift in dead-reckoning navigation estimates to which AUVs are prone and the low resolution characteristic of MBES data. Deep learning solutions to loop closure detection have shown excellent performance on data from more structured environments. However, their transfer to the seabed domain is not immediate and efforts to port them are hindered by the lack of bathymetric datasets. Thus, in this paper we propose a neural network architecture aimed to showcase the potential of adapting such techniques to correspondence matching in bathymetric data. We train our framework on real bathymetry from an AUV mission and evaluate its performance on the tasks of loop closure detection and coarse point cloud alignment. Finally, we show its potential against a more traditional method and release both its implementation and the dataset used.</p></details> |  |

The place recognition community has made astonishing progress over the last $20$ years, and this has attracted widespread research interest and application in multiple fields such as computer vision and robotics. However, few methods have shown promising place recognition performance in complex real-world scenarios, where long-term and large-scale appearance changes usually result in failures. Additionally, there is a lack of an integrated framework amongst the state-of-the-art methods that can handle all of the challenges in place recognition, which include appearance changes, viewpoint differences, robustness to unknown areas, and efficiency in real-world applications. In this work, we survey the state-of-the-art methods that target long-term localization and discuss future directions and opportunities. We start by investigating the formulation of place recognition in long-term autonomy and the major challenges in real-world environments. We then review the recent works in place recognition for different sensor modalities and current strategies for dealing with various place recognition challenges. Finally, we review the existing datasets for long-term localization and introduce our datasets and evaluation API for different approaches. This paper can be a tutorial for researchers new to the place recognition community and those who care about long-term robotics autonomy. We also provide our opinion on the frequently asked question in robotics: Do robots need accurate localization for long-term autonomy?

With the popularization and application of the technology in wide scope, the practicability of SLAM system has become a new hot topic after the accuracy and robustness, e.g., how to keep the stability of the system and achieve accurate pose estimation in the low-texture and dynamic environment, and how to improve the universality and real-time performance of the system in the real scenes, etc. This paper proposes a real-time stereo indirect visual SLAM system, PLD-SLAM, which combines point and line features, and avoid the impact of dynamic objects in highly dynamic environments. We also present a novel global gray similarity (GGS) algorithm to achieve reasonable keyframe selection and efficient loop closure detection (LCD). Benefiting from the GGS, PLD-SLAM can realize real-time accurate pose estimation in most real scenes without pre-training and loading a huge feature dictionary model. To verify the performance of the proposed system, we compare it with existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on the public datasets KITTI, EuRoC MAV, and the indoor stereo datasets provided by us, etc. The experiments show that the PLD-SLAM has better real-time performance while ensuring stability and accuracy in most scenarios. In addition, through the analysis of the experimental results of the GGS, we can find it has excellent performance in the keyframe selection and LCD.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, we let a Hyperbolic Graph Convolutional Neural Network (HGCN) to operate over the SURF features graph space, and perform vector quantization part of the SLAM procedure. This part previously was performed in an unsupervised manner using algorithms like HKmeans, kmeans++,..etc. The main Advantage of using HGCN, is that it scales linearly in number of graph edges. Experimental results shows that HGCN-FABMAP algorithm needs far more cluster centroids than HGCN-ORB, otherwise it fails to detect loop closures. Therefore we consider HGCN-ORB to be more efficient in terms of memory consumption, also we conclude the superiority of HGCN-BoW and HGCN-FABMAP with respect to other algorithms.</p></details> |  |

We also present AE-ORB-SLAM, a modified version of the current state of the art BoW-based path planning algorithm. That is, we have used a deep convolutional autoencoder to find loop closures. In the context of bag of words visual SLAM, vector quantization (VQ) is considered as the most time-consuming part of the SLAM procedure, which is usually performed in the offline phase of the SLAM algorithm using unsupervised algorithms such as Kmeans++. We have addressed the loop closure detection part of the BoW-based SLAM methods in a self-supervised manner, by integrating an autoencoder for doing vector quantization. This approach can increase the accuracy of large-scale SLAM, where plenty of unlabeled data is available. The main advantage of using a self-supervised is that it can help reducing the amount of labeling. Furthermore, experiments show that autoencoders are far more efficient than semi-supervised methods like graph convolutional neural networks, in terms of speed and memory consumption. We integrated this method into the state of the art long range appearance based visual bag of word SLAM, FABMAP2, also in ORB-SLAM. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of this approach in indoor and outdoor datasets over regular FABMAP2 in all cases, and it achieves higher accuracy in loop closure detection and trajectory generation.</p></details> |  |

This crucial requirement is faced with many challenges in complex and perceptually-degraded subterranean environments, as the onboard perception system is required to operate in off-nominal conditions (poor visibility due to darkness and dust, rugged and muddy terrain, and the presence of self-similar and ambiguous scenes). In a disaster response scenario and in the absence of prior information about the environment, robots must rely on noisy sensor data and perform Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) to build a 3D map of the environment and localize themselves and potential survivors. To that end, this paper reports on a multi-robot SLAM system developed by team CoSTAR in the context of the DARPA Subterranean Challenge. We extend our previous work, LAMP, by incorporating a single-robot front-end interface that is adaptable to different odometry sources and lidar configurations, a scalable multi-robot front-end to support inter- and intra-robot loop closure detection for large scale environments and multi-robot teams, and a robust back-end equipped with an outlier-resilient pose graph optimization based on Graduated Non-Convexity. We provide a detailed ablation study on the multi-robot front-end and back-end, and assess the overall system performance in challenging real-world datasets collected across mines, power plants, and caves in the United States. We also release our multi-robot back-end datasets (and the corresponding ground truth), which can serve as challenging benchmarks for large-scale underground SLAM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hydra: A Real-time Spatial Perception System for 3D Scene Graph Construction and Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.13360v2)** | 2022-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D scene graphs have recently emerged as a powerful high-level representation of 3D environments. A 3D scene graph describes the environment as a layered graph where nodes represent spatial concepts at multiple levels of abstraction and edges represent relations between concepts. While 3D scene graphs can serve as an advanced "mental model" for robots, how to build such a rich representation in real-time is still uncharted territory. This paper describes a real-time Spatial Perception System, a suite of algorithms to build a 3D scene graph from sensor data in real-time. Our first contribution is to develop real-time algorithms to incrementally construct the layers of a scene graph as the robot explores the environment; these algorithms build a local Euclidean Signed Distance Function (ESDF) around the current robot location, extract a topological map of places from the ESDF, and then segment the places into rooms using an approach inspired by community-detection techniques. Our second contribution is to investigate loop closure detection and optimization in 3D scene graphs. We show that 3D scene graphs allow defining hierarchical descriptors for loop closure detection; our descriptors capture statistics across layers in the scene graph, ranging from low-level visual appearance to summary statistics about objects and places. We then propose the first algorithm to optimize a 3D scene graph in response to loop closures; our approach relies on embedded deformation graphs to simultaneously correct all layers of the scene graph. We implement the proposed Spatial Perception System into a architecture named Hydra, that combines fast early and mid-level perception processes with slower high-level perception. We evaluate Hydra on simulated and real data and show it is able to reconstruct 3D scene graphs with an accuracy comparable with batch offline methods despite running online.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 10 figures, published in Robotics Science and Systems (RSS) 2022 proceedings</p></details> |

However, LiDARs do not perform well in geometrically-degraded environments, due to the challenge of loop closure detection and computational load to perform scan matching. Existing WiFi infrastructure can be exploited for localization and mapping with low hardware and computational cost. Yet, accurate pose estimation using WiFi is challenging as different signal values can be measured at the same location due to the unpredictability of signal propagation. Therefore, we introduce the use of WiFi fingerprint sequence for pose estimation (i.e. loop closure) in SLAM. This approach exploits the spatial coherence of location fingerprints obtained while a mobile robot is moving. This has better capability of correcting odometry drift. The method also incorporates LiDAR scans and thus, improving computational efficiency for large and geometrically-degraded environments while maintaining the accuracy of LiDAR SLAM. We conducted experiments in an indoor environment to illustrate the effectiveness of the method. The results are evaluated based on Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and it has achieved an accuracy of 0.88m for the test environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by the 2022 IEEE 18th International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE)</p></details> |

In this paper, aiming at strengthening the relevancy of local neighboring points and the contextual dependency among global points simultaneously, we investigate the exploitation of transformer-based network for feature extraction, and propose a Hierarchical Transformer for Place Recognition (HiTPR). The HiTPR consists of four major parts: point cell generation, short-range transformer (SRT), long-range transformer (LRT) and global descriptor aggregation. Specifically, the point cloud is initially divided into a sequence of small cells by downsampling and nearest neighbors searching. In the SRT, we extract the local feature for each point cell. While in the LRT, we build the global dependency among all of the point cells in the whole point cloud. Experiments on several standard benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of the HiTPR in terms of average recall rate, achieving 93.71% at top 1% and 86.63% at top 1 on the Oxford RobotCar dataset for example.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted paper in ICRA 2022</p></details> |
| **[Bi-directional Loop Closure for Visual SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.01524v1)** | 2022-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A key functional block of visual navigation system for intelligent autonomous vehicles is Loop Closure detection and subsequent relocalisation. State-of-the-Art methods still approach the problem as uni-directional along the direction of the previous motion. As a result, most of the methods fail in the absence of a significantly similar overlap of perspectives. In this study, we propose an approach for bi-directional loop closure. This will, for the first time, provide us with the capability to relocalize to a location even when traveling in the opposite direction, thus significantly reducing long-term odometry drift in the absence of a direct loop. We present a technique to select training data from large datasets in order to make them usable for the bi-directional problem. The data is used to train and validate two different CNN architectures for loop closure detection and subsequent regression of 6-DOF camera pose between the views in an end-to-end manner. The outcome packs a considerable impact and aids significantly to real-world scenarios that do not offer direct loop closure opportunities. We provide a rigorous empirical comparison against other established approaches and evaluate our method on both outdoor and indoor data from the FinnForest dataset and PennCOSYVIO dataset.</p></details> | 11 pages, 11 figures |
| **[AirLoop: Lifelong Loop Closure Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.08975v3)** | 2022-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Loop closure detection is an important building block that ensures the accuracy and robustness of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) systems. Due to their generalization ability, CNN-based approaches have received increasing attention. Although they normally benefit from training on datasets that are diverse and reflective of the environments, new environments often emerge after the model is deployed. It is therefore desirable to incorporate the data newly collected during operation for incremental learning. Nevertheless, simply finetuning the model on new data is infeasible since it may cause the model's performance on previously learned data to degrade over time, which is also known as the problem of catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we present AirLoop, a method that leverages techniques from lifelong learning to minimize forgetting when training loop closure detection models incrementally. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of AirLoop on TartanAir, Nordland, and RobotCar datasets. To the best of our knowledge, AirLoop is one of the first works to achieve lifelong learning of deep loop closure detectors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Modal Lidar Dataset for Benchmarking General-Purpose Localization and Mapping Algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03454v1)** | 2022-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lidar technology has evolved significantly over the last decade, with higher resolution, better accuracy, and lower cost devices available today. In addition, new scanning modalities and novel sensor technologies have emerged in recent years. Public datasets have enabled benchmarking of algorithms and have set standards for the cutting edge technology. However, existing datasets are not representative of the technological landscape, with only a reduced number of lidars available. This inherently limits the development and comparison of general-purpose algorithms in the evolving landscape. This paper presents a novel multi-modal lidar dataset with sensors showcasing different scanning modalities (spinning and solid-state), sensing technologies, and lidar cameras. The focus of the dataset is on low-drift odometry, with ground truth data available in both indoors and outdoors environment with sub-millimeter accuracy from a motion capture (MOCAP) system. For comparison in longer distances, we also include data recorded in larger spaces indoors and outdoors. The dataset contains point cloud data from spinning lidars and solid-state lidars. Also, it provides range images from high resolution spinning lidars, RGB and depth images from a lidar camera, and inertial data from built-in IMUs. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the lidar dataset with the most variety of sensors and environments where ground truth data is available. This dataset can be widely used in multiple research areas, such as 3D LiDAR simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), performance comparison between multi-modal lidars, appearance recognition and loop closure detection. The datasets are available at: https://github.com/TIERS/tiers-lidars-dataset.</p></details> | 8 pages |

L3Ds are emerging compact representations of patches extracted from point clouds that are learnt from data using a deep learning algorithm. We propose a novel overlap measure for loop detection by computing the metric error between points that correspond to mutually-nearest-neighbour descriptors after registering the loop candidate point cloud by its estimated relative pose. This novel approach enables us to accurately detect loops and estimate six degrees-of-freedom poses in the case of small overlaps. We compare our L3D-based loop closure approach with recent approaches on LiDAR data and achieve state-of-the-art loop closure detection accuracy. Additionally, we embed our loop closure approach in RESLAM, a recent edge-based SLAM system, and perform the evaluation on real-world RGBD-TUM and synthetic ICL datasets. Our approach enables RESLAM to achieve a better localisation accuracy compared to its original loop closure strategy.

Over the years, several deep learning approaches have been proposed to address this task, however their performance has been subpar compared to handcrafted techniques, especially while dealing with reverse loops. In this paper, we introduce the novel LCDNet that effectively detects loop closures in LiDAR point clouds by simultaneously identifying previously visited places and estimating the 6-DoF relative transformation between the current scan and the map. LCDNet is composed of a shared encoder, a place recognition head that extracts global descriptors, and a relative pose head that estimates the transformation between two point clouds. We introduce a novel relative pose head based on the unbalanced optimal transport theory that we implement in a differentiable manner to allow for end-to-end training. Extensive evaluations of LCDNet on multiple real-world autonomous driving datasets show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art loop closure detection and point cloud registration techniques by a large margin, especially while dealing with reverse loops. Moreover, we integrate our proposed loop closure detection approach into a LiDAR SLAM library to provide a complete mapping system and demonstrate the generalization ability using different sensor setup in an unseen city.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Robotics (T-RO), 2022</p></details> |
| **[Phase-SLAM: Phase Based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping for Mobile Structured Light Illumination Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09048v1)** | 2022-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Structured Light Illumination (SLI) systems have been used for reliable indoor dense 3D scanning via phase triangulation. However, mobile SLI systems for 360 degree 3D reconstruction demand 3D point cloud registration, involving high computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a phase based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (Phase-SLAM) framework for fast and accurate SLI sensor pose estimation and 3D object reconstruction. The novelty of this work is threefold: (1) developing a reprojection model from 3D points to 2D phase data towards phase registration with low computational complexity; (2) developing a local optimizer to achieve SLI sensor pose estimation (odometry) using the derived Jacobian matrix for the 6 DoF variables; (3) developing a compressive phase comparison method to achieve high-efficiency loop closure detection. The whole Phase-SLAM pipeline is then exploited using existing global pose graph optimization techniques. We build datasets from both the unreal simulation platform and a robotic arm based SLI system in real-world to verify the proposed approach. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed Phase-SLAM outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in terms of the efficiency and accuracy of pose estimation and 3D reconstruction.

However, it is still challenging to achieve high-level performance based on previously trained models in different geographical regions. This paper addresses the problem of their deployment with simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) systems in the new environment. The general baseline approach uses additional information, such as GPS, sequential keyframes tracking, and re-training the whole environment to enhance the recall rate. We propose a novel approach for improving image retrieval based on previously trained models. We present an intelligent method, MAQBOOL, to amplify the power of pre-trained models for better image recall and its application to real-time multiagent SLAM systems. We achieve comparable image retrieval results at a low descriptor dimension (512-D), compared to the high descriptor dimension (4096-D) of state-of-the-art methods. We use spatial information to improve the recall rate in image retrieval on pre-trained models.</p></details> |  |

Thus, in the proposed article, we propose a single network for global and local feature extraction in contrast to our previous work (FILD), while an exhaustive search for the verification process is adopted over the generated deep local features avoiding the utilization of hash codes. Exhaustive experiments on eleven publicly available datasets exhibit the system's high performance (achieving the highest recall score on eight of them) and low execution times (22.05 ms on average in New College, which is the largest one containing 52480 images) compared to other state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to Journal of Field Robotics</p></details> |
| **[A Universal LiDAR SLAM Accelerator System on Low-cost FPGA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.09523v2)** | 2021-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) serves as a basis for indoor cleaning, navigation, and many other useful applications in both industry and household. From a series of LiDAR scans, it constructs an accurate, globally consistent model of the environment and estimates a robot position inside it. SLAM is inherently computationally intensive; it is a challenging problem to realize a fast and reliable SLAM system on mobile robots with a limited processing capability. To overcome such hurdles, in this paper, we propose a universal, low-power, and resource-efficient accelerator design for 2D LiDAR SLAM targeting resource-limited FPGAs. As scan matching is at the heart of SLAM, the proposed accelerator consists of dedicated scan matching cores on the programmable logic part, and provides software interfaces to facilitate the use. Our accelerator can be integrated to various SLAM methods including the ROS (Robot Operating System)-based ones, and users can switch to a different method without modifying and re-synthesizing the logic part. We integrate the accelerator into three widely-used methods, i.e., scan matching, particle filter, and graph-based SLAM. We evaluate the design in terms of resource utilization, speed, and quality of output results using real-world datasets. Experiment results on a Pynq-Z2 board demonstrate that our design accelerates scan matching and loop-closure detection tasks by up to 14.84x and 18.92x, yielding 4.67x, 4.00x, and 4.06x overall performance improvement in the above methods, respectively. Our design enables the real-time performance while consuming only 2.4W and maintaining accuracy, which is comparable to the software counterparts and even the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

While the problem becomes considerably more challenging when matching should be done jointly across multiple, multimodal sets of data, the robustness and accuracy of matching in the presence of noise and outliers can be greatly improved in this setting. At present, multimodal techniques do not leverage multiway information, and multiway techniques do not incorporate different modalities, leading to inferior results. In contrast, we present a principled mixed-integer quadratic framework to address this issue. We use a novel continuous relaxation in a projected gradient descent algorithm that guarantees feasible solutions of the integer program are obtained efficiently. We demonstrate experimentally that correspondences obtained from our approach are more stable to noise and errors than state-of-the-art techniques. Tested on a robotics dataset, our algorithm resulted in a 35% increase in F1 score when compared to the best alternative.</p></details> | <details><summary>prese...</summary><p>presented in ICRA 2021 Workshop on Robust Perception for Autonomous Field Robots in Challenging Environments</p></details> |

We propose Deep Scan Context (DSC), a general and discriminative global descriptor that captures the relationship among segments of a point cloud. Unlike previous methods that utilize either semantics or a sequence of adjacent point clouds for better place recognition, we only use raw point clouds to get competitive results. Concretely, we first segment the point cloud egocentrically to acquire centroids and eigenvalues of the segments. Then, we introduce a graph neural network to aggregate these features into an embedding representation. Extensive experiments conducted on the KITTI dataset show that DSC is robust to scene variants and outperforms existing methods.</p></details> |  |

In this article, we first present the online construction of a topological map and the implementation of a control law for guiding the robot to the nearest unexplored area, first presented in [1]. The proposed method operates by allowing the robot to localize itself on a partially constructed map, calculate a path to unexplored parts of the environment (frontiers), compute a robust terminating condition when the robot has fully explored the environment, and achieve loop closure detection. The proposed algorithm results in smooth safe paths for the robot's navigation needs. The presented approach is any time algorithm that has the advantage that it allows for the active creation of topological maps from laser scan data, as it is being acquired. We also propose a navigation strategy based on a heuristic where the robot is directed towards nodes in the topological map that open to empty space. We then extend the work in [1] by presenting a topology matching algorithm that leverages the strengths of a particular spectral correspondence method [2], to match the mapped environments generated from our topology-making algorithm. Here, we concentrated on implementing a system that could be used to match the topologies of the mapped environment by using AOF Skeletons. In topology matching between two given maps and their AOF skeletons, we first find correspondences between points on the AOF skeletons of two different environments. We then align the (2D) points of the environments themselves. We also compute a distance measure between two given environments, based on their extracted AOF skeletons and their topology, as the sum of the matching errors between corresponding points.</p></details> |  |

Many state-of-the-art loop closure detection (LCD) algorithms use visual Bag-of-Words (vBoW), which is robust against partial occlusions in a scene but cannot perceive the semantics or spatial relationships between feature points. CNN object extraction can address those issues, by providing semantic labels and spatial relationships between objects in a scene. Previous work has mainly focused on replacing vBoW with CNN-derived features. In this paper, we propose SymbioLCD, a novel ensemble-based LCD that utilizes both CNN-extracted objects and vBoW features for LCD candidate prediction. When used in tandem, the added elements of object semantics and spatial-awareness create a more robust and symbiotic loop closure detection system. The proposed SymbioLCD uses scale-invariant spatial and semantic matching, Hausdorff distance with temporal constraints, and a Random Forest that utilizes combined information from both CNN-extracted objects and vBoW features for predicting accurate loop closure candidates. Evaluation of the proposed method shows it outperforms other Machine Learning (ML) algorithms - such as SVM, Decision Tree and Neural Network, and demonstrates that there is a strong symbiosis between CNN-extracted object information and vBoW features which assists accurate LCD candidate prediction. Furthermore, it is able to perceive loop closure candidates earlier than state-of-the-art SLAM algorithms, utilizing added spatial and semantic information from CNN-extracted objects.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages.

Contrarily to urban or man-made environments, where the presence of unique objects and structures offer unique cues for localization, the appearance of unstructured natural environments is often ambiguous and self-similar, hindering the performances of loop closure detection. In this paper, we present an approach to improve the robustness of place recognition in the context of a submap-based stereo SLAM based on Gaussian Process Gradient Maps (GPGMaps). GPGMaps embed a continuous representation of the gradients of the local terrain elevation by means of Gaussian Process regression and Structured Kernel Interpolation, given solely noisy elevation measurements. We leverage the image-like structure of GPGMaps to detect loop closures using traditional visual features and Bag of Words. GPGMap matching is performed as an SE(2) alignment to establish loop closure constraints within a pose graph. We evaluate the proposed pipeline on a variety of datasets recorded on Mt. Etna, Sicily and in the Morocco desert, respectively Moon- and Mars-like environments, and we compare the localization performances with state-of-the-art approaches for visual SLAM and visual loop closure detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submission to Field Robotics (www.journalfieldrobotics.org), under review</p></details> |

While significant progress has been made through this track, under more challenging configuration for monocular VSLAM, e.g., varying illumination, the performance of state-of-the-art systems generally degrades. As a consequence, robustness and accuracy for monocular VSLAM are still widely concerned. This paper presents a monocular VSLAM system that fully exploits learnt features for better state estimation. The proposed system leverages both learnt local features and global embeddings at different modules of the system: direct camera pose estimation, inter-frame feature association, and loop closure detection. With a probabilistic explanation of keypoint prediction, we formulate the camera pose tracking in a direct manner and parameterize local features with uncertainty taken into account. To alleviate the quantization effect, we adapt the mapping module to generate 3D landmarks better to guarantee the system's robustness. Detecting temporal loop closure via deep global embeddings further improves the robustness and accuracy of the proposed system. The proposed system is extensively evaluated on public datasets (Tsukuba, EuRoC, and KITTI), and compared against the state-of-the-art methods. The competitive performance of camera pose estimation confirms the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Auton...</summary><p>Autonomous Robots; 14 pages, 9 figures; project homepage: https://hyhuang1995.github.io/dgvslam/</p></details> |

As one of the most effective and efficient solutions, Bag-of-Words (BoW) builds a visual vocabulary to associate features and then detect loops. Most existing approaches that build vocabularies off-line determine scales of the vocabulary by trial-and-error, which often results in unreasonable feature association. Moreover, the accuracy of the algorithm usually declines due to perceptual aliasing, as the BoW-based method ignores the positions of visual features. To overcome these disadvantages, we propose a natural convergence criterion based on the comparison between the radii of nodes and the drifts of feature descriptors, which is then utilized to build the optimal vocabulary automatically. Furthermore, we present a novel topological graph verification method for validating candidate loops so that geometrical positions of the words can be involved with a negligible increase in complexity, which can significantly improve the accuracy of LCD. Experiments on various public datasets and comparisons against several state-of-the-art algorithms verify the performance of our proposed approach.</p></details> | 11 pages, 9 figures |

Recently, probabilistic localization systems utilizing appearance-invariant visual place recognition (VPR) methods as the primary exteroceptive sensor have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in the presence of substantial appearance change. However, existing systems 1) do not fully utilize odometry data within the motion models, and 2) are unable to handle route deviations, due to the assumption that query traverses exactly repeat the mapping traverse. To address these shortcomings, we present a new probabilistic topometric localization system which incorporates full 3-dof odometry into the motion model and furthermore, adds an "off-map" state within the state-estimation framework, allowing query traverses which feature significant route detours from the reference map to be successfully localized. We perform extensive evaluation on multiple query traverses from the Oxford RobotCar dataset exhibiting both significant appearance change and deviations from routes previously traversed. In particular, we evaluate performance on two practically relevant localization tasks: loop closure detection and global localization. Our approach achieves major performance improvements over both existing and improved state-of-the-art systems.</p></details> | 8 pages |

In some cases, a robot needs to work in the same environment. Such applications give rise to the problem of a life-long SLAM system. Life-long SLAM presents two main challenges i.e. the tracking should not fail in a dynamic environment and the need for a robust and efficient mapping strategy. The system should update maps with new information; while also keeping track of older observations. But, mapping for a long time can require higher computational requirements. In this paper, we propose a solution to the problem of life-long SLAM. We represent the global map as a set of rasterized images of local maps along with a map management system responsible for updating local maps and keeping track of older values. We also present an efficient approach of using the bag of visual words method for loop closure detection and relocalization. We evaluate the performance of our system on the KITTI dataset and an indoor dataset. Our loop closure system reported recall and precision of above 90 percent. The computational cost of our system is much lower as compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our method reports lower computational requirements even for long-term operation.</p></details> |  |

With the development of 3D semantic segmentation for point cloud, semantic information can be obtained conveniently and steadily, essential for high-level intelligence and conductive to SLAM. In this paper, we present a novel semantic-aided LiDAR SLAM with loop closure based on LOAM, named SA-LOAM, which leverages semantics in odometry as well as loop closure detection. Specifically, we propose a semantic-assisted ICP, including semantically matching, downsampling and plane constraint, and integrates a semantic graph-based place recognition method in our loop closure detection module. Benefitting from semantics, we can improve the localization accuracy, detect loop closures effectively, and construct a global consistent semantic map even in large-scale scenes.

| **[Distillation Improves Visual Place Recognition for Low Quality Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06906v3)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time visual localization often utilizes online computing, for which query images or videos are transmitted to remote servers for visual place recognition (VPR). However, limited network bandwidth necessitates image-quality reduction and thus the degradation of global image descriptors, reducing VPR accuracy. We address this issue at the descriptor extraction level with a knowledge-distillation methodology that learns feature representations from high-quality images to extract more discriminative descriptors from low-quality images. Our approach includes the Inter-channel Correlation Knowledge Distillation (ICKD) loss, Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss, and Triplet loss. We validate the proposed losses on multiple VPR methods and datasets subjected to JPEG compression, resolution reduction, and video quantization. We obtain significant improvements in VPR recall rates under all three tested modalities of lowered image quality. Furthermore, we fill a gap in VPR literature on video-based data and its influence on VPR performance. This work contributes to more reliable place recognition in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[StructVPR++: Distill Structural and Semantic Knowledge with Weighting Samples for Visual Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06601v2)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual place recognition is a challenging task for autonomous driving and robotics, which is usually considered as an image retrieval problem. A commonly used two-stage strategy involves global retrieval followed by re-ranking using patch-level descriptors. Most deep learning-based methods in an end-to-end manner cannot extract global features with sufficient semantic information from RGB images. In contrast, re-ranking can utilize more explicit structural and semantic information in one-to-one matching process, but it is time-consuming. To bridge the gap between global retrieval and re-ranking and achieve a good trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, we propose StructVPR++, a framework that embeds structural and semantic knowledge into RGB global representations via segmentation-guided distillation. Our key innovation lies in decoupling label-specific features from global descriptors, enabling explicit semantic alignment between image pairs without requiring segmentation during deployment. Furthermore, we introduce a sample-wise weighted distillation strategy that prioritizes reliable training pairs while suppressing noisy ones. Experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that StructVPR++ surpasses state-of-the-art global methods by 5-23% in Recall@1 and even outperforms many two-stage approaches, achieving real-time efficiency with a single RGB input.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by T-PAMI2025</p></details> |

However, most existing VPR datasets are limited to single-viewpoint scenarios, leading to reduced recognition accuracy, particularly in multi-directional driving or feature-sparse scenes. Moreover, obtaining additional data to mitigate these limitations is often expensive. This paper introduces a novel training paradigm to improve the performance of existing VPR networks by enhancing multi-view diversity within current datasets through uncertainty estimation and NeRF-based data augmentation. Specifically, we initially train NeRF using the existing VPR dataset. Then, our devised self-supervised uncertainty estimation network identifies places with high uncertainty. The poses of these uncertain places are input into NeRF to generate new synthetic observations for further training of VPR networks. Additionally, we propose an improved storage method for efficient organization of augmented and original training data. We conducted extensive experiments on three datasets and tested three different VPR backbone networks. The results demonstrate that our proposed training paradigm significantly improves VPR performance by fully utilizing existing data, outperforming other training approaches. We further validated the effectiveness of our approach on self-recorded indoor and outdoor datasets, consistently demonstrating superior results.

NuRF leverages recent advancements in radiance fields and visual place recognition. Conventional visual place recognition meets the challenges of data sparsity and artifact-induced inaccuracies. By utilizing radiance field-generated novel views, NuRF enhances visual localization performance and combines coarse global localization with the fine-grained pose tracking of a particle filter, ensuring continuous and precise localization. Experimentally, our method converges 7 times faster than existing Monte Carlo-based methods and achieves localization accuracy within 1 meter, offering an efficient and resilient solution for indoor visual localization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for Publication in IEEE Transactions on Cognitive and Developmental Systems</p></details> |

Our paper highlights three advancements for SNNs in Visual Place Recognition (VPR). Firstly, we propose Modular SNNs, where each SNN represents a set of non-overlapping geographically distinct places, enabling scalable networks for large environments. Secondly, we present Ensembles of Modular SNNs, where multiple networks represent the same place, significantly enhancing accuracy compared to single-network models. Each of our Modular SNN modules is compact, comprising only 1500 neurons and 474k synapses, making them ideally suited for ensembling due to their small size. Lastly, we investigate the role of sequence matching in SNN-based VPR, a technique where consecutive images are used to refine place recognition. We demonstrate competitive performance of our method on a range of datasets, including higher responsiveness to ensembling compared to conventional VPR techniques and higher R@1 improvements with sequence matching than VPR techniques with comparable baseline performance. Our contributions highlight the viability of SNNs for VPR, offering scalable and robust solutions, and paving the way for their application in various energy-sensitive robotic tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 10 figures, IEEE Transactions on Robotics (TRO)</p></details> |

Existing visual place recognition (VPR) methods, which typically rely on global descriptors or aggregate local features, often struggle in cluttered indoor environments densely populated with man-made objects. These methods tend to overlook the crucial role of object-oriented information. To address this, we propose AirRoom, an object-aware pipeline that integrates multi-level object-oriented information-from global context to object patches, object segmentation, and keypoints-utilizing a coarse-to-fine retrieval approach. Extensive experiments on four newly constructed datasets-MPReID, HMReID, GibsonReID, and ReplicaReID-demonstrate that AirRoom outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) models across nearly all evaluation metrics, with improvements ranging from 6% to 80%. Moreover, AirRoom exhibits significant flexibility, allowing various modules within the pipeline to be substituted with different alternatives without compromising overall performance. It also shows robust and consistent performance under diverse viewpoint variations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted at CVPR 2025</p></details> |

One of the possible approaches suitable for such environments is appearance-based teach-and-repeat navigation, relying on simplified localization and reactive robot motion control - all without a need for standard mapping. This work brings an innovative solution to such a system based on visual place recognition techniques. Here, the major contributions stand in the employment of a new visual place recognition technique, a novel horizontal shift computation approach, and a multi-platform system design for applications across various types of mobile robots. Secondly, a new public dataset for experimental testing of appearance-based navigation methods is introduced. Moreover, the work also provides real-world experimental testing and performance comparison of the introduced navigation system against other state-of-the-art methods. The results confirm that the new system outperforms existing methods in several testing scenarios, is capable of operation indoors and outdoors, and exhibits robustness to day and night scene variations.</p></details> | 6 pages, 5 figures |
| **[CQVPR: Landmark-aware Contextual Queries for Visual Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08170v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Place Recognition (VPR) aims to estimate the location of the given query image within a database of geo-tagged images. To identify the exact location in an image, detecting landmarks is crucial. However, in some scenarios, such as urban environments, there are numerous landmarks, such as various modern buildings, and the landmarks in different cities often exhibit high visual similarity. Therefore, it is essential not only to leverage the landmarks but also to consider the contextual information surrounding them, such as whether there are trees, roads, or other features around the landmarks. We propose the Contextual Query VPR (CQVPR), which integrates contextual information with detailed pixel-level visual features. By leveraging a set of learnable contextual queries, our method automatically learns the high-level contexts with respect to landmarks and their surrounding areas. Heatmaps depicting regions that each query attends to serve as context-aware features, offering cues that could enhance the understanding of each scene. We further propose a query matching loss to supervise the extraction process of contextual queries. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, especially in challenging scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Visual Place Recognition with Sequence-Matching Receptiveness Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06840v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In visual place recognition (VPR), filtering and sequence-based matching approaches can improve performance by integrating temporal information across image sequences, especially in challenging conditions. While these methods are commonly applied, their effects on system behavior can be unpredictable and can actually make performance worse in certain situations. In this work, we present a new supervised learning approach that learns to predict the per-frame sequence matching receptiveness (SMR) of VPR techniques, enabling the system to selectively decide when to trust the output of a sequence matching system. The approach is agnostic to the underlying VPR technique. Our approach predicts SMR-and hence significantly improves VPR performance-across a large range of state-of-the-art and classical VPR techniques (namely CosPlace, MixVPR, EigenPlaces, SALAD, AP-GeM, NetVLAD and SAD), and across three benchmark VPR datasets (Nordland, Oxford RobotCar, and SFU-Mountain). We also provide insights into a complementary approach that uses the predictor to replace discarded matches, as well as ablation studies, including an analysis of the interactions between our SMR predictor and the selected sequence length. We will release our code upon acceptance.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, under review</p></details> |
| **[TextInPlace: Indoor Visual Place Recognition in Repetitive Structures with Scene Text Spotting and Verification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06501v1)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is a crucial capability for long-term autonomous robots, enabling them to identify previously visited locations using visual information. However, existing methods remain limited in indoor settings due to the highly repetitive structures inherent in such environments. We observe that scene text typically appears in indoor spaces, serving to distinguish visually similar but different places. This inspires us to propose TextInPlace, a simple yet effective VPR framework that integrates Scene Text Spotting (STS) to mitigate visual perceptual ambiguity in repetitive indoor environments. Specifically, TextInPlace adopts a dual-branch architecture within a local parameter sharing network. The VPR branch employs attention-based aggregation to extract global descriptors for coarse-grained retrieval, while the STS branch utilizes a bridging text spotter to detect and recognize scene text. Finally, the discriminative text is filtered to compute text similarity and re-rank the top-K retrieved images. To bridge the gap between current text-based repetitive indoor scene datasets and the typical scenarios encountered in robot navigation, we establish an indoor VPR benchmark dataset, called Maze-with-Text. Extensive experiments on both custom and public datasets demonstrate that TextInPlace achieves superior performance over existing methods that rely solely on appearance information. The dataset, code, and trained models are publicly available at https://github.com/HqiTao/TextInPlace.</p></details> | 8 pages,5 figures |
| **[Bridging Text and Vision: A Multi-View Text-Vision Registration Approach for Cross-Modal Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14195v2)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mobile robots necessitate advanced natural language understanding capabilities to accurately identify locations and perform tasks such as package delivery. However, traditional visual place recognition (VPR) methods rely solely on single-view visual information and cannot interpret human language descriptions. To overcome this challenge, we bridge text and vision by proposing a multiview (360{\deg} views of the surroundings) text-vision registration approach called Text4VPR for place recognition task, which is the first method that exclusively utilizes textual descriptions to match a database of images. Text4VPR employs the frozen T5 language model to extract global textual embeddings. Additionally, it utilizes the Sinkhorn algorithm with temperature coefficient to assign local tokens to their respective clusters, thereby aggregating visual descriptors from images. During the training stage, Text4VPR emphasizes the alignment between individual text-image pairs for precise textual description. In the inference stage, Text4VPR uses the Cascaded Cross-Attention Cosine Alignment (CCCA) to address the internal mismatch between text and image groups. Subsequently, Text4VPR performs precisely place match based on the descriptions of text-image groups. On Street360Loc, the first text to image VPR dataset we created, Text4VPR builds a robust baseline, achieving a leading top-1 accuracy of 57% and a leading top-10 accuracy of 92% within a 5-meter radius on the test set, which indicates that localization from textual descriptions to images is not only feasible but also holds significant potential for further advancement, as shown in Figure 1.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, conference</p></details> |

However, automating underwater ecosystem management with robotic platforms remains challenging due to the complexities of underwater imagery, which pose significant difficulties for traditional visual localization methods. We propose an integrated pipeline that combines Visual Place Recognition (VPR), feature matching, and image segmentation on video-derived images. This method enables robust identification of revisited areas, estimation of rigid transformations, and downstream analysis of ecosystem changes. Furthermore, we introduce the SQUIDLE+ VPR Benchmark-the first large-scale underwater VPR benchmark designed to leverage an extensive collection of unstructured data from multiple robotic platforms, spanning time intervals from days to years. The dataset encompasses diverse trajectories, arbitrary overlap and diverse seafloor types captured under varying environmental conditions, including differences in depth, lighting, and turbidity.

| **[TeTRA-VPR: A Ternary Transformer Approach for Compact Visual Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02511v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Place Recognition (VPR) localizes a query image by matching it against a database of geo-tagged reference images, making it essential for navigation and mapping in robotics. Although Vision Transformer (ViT) solutions deliver high accuracy, their large models often exceed the memory and compute budgets of resource-constrained platforms such as drones and mobile robots. To address this issue, we propose TeTRA, a ternary transformer approach that progressively quantizes the ViT backbone to 2-bit precision and binarizes its final embedding layer, offering substantial reductions in model size and latency. A carefully designed progressive distillation strategy preserves the representational power of a full-precision teacher, allowing TeTRA to retain or even surpass the accuracy of uncompressed convolutional counterparts, despite using fewer resources. Experiments on standard VPR benchmarks demonstrate that TeTRA reduces memory consumption by up to 69% compared to efficient baselines, while lowering inference latency by 35%, with either no loss or a slight improvement in recall@1. These gains enable high-accuracy VPR on power-constrained, memory-limited robotic platforms, making TeTRA an appealing solution for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Continual Multi-Robot Learning from Black-Box Visual Place Recognition Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02256v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the context of visual place recognition (VPR), continual learning (CL) techniques offer significant potential for avoiding catastrophic forgetting when learning new places. However, existing CL methods often focus on knowledge transfer from a known model to a new one, overlooking the existence of unknown black-box models. We explore a novel multi-robot CL approach that enables knowledge transfer from black-box VPR models (teachers), such as those of local robots encountered by traveler robots (students) in unknown environments. Specifically, we introduce Membership Inference Attack, or MIA, the only major privacy attack applicable to black-box models, and leverage it to reconstruct pseudo training sets, which serve as the key knowledge to be exchanged between robots, from black-box VPR models. Furthermore, we aim to overcome the inherently low sampling efficiency of MIA by leveraging insights on place class prediction distribution and un-learned class detection imported from the VPR literature as a prior distribution. We also analyze both the individual effects of these methods and their combined impact. Experimental results demonstrate that our black-box MIA (BB-MIA) approach is remarkably powerful despite its simplicity, significantly enhancing the VPR capability of lower-performing robots through brief communication with other robots. This study contributes to optimizing knowledge sharing between robots in VPR and enhancing autonomy in open-world environments with multi-robot systems that are fault-tolerant and scalable.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, technical report</p></details> |

The pair classifier can predict whether a given pair of images are from the same place or not. The network only comprises Vision Transformer components for both the encoder and the pair classifier, and both components are trained using their respective class tokens. In existing VPR methods, typically the network is initialized using pre-trained weights from a generic image dataset such as ImageNet. In this work we propose an alternative pre-training strategy, by using Siamese Masked Image Modelling as a pre-training task. We propose a Place-aware image sampling procedure from a collection of large VPR datasets for pre-training our model, to learn visual features tuned specifically for VPR. By re-using the Mask Image Modelling encoder and decoder weights in the second stage of training, Pair-VPR can achieve state-of-the-art VPR performance across five benchmark datasets with a ViT-B encoder, along with further improvements in localization recall with larger encoders.

Compared to single-modal VPR, this approach benefits from the widespread availability of RGB cameras and the robustness of point clouds in providing accurate spatial geometry and distance information. However, current methods rely on intermediate modalities that capture either the vertical or horizontal field of view, limiting their ability to fully exploit the complementary information from both sensors. In this work, we propose an innovative initial retrieval + re-rank method that effectively combines information from range (or RGB) images and Bird's Eye View (BEV) images. Our approach relies solely on a computationally efficient global descriptor similarity search process to achieve re-ranking. Additionally, we introduce a novel similarity label supervision technique to maximize the utility of limited training data. Specifically, we employ points average distance to approximate appearance similarity and incorporate an adaptive margin, based on similarity differences, into the vanilla triplet loss. Experimental results on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[SciceVPR: Stable Cross-Image Correlation Enhanced Model for Visual Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20676v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is a major challenge for robotics and autonomous systems, with the goal of predicting the location of an image based solely on its visual features. State-of-the-art (SOTA) models extract global descriptors using the powerful foundation model DINOv2 as backbone. These models either explore the cross-image correlation or propose a time-consuming two-stage re-ranking strategy to achieve better performance. However, existing works only utilize the final output of DINOv2, and the current cross-image correlation causes unstable retrieval results. To produce both discriminative and constant global descriptors, this paper proposes stable cross-image correlation enhanced model for VPR called SciceVPR. This model explores the full potential of DINOv2 in providing useful feature representations that implicitly encode valuable contextual knowledge. Specifically, SciceVPR first uses a multi-layer feature fusion module to capture increasingly detailed task-relevant channel and spatial information from the multi-layer output of DINOv2. Secondly, SciceVPR considers the invariant correlation between images within a batch as valuable knowledge to be distilled into the proposed self-enhanced encoder. In this way, SciceVPR can acquire fairly robust global features regardless of domain shifts (e.g., changes in illumination, weather and viewpoint between pictures taken in the same place). Experimental results demonstrate that the base variant, SciceVPR-B, outperforms SOTA one-stage methods with single input on multiple datasets with varying domain conditions. The large variant, SciceVPR-L, performs on par with SOTA two-stage models, scoring over 3% higher in Recall@1 compared to existing models on the challenging Tokyo24/7 dataset. Our code will be released at https://github.com/shuimushan/SciceVPR.</p></details> |  |

However, existing solutions are built to specifically work for one of these tasks, and are known to fail when the requirements slightly change or when they meet out-of-distribution data. In this paper we combine a variety of existing methods, training techniques, and datasets to train a retrieval model, called MegaLoc, that is performant on multiple tasks. We find that MegaLoc (1) achieves state of the art on a large number of Visual Place Recognition datasets, (2) impressive results on common Landmark Retrieval datasets, and (3) sets a new state of the art for Visual Localization on the LaMAR datasets, where we only changed the retrieval method to the existing localization pipeline.

In our previous work, we propose a novel method to realize seamless adaptation of foundation models to VPR (SelaVPR). This method can produce both global and local features that focus on discriminative landmarks to recognize places for two-stage VPR by a parameter-efficient adaptation approach. Although SelaVPR has achieved competitive results, we argue that the previous adaptation is inefficient in training time and GPU memory usage, and the re-ranking paradigm is also costly in retrieval latency and storage usage. In pursuit of higher efficiency and better performance, we propose an extension of the SelaVPR, called SelaVPR++. Concretely, we first design a parameter-, time-, and memory-efficient adaptation method that uses lightweight multi-scale convolution (MultiConv) adapters to refine intermediate features from the frozen foundation backbone. This adaptation method does not back-propagate gradients through the backbone during training, and the MultiConv adapter facilitates feature interactions along the spatial axes and introduces proper local priors, thus achieving higher efficiency and better performance. Moreover, we propose an innovative re-ranking paradigm for more efficient VPR. Instead of relying on local features for re-ranking, which incurs huge overhead in latency and storage, we employ compact binary features for initial retrieval and robust floating-point (global) features for re-ranking. To obtain such binary features, we propose a similarity-constrained deep hashing method, which can be easily integrated into the VPR pipeline. Finally, we improve our training strategy and unify the training protocol of several common training datasets to merge them for better training of VPR models. Extensive experiments show that ......</p></details> |  |

However, acquiring such datasets is time-consuming, costly, and sometimes unfeasible. To address these limitations, the use of synthetic data has gained attention as a viable alternative, allowing researchers to generate vast amounts of data while simulating various environmental contexts in a controlled setting. In this study, we investigate the use of synthetic data in robotics and navigation, specifically focusing on Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and Visual Place Recognition (VPR). In particular, we introduce a synthetic dataset created using the virtual environment of the video game Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V), along with an algorithm designed to generate a VPR dataset, without human supervision. Through a series of experiments centered on SLAM and VPR, we demonstrate that synthetic data derived from GTA V are qualitatively comparable to real-world data. Furthermore, these synthetic data can complement or even substitute real-world data in these applications. This study sets the stage for the creation of large-scale synthetic datasets, offering a cost-effective and scalable solution for future research and development.</p></details> |  |

It enables the systems to robustly localize themselves in large-scale environments. Existing VPR methods demonstrate attractive performance at the cost of heavy pre-training and limited generalizability. When deployed in unseen environments, these methods exhibit significant performance drops. Targeting this issue, we present VIPeR, a novel approach for visual incremental place recognition with the ability to adapt to new environments while retaining the performance of previous environments. We first introduce an adaptive mining strategy that balances the performance within a single environment and the generalizability across multiple environments. Then, to prevent catastrophic forgetting in lifelong learning, we draw inspiration from human memory systems and design a novel memory bank for our VIPeR. Our memory bank contains a sensory memory, a working memory and a long-term memory, with the first two focusing on the current environment and the last one for all previously visited environments. Additionally, we propose a probabilistic knowledge distillation to explicitly safeguard the previously learned knowledge. We evaluate our proposed VIPeR on three large-scale datasets, namely Oxford Robotcar, Nordland, and TartanAir. For comparison, we first set a baseline performance with naive finetuning. Then, several more recent lifelong learning methods are compared. Our VIPeR achieves better performance in almost all aspects with the biggest improvement of 13.65% in average performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures.

| **[Learning Street View Representations with Spatiotemporal Contrast](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04638v1)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Street view imagery is extensively utilized in representation learning for urban visual environments, supporting various sustainable development tasks such as environmental perception and socio-economic assessment. However, it is challenging for existing image representations to specifically encode the dynamic urban environment (such as pedestrians, vehicles, and vegetation), the built environment (including buildings, roads, and urban infrastructure), and the environmental ambiance (such as the cultural and socioeconomic atmosphere) depicted in street view imagery to address downstream tasks related to the city. In this work, we propose an innovative self-supervised learning framework that leverages temporal and spatial attributes of street view imagery to learn image representations of the dynamic urban environment for diverse downstream tasks. By employing street view images captured at the same location over time and spatially nearby views at the same time, we construct contrastive learning tasks designed to learn the temporal-invariant characteristics of the built environment and the spatial-invariant neighborhood ambiance. Our approach significantly outperforms traditional supervised and unsupervised methods in tasks such as visual place recognition, socioeconomic estimation, and human-environment perception. Moreover, we demonstrate the varying behaviors of image representations learned through different contrastive learning objectives across various downstream tasks. This study systematically discusses representation learning strategies for urban studies based on street view images, providing a benchmark that enhances the applicability of visual data in urban science.

We propose a strategy to align the input sensor modalities by leveraging stereo image streams to produce metric depth predictions with pose information, followed by fusing multiple scene views from a local window using a probabilistic occupancy framework to expand the limited field-of-view of the camera. Additionally, SOLVR adopts a flexible definition of what constitutes positive examples for different training losses, allowing us to simultaneously optimise place recognition and registration performance. Furthermore, we replace RANSAC with a registration function that weights a simple least-squares fitting with the estimated inlier likelihood of sparse keypoint correspondences, improving performance in scenarios with a low inlier ratio between the query and retrieved place. Our experiments on the KITTI and KITTI360 datasets show that SOLVR achieves state-of-the-art performance for LiDAR-Visual place recognition and registration, particularly improving registration accuracy over larger distances between the query and retrieved place.</p></details> | Accepted to ICRA2025 |
| **[EffoVPR: Effective Foundation Model Utilization for Visual Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18065v2)** | 2025-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The task of Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is to predict the location of a query image from a database of geo-tagged images. Recent studies in VPR have highlighted the significant advantage of employing pre-trained foundation models like DINOv2 for the VPR task. However, these models are often deemed inadequate for VPR without further fine-tuning on VPR-specific data. In this paper, we present an effective approach to harness the potential of a foundation model for VPR. We show that features extracted from self-attention layers can act as a powerful re-ranker for VPR, even in a zero-shot setting. Our method not only outperforms previous zero-shot approaches but also introduces results competitive with several supervised methods. We then show that a single-stage approach utilizing internal ViT layers for pooling can produce global features that achieve state-of-the-art performance, with impressive feature compactness down to 128D. Moreover, integrating our local foundation features for re-ranking further widens this performance gap. Our method also demonstrates exceptional robustness and generalization, setting new state-of-the-art performance, while handling challenging conditions such as occlusion, day-night transitions, and seasonal variations.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

While cost-effective and easily deployed, camera sensors are sensitive to lighting and weather changes, and even slight image alterations can greatly affect VPR efficiency and precision. Existing methods overcome this by exploiting powerful yet large networks, leading to significant consumption of computational resources. In this paper, we propose a high-performance teacher and lightweight student distillation framework called TSCM. It exploits our devised cross-metric knowledge distillation to narrow the performance gap between the teacher and student models, maintaining superior performance while enabling minimal computational load during deployment. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on large-scale datasets, namely Pittsburgh30k and Pittsburgh250k. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method over baseline models in terms of recognition accuracy and model parameter efficiency. Moreover, our ablation studies show that the proposed knowledge distillation technique surpasses other counterparts.

However, tracking loss can lead to the creation of disjoint submaps in multimap SLAM systems like ORB-SLAM3. Because of that, these systems employ submap merging strategies. As we show, these strategies are not always successful. In this paper, we investigate the impact of using modern VPR approaches for submap merging in visual SLAM. We argue that classical evaluation metrics are not sufficient to estimate the impact of a modern VPR component on the overall system. We show that naively replacing the VPR component does not leverage its full potential without requiring substantial interference in the original system. Because of that, we present a post-processing pipeline along with a set of metrics that allow us to estimate the impact of modern VPR components. We evaluate our approach on the NCLT and Newer College datasets using ORB-SLAM3 with NetVLAD and HDC-DELF as VPR components. Additionally, we present a simple approach for combining VPR with temporal consistency for map merging. We show that the map merging performance of ORB-SLAM3 can be improved. Building on these results, researchers in VPR can assess the potential of their approaches for SLAM systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at TAROS 2024.

| **[A Visual-inertial Localization Algorithm using Opportunistic Visual Beacons and Dead-Reckoning for GNSS-Denied Large-scale Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19845v2)** | 2024-12-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the development of smart cities, the demand for continuous pedestrian navigation in large-scale urban environments has significantly increased. While global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) provide low-cost and reliable positioning services, they are often hindered in complex urban canyon environments. Thus, exploring opportunistic signals for positioning in urban areas has become a key solution. Augmented reality (AR) allows pedestrians to acquire real-time visual information. Accordingly, we propose a low-cost visual-inertial positioning solution. This method comprises a lightweight multi-scale group convolution (MSGC)-based visual place recognition (VPR) neural network, a pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) algorithm, and a visual/inertial fusion approach based on a Kalman filter with gross error suppression. The VPR serves as a conditional observation to the Kalman filter, effectively correcting the errors accumulated through the PDR method. This enables the entire algorithm to ensure the reliability of long-term positioning in GNSS-denied areas. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method maintains stable positioning during large-scale movements. Compared to the lightweight MobileNetV3-based VPR method, our proposed VPR solution improves Recall@1 by at least 3\% on two public datasets while reducing the number of parameters by 63.37\%. It also achieves performance that is comparable to the VGG16-based method. The VPR-PDR algorithm improves localization accuracy by more than 40\% compared to the original PDR.</p></details> |  |
| **[MVC-VPR: Mutual Learning of Viewpoint Classification and Visual Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09199v2)** | 2024-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Place Recognition (VPR) aims to robustly identify locations by leveraging image retrieval based on descriptors encoded from environmental images. However, drastic appearance changes of images captured from different viewpoints at the same location pose incoherent supervision signals for descriptor learning, which severely hinder the performance of VPR. Previous work proposes classifying images based on manually defined rules or ground truth labels for viewpoints, followed by descriptor training based on the classification results. However, not all datasets have ground truth labels of viewpoints and manually defined rules may be suboptimal, leading to degraded descriptor performance.To address these challenges, we introduce the mutual learning of viewpoint self-classification and VPR. Starting from coarse classification based on geographical coordinates, we progress to finer classification of viewpoints using simple clustering techniques. The dataset is partitioned in an unsupervised manner while simultaneously training a descriptor extractor for place recognition. Experimental results show that this approach almost perfectly partitions the dataset based on viewpoints, thus achieving mutually reinforcing effects. Our method even excels state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods that partition datasets using ground truth labels.</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[On Motion Blur and Deblurring in Visual Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07751v1)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Place Recognition (VPR) in mobile robotics enables robots to localize themselves by recognizing previously visited locations using visual data. While the reliability of VPR methods has been extensively studied under conditions such as changes in illumination, season, weather and viewpoint, the impact of motion blur is relatively unexplored despite its relevance not only in rapid motion scenarios but also in low-light conditions where longer exposure times are necessary. Similarly, the role of image deblurring in enhancing VPR performance under motion blur has received limited attention so far. This paper bridges these gaps by introducing a new benchmark designed to evaluate VPR performance under the influence of motion blur and image deblurring. The benchmark includes three datasets that encompass a wide range of motion blur intensities, providing a comprehensive platform for analysis. Experimental results with several well-established VPR and image deblurring methods provide new insights into the effects of motion blur and the potential improvements achieved through deblurring. Building on these findings, the paper proposes adaptive deblurring strategies for VPR, designed to effectively manage motion blur in dynamic, real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Hyperdimensional One Place Signature to Represent Them All: Stackable Descriptors For Visual Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06153v1)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Place Recognition (VPR) enables coarse localization by comparing query images to a reference database of geo-tagged images. Recent breakthroughs in deep learning architectures and training regimes have led to methods with improved robustness to factors like environment appearance change, but with the downside that the required training and/or matching compute scales with the number of distinct environmental conditions encountered. Here, we propose Hyperdimensional One Place Signatures (HOPS) to simultaneously improve the performance, compute and scalability of these state-of-the-art approaches by fusing the descriptors from multiple reference sets captured under different conditions. HOPS scales to any number of environmental conditions by leveraging the Hyperdimensional Computing framework. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our approach is highly generalizable and consistently improves recall performance across all evaluated VPR methods and datasets by large margins. Arbitrarily fusing reference images without compute penalty enables numerous other useful possibilities, three of which we demonstrate here: descriptor dimensionality reduction with no performance penalty, stacking synthetic images, and coarse localization to an entire traverse or environmental section.</p></details> | Under Review |

However, existing reviews predominantly concentrate on visual place recognition (VPR) methods. Despite the recent remarkable progress in LPR, to the best of our knowledge, there is no dedicated systematic review in this area. This paper bridges the gap by providing a comprehensive review of place recognition methods employing LiDAR sensors, thus facilitating and encouraging further research. We commence by delving into the problem formulation of place recognition, exploring existing challenges, and describing relations to previous surveys. Subsequently, we conduct an in-depth review of related research, which offers detailed classifications, strengths and weaknesses, and architectures. Finally, we summarize existing datasets, commonly used evaluation metrics, and comprehensive evaluation results from various methods on public datasets. This paper can serve as a valuable tutorial for newcomers entering the field of place recognition and for researchers interested in long-term robot localization.

| **[Distillation of Diffusion Features for Semantic Correspondence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03512v1)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic correspondence, the task of determining relationships between different parts of images, underpins various applications including 3D reconstruction, image-to-image translation, object tracking, and visual place recognition. Recent studies have begun to explore representations learned in large generative image models for semantic correspondence, demonstrating promising results. Building on this progress, current state-of-the-art methods rely on combining multiple large models, resulting in high computational demands and reduced efficiency. In this work, we address this challenge by proposing a more computationally efficient approach. We propose a novel knowledge distillation technique to overcome the problem of reduced efficiency. We show how to use two large vision foundation models and distill the capabilities of these complementary models into one smaller model that maintains high accuracy at reduced computational cost. Furthermore, we demonstrate that by incorporating 3D data, we are able to further improve performance, without the need for human-annotated correspondences. Overall, our empirical results demonstrate that our distilled model with 3D data augmentation achieves performance superior to current state-of-the-art methods while significantly reducing computational load and enhancing practicality for real-world applications, such as semantic video correspondence.

| **[Breaking the Frame: Visual Place Recognition by Overlap Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16204v3)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual place recognition methods struggle with occlusions and partial visual overlaps. We propose a novel visual place recognition approach based on overlap prediction, called VOP, shifting from traditional reliance on global image similarities and local features to image overlap prediction. VOP proceeds co-visible image sections by obtaining patch-level embeddings using a Vision Transformer backbone and establishing patch-to-patch correspondences without requiring expensive feature detection and matching. Our approach uses a voting mechanism to assess overlap scores for potential database images. It provides a nuanced image retrieval metric in challenging scenarios. Experimental results show that VOP leads to more accurate relative pose estimation and localization results on the retrieved image pairs than state-of-the-art baselines on a number of large-scale, real-world indoor and outdoor benchmarks.

| **[EDTformer: An Efficient Decoder Transformer for Visual Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00784v1)** | 2024-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual place recognition (VPR) aims to determine the general geographical location of a query image by retrieving visually similar images from a large geo-tagged database. To obtain a global representation for each place image, most approaches typically focus on the aggregation of deep features extracted from a backbone through using current prominent architectures (e.g., CNNs, MLPs, pooling layer and transformer encoder), giving little attention to the transformer decoder. However, we argue that its strong capability in capturing contextual dependencies and generating accurate features holds considerable potential for the VPR task. To this end, we propose an Efficient Decoder Transformer (EDTformer) for feature aggregation, which consists of several stacked simplified decoder blocks followed by two linear layers to directly generate robust and discriminative global representations for VPR. Specifically, we do this by formulating deep features as the keys and values, as well as a set of independent learnable parameters as the queries. EDTformer can fully utilize the contextual information within deep features, then gradually decode and aggregate the effective features into the learnable queries to form the final global representations. Moreover, to provide powerful deep features for EDTformer and further facilitate the robustness, we use the foundation model DINOv2 as the backbone and propose a Low-Rank Parallel Adaptation (LoPA) method to enhance it, which can refine the intermediate features of the backbone progressively in a memory- and parameter-efficient way. As a result, our method not only outperforms single-stage VPR methods on multiple benchmark datasets, but also outperforms two-stage VPR methods which add a re-ranking with considerable cost. Code will be available at https://github.com/Tong-Jin01/EDTformer.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures |

A scene representation is either metric, such as landmark maps in 3D reconstruction, 3D bounding boxes in object detection, or voxel grids in occupancy prediction, or topological, such as pose graphs with loop closures in SLAM or visibility graphs in SfM. In this work, we propose to build Multiview Scene Graphs (MSG) from unposed images, representing a scene topologically with interconnected place and object nodes. The task of building MSG is challenging for existing representation learning methods since it needs to jointly address both visual place recognition, object detection, and object association from images with limited fields of view and potentially large viewpoint changes. To evaluate any method tackling this task, we developed an MSG dataset and annotation based on a public 3D dataset. We also propose an evaluation metric based on the intersection-over-union score of MSG edges. Moreover, we develop a novel baseline method built on mainstream pretrained vision models, combining visual place recognition and object association into one Transformer decoder architecture. Experiments demonstrate that our method has superior performance compared to existing relevant baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024.

| **[Self-Supervised Place Recognition by Refining Temporal and Featural Pseudo Labels from Panoramic Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.09315v3)** | 2024-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual place recognition (VPR) using deep networks has achieved state-of-the-art performance. However, most of them require a training set with ground truth sensor poses to obtain positive and negative samples of each observation's spatial neighborhood for supervised learning. When such information is unavailable, temporal neighborhoods from a sequentially collected data stream could be exploited for self-supervised training, although we find its performance suboptimal. Inspired by noisy label learning, we propose a novel self-supervised framework named TF-VPR that uses temporal neighborhoods and learnable feature neighborhoods to discover unknown spatial neighborhoods. Our method follows an iterative training paradigm which alternates between: (1) representation learning with data augmentation, (2) positive set expansion to include the current feature space neighbors, and (3) positive set contraction via geometric verification. We conduct auto-labeling and generalization tests on both simulated and real datasets, with either RGB images or point clouds as inputs. The results show that our method outperforms self-supervised baselines in recall rate, robustness, and heading diversity, a novel metric we propose for VPR.

Previously, SVM classifiers have been used to monitor VPR integrity. This research introduces a novel Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) integrity monitor which demonstrates improved performance and generalizability, removing per-environment training and reducing manual tuning requirements. We test our proposed system in extensive real-world experiments, presenting two real-time integrity-based VPR verification methods: a single-query rejection method for robot navigation to a goal zone (Experiment 1); and a history-of-queries method that takes a best, verified, match from its recent trajectory and uses an odometer to extrapolate a current position estimate (Experiment 2). Noteworthy results for Experiment 1 include a decrease in aggregate mean along-track goal error from ~9.8m to ~3.1m, and an increase in the aggregate rate of successful mission completion from ~41% to ~55%. Experiment 2 showed a decrease in aggregate mean along-track localization error from ~2.0m to ~0.5m, and an increase in the aggregate localization precision from ~97% to ~99%.

In this paper, we introduce a new technique, called Bag-of-Queries (BoQ), which learns a set of global queries designed to capture universal place-specific attributes. Unlike existing methods that employ self-attention and generate the queries directly from the input features, BoQ employs distinct learnable global queries, which probe the input features via cross-attention, ensuring consistent information aggregation. In addition, our technique provides an interpretable attention mechanism and integrates with both CNN and Vision Transformer backbones. The performance of BoQ is demonstrated through extensive experiments on 14 large-scale benchmarks. It consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques including NetVLAD, MixVPR and EigenPlaces. Moreover, as a global retrieval technique (one-stage), BoQ surpasses two-stage retrieval methods, such as Patch-NetVLAD, TransVPR and R2Former, all while being orders of magnitude faster and more efficient.

While Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are the standard default solution for solving the aerial localization problem, it is subject to a number of limitations, such as, signal instability or solution unreliability that make this option not so desirable. Consequently, visual geolocalization is emerging as a viable alternative. However, adapting Visual Place Recognition (VPR) task to aerial imagery presents significant challenges, including weather variations and repetitive patterns. Current VPR reviews largely neglect the specific context of aerial data. This paper introduces a methodology tailored for evaluating VPR techniques specifically in the domain of aerial imagery, providing a comprehensive assessment of various methods and their performance. However, we not only compare various VPR methods, but also demonstrate the importance of selecting appropriate zoom and overlap levels when constructing map tiles to achieve maximum efficiency of VPR algorithms in the case of aerial imagery.

VPR faces challenges such as accurate image neighbor retrieval and appearance change in scenery. Event cameras, also known as dynamic vision sensors, are a new sensor modality for VPR and offer a promising solution to the challenges with their unique attributes: high temporal resolution (1MHz clock), ultra-low latency (in {\mu}s), and high dynamic range (>120dB). These attributes make event cameras less susceptible to motion blur and more robust in variable lighting conditions, making them suitable for addressing VPR challenges. However, the scarcity of event-based VPR datasets, partly due to the novelty and cost of event cameras, hampers their adoption. To fill this data gap, our paper introduces the NYC-Event-VPR dataset to the robotics and computer vision communities, featuring the Prophesee IMX636 HD event sensor (1280x720 resolution), combined with RGB camera and GPS module. It encompasses over 13 hours of geotagged event data, spanning 260 kilometers across New York City, covering diverse lighting and weather conditions, day/night scenarios, and multiple visits to various locations. Furthermore, our paper employs three frameworks to conduct generalization performance assessments, promoting innovation in event-based VPR and its integration into robotics applications.</p></details> |  |

Model-free approaches compute the image pair similarity based on a spatial comparison of corresponding local visual features, eliminating the need for computationally expensive estimation of a model describing transformation between images. The article focuses on model-free re-ranking based on standard local visual features and their applicability in long-term autonomy systems. It introduces three new model-free re-ranking methods that were designed primarily for deep-learned local visual features. These features evince high robustness to various appearance changes, which stands as a crucial property for use with long-term autonomy systems. All the introduced methods were employed in a new visual place recognition system together with the D2-net feature detector (Dusmanu, 2019) and experimentally tested with diverse, challenging public datasets. The obtained results are on par with current state-of-the-art methods, affirming that model-free approaches are a viable and worthwhile path for long-term visual place recognition.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 9 figures, IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles (Early Access)</p></details> |
| **[Context-Based Visual-Language Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19341v1)** | 2024-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In vision-based robot localization and SLAM, Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is essential. This paper addresses the problem of VPR, which involves accurately recognizing the location corresponding to a given query image. A popular approach to vision-based place recognition relies on low-level visual features. Despite significant progress in recent years, place recognition based on low-level visual features is challenging when there are changes in scene appearance. To address this, end-to-end training approaches have been proposed to overcome the limitations of hand-crafted features. However, these approaches still fail under drastic changes and require large amounts of labeled data to train models, presenting a significant limitation. Methods that leverage high-level semantic information, such as objects or categories, have been proposed to handle variations in appearance. In this paper, we introduce a novel VPR approach that remains robust to scene changes and does not require additional training. Our method constructs semantic image descriptors by extracting pixel-level embeddings using a zero-shot, language-driven semantic segmentation model. We validate our approach in challenging place recognition scenarios using real-world public dataset.

| **[Monocular Visual Place Recognition in LiDAR Maps via Cross-Modal State Space Model and Multi-View Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06285v1)** | 2024-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving monocular camera localization within pre-built LiDAR maps can bypass the simultaneous mapping process of visual SLAM systems, potentially reducing the computational overhead of autonomous localization. To this end, one of the key challenges is cross-modal place recognition, which involves retrieving 3D scenes (point clouds) from a LiDAR map according to online RGB images. In this paper, we introduce an efficient framework to learn descriptors for both RGB images and point clouds. It takes visual state space model (VMamba) as the backbone and employs a pixel-view-scene joint training strategy for cross-modal contrastive learning. To address the field-of-view differences, independent descriptors are generated from multiple evenly distributed viewpoints for point clouds. A visible 3D points overlap strategy is then designed to quantify the similarity between point cloud views and RGB images for multi-view supervision. Additionally, when generating descriptors from pixel-level features using NetVLAD, we compensate for the loss of geometric information, and introduce an efficient scheme for multi-view generation. Experimental results on the KITTI and KITTI-360 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our method. The code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[VLAD-BuFF: Burst-aware Fast Feature Aggregation for Visual Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19293v1)** | 2024-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is a crucial component of many visual localization pipelines for embodied agents. VPR is often formulated as an image retrieval task aimed at jointly learning local features and an aggregation method. The current state-of-the-art VPR methods rely on VLAD aggregation, which can be trained to learn a weighted contribution of features through their soft assignment to cluster centers. However, this process has two key limitations. Firstly, the feature-to-cluster weighting does not account for over-represented repetitive structures within a cluster, e.g., shadows or window panes; this phenomenon is also referred to as the `burstiness' problem, classically solved by discounting repetitive features before aggregation. Secondly, feature to cluster comparisons are compute-intensive for state-of-the-art image encoders with high-dimensional local features. This paper addresses these limitations by introducing VLAD-BuFF with two novel contributions: i) a self-similarity based feature discounting mechanism to learn Burst-aware features within end-to-end VPR training, and ii) Fast Feature aggregation by reducing local feature dimensions specifically through PCA-initialized learnable pre-projection. We benchmark our method on 9 public datasets, where VLAD-BuFF sets a new state of the art. Our method is able to maintain its high recall even for 12x reduced local feature dimensions, thus enabling fast feature aggregation without compromising on recall. Through additional qualitative studies, we show how our proposed weighting method effectively downweights the non-distinctive features.

| **[Revisit Anything: Visual Place Recognition via Image Segment Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18049v1)** | 2024-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately recognizing a revisited place is crucial for embodied agents to localize and navigate. This requires visual representations to be distinct, despite strong variations in camera viewpoint and scene appearance. Existing visual place recognition pipelines encode the "whole" image and search for matches. This poses a fundamental challenge in matching two images of the same place captured from different camera viewpoints: "the similarity of what overlaps can be dominated by the dissimilarity of what does not overlap". We address this by encoding and searching for "image segments" instead of the whole images. We propose to use open-set image segmentation to decompose an image into `meaningful' entities (i.e., things and stuff). This enables us to create a novel image representation as a collection of multiple overlapping subgraphs connecting a segment with its neighboring segments, dubbed SuperSegment. Furthermore, to efficiently encode these SuperSegments into compact vector representations, we propose a novel factorized representation of feature aggregation. We show that retrieving these partial representations leads to significantly higher recognition recall than the typical whole image based retrieval. Our segments-based approach, dubbed SegVLAD, sets a new state-of-the-art in place recognition on a diverse selection of benchmark datasets, while being applicable to both generic and task-specialized image encoders. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of our method to ``revisit anything'' by evaluating our method on an object instance retrieval task, which bridges the two disparate areas of research: visual place recognition and object-goal navigation, through their common aim of recognizing goal objects specific to a place.

| **[NeRF-Supervised Feature Point Detection and Description](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08156v3)** | 2024-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Feature point detection and description is the backbone for various computer vision applications, such as Structure-from-Motion, visual SLAM, and visual place recognition. While learning-based methods have surpassed traditional handcrafted techniques, their training often relies on simplistic homography-based simulations of multi-view perspectives, limiting model generalisability. This paper presents a novel approach leveraging Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) to generate a diverse and realistic dataset consisting of indoor and outdoor scenes. Our proposed methodology adapts state-of-the-art feature detectors and descriptors for training on multi-view NeRF-synthesised data, with supervision achieved through perspective projective geometry. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed methodology achieves competitive or superior performance on standard benchmarks for relative pose estimation, point cloud registration, and homography estimation while requiring significantly less training data and time compared to existing approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Structured Pruning for Efficient Visual Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07834v1)** | 2024-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is fundamental for the global re-localization of robots and devices, enabling them to recognize previously visited locations based on visual inputs. This capability is crucial for maintaining accurate mapping and localization over large areas. Given that VPR methods need to operate in real-time on embedded systems, it is critical to optimize these systems for minimal resource consumption. While the most efficient VPR approaches employ standard convolutional backbones with fixed descriptor dimensions, these often lead to redundancy in the embedding space as well as in the network architecture. Our work introduces a novel structured pruning method, to not only streamline common VPR architectures but also to strategically remove redundancies within the feature embedding space. This dual focus significantly enhances the efficiency of the system, reducing both map and model memory requirements and decreasing feature extraction and retrieval latencies. Our approach has reduced memory usage and latency by 21% and 16%, respectively, across models, while minimally impacting recall@1 accuracy by less than 1%. This significant improvement enhances real-time applications on edge devices with negligible accuracy loss.</p></details> |  |
| **[Matched Filtering based LiDAR Place Recognition for Urban and Natural Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03998v1)** | 2024-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Place recognition is an important task within autonomous navigation, involving the re-identification of previously visited locations from an initial traverse. Unlike visual place recognition (VPR), LiDAR place recognition (LPR) is tolerant to changes in lighting, seasons, and textures, leading to high performance on benchmark datasets from structured urban environments. However, there is a growing need for methods that can operate in diverse environments with high performance and minimal training. In this paper, we propose a handcrafted matching strategy that performs roto-translation invariant place recognition and relative pose estimation for both urban and unstructured natural environments. Our approach constructs Birds Eye View (BEV) global descriptors and employs a two-stage search using matched filtering -- a signal processing technique for detecting known signals amidst noise. Extensive testing on the NCLT, Oxford Radar, and WildPlaces datasets consistently demonstrates state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance across place recognition and relative pose estimation metrics, with up to 15% higher recall than previous SoTA.</p></details> |  |

Visual place recognition, a critical component for navigation, is often hampered by the high resource demands of conventional systems, making them unsuitable for small-scale robotic platforms which still require to perform complex, long-range tasks. Although neuromorphic approaches offer potential for greater efficiency, real-time edge deployment remains constrained by the complexity and limited scalability of bio-realistic networks. Here, we demonstrate a neuromorphic localization system that performs accurate place recognition in up to 8km of traversal using models as small as 180 KB with 44k parameters, while consuming less than 1% of the energy required by conventional methods. Our Locational Encoding with Neuromorphic Systems (LENS) integrates spiking neural networks, an event-based dynamic vision sensor, and a neuromorphic processor within a single SPECK(TM) chip, enabling real-time, energy-efficient localization on a hexapod robot. LENS represents the first fully neuromorphic localization system capable of large-scale, on-device deployment, setting a new benchmark for energy efficient robotic place recognition.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 4 main figures, 4 supplementary figures, 1 supplementary table, and 1 movie.

| **[Enhancing Visual Place Recognition via Fast and Slow Adaptive Biasing in Event Cameras](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16425v2)** | 2024-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event cameras are increasingly popular in robotics due to beneficial features such as low latency, energy efficiency, and high dynamic range. Nevertheless, their downstream task performance is greatly influenced by the optimization of bias parameters. These parameters, for instance, regulate the necessary change in light intensity to trigger an event, which in turn depends on factors such as the environment lighting and camera motion. This paper introduces feedback control algorithms that automatically tune the bias parameters through two interacting methods: 1) An immediate, on-the-fly \textit{fast} adaptation of the refractory period, which sets the minimum interval between consecutive events, and 2) if the event rate exceeds the specified bounds even after changing the refractory period repeatedly, the controller adapts the pixel bandwidth and event thresholds, which stabilizes after a short period of noise events across all pixels (\textit{slow} adaptation). Our evaluation focuses on the visual place recognition task, where incoming query images are compared to a given reference database. We conducted comprehensive evaluations of our algorithms' adaptive feedback control in real-time. To do so, we collected the QCR-Fast-and-Slow dataset that contains DAVIS346 event camera streams from 366 repeated traversals of a Scout Mini robot navigating through a 100 meter long indoor lab setting (totaling over 35km distance traveled) in varying brightness conditions with ground truth location information. Our proposed feedback controllers result in superior performance when compared to the standard bias settings and prior feedback control methods. Our findings also detail the impact of bias adjustments on task performance and feature ablation studies on the fast and slow adaptation mechanisms.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 9 figures, paper accepted to the 2024 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2024)</p></details> |

While existing work demonstrates the viability of meshes for visual localization, the impact of using synthetic databases rendered from them in visual place recognition remains largely unexplored. In this work we investigate using dense 3D textured meshes for large-scale Visual Place Recognition (VPR). We identify a significant performance drop when using synthetic mesh-based image databases compared to real-world images for retrieval. To address this, we propose MeshVPR, a novel VPR pipeline that utilizes a lightweight features alignment framework to bridge the gap between real-world and synthetic domains. MeshVPR leverages pre-trained VPR models and is efficient and scalable for city-wide deployments. We introduce novel datasets with freely available 3D meshes and manually collected queries from Berlin, Paris, and Melbourne. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that MeshVPR achieves competitive performance with standard VPR pipelines, paving the way for mesh-based localization systems.

| **[BEV$^2$PR: BEV-Enhanced Visual Place Recognition with Structural Cues](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06600v2)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a new image-based visual place recognition (VPR) framework by exploiting the structural cues in bird's-eye view (BEV) from a single monocular camera. The motivation arises from two key observations about place recognition methods based on both appearance and structure: 1) For the methods relying on LiDAR sensors, the integration of LiDAR in robotic systems has led to increased expenses, while the alignment of data between different sensors is also a major challenge. 2) Other image-/camera-based methods, involving integrating RGB images and their derived variants (eg, pseudo depth images, pseudo 3D point clouds), exhibit several limitations, such as the failure to effectively exploit the explicit spatial relationships between different objects. To tackle the above issues, we design a new BEV-enhanced VPR framework, namely BEV$^2$PR, generating a composite descriptor with both visual cues and spatial awareness based on a single camera. The key points lie in: 1) We use BEV features as an explicit source of structural knowledge in constructing global features. 2) The lower layers of the pre-trained backbone from BEV generation are shared for visual and structural streams in VPR, facilitating the learning of fine-grained local features in the visual stream. 3) The complementary visual and structural features can jointly enhance VPR performance. Our BEV$^2$PR framework enables consistent performance improvements over several popular aggregation modules for RGB global features. The experiments on our collected VPR-NuScenes dataset demonstrate an absolute gain of 2.47% on Recall@1 for the strong Conv-AP baseline to achieve the best performance in our setting, and notably, a 18.06% gain on the hard set.

Current methods often rely on a classification-based pre-training, which we hypothesise to be holding back from extending capabilities of implicit image understanding. We propose pre-training the visual encoder of a driving agent using the self-distillation with no labels (DINO) method, which relies on a self-supervised learning paradigm.% and is trained on an unrelated task. Our experiments in CARLA environment in accordance with the Leaderboard benchmark reveal that the proposed pre-training is more efficient than classification-based pre-training, and is on par with the recently proposed pre-training based on visual place recognition (VPRPre).</p></details> |  |
| **[LVLM-empowered Multi-modal Representation Learning for Visual Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06730v1)** | 2024-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual place recognition (VPR) remains challenging due to significant viewpoint changes and appearance variations. Mainstream works tackle these challenges by developing various feature aggregation methods to transform deep features into robust and compact global representations. Unfortunately, satisfactory results cannot be achieved under challenging conditions. We start from a new perspective and attempt to build a discriminative global representations by fusing image data and text descriptions of the the visual scene. The motivation is twofold: (1) Current Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate extraordinary emergent capability in visual instruction following, and thus provide an efficient and flexible manner in generating text descriptions of images; (2) The text descriptions, which provide high-level scene understanding, show strong robustness against environment variations. Although promising, leveraging LVLMs to build multi-modal VPR solutions remains challenging in efficient multi-modal fusion. Furthermore, LVLMs will inevitably produces some inaccurate descriptions, making it even harder. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel multi-modal VPR solution. It first adapts pre-trained visual and language foundation models to VPR for extracting image and text features, which are then fed into the feature combiner to enhance each other. As the main component, the feature combiner first propose a token-wise attention block to adaptively recalibrate text tokens according to their relevance to the image data, and then develop an efficient cross-attention fusion module to propagate information across different modalities. The enhanced multi-modal features are compressed into the feature descriptor for performing retrieval. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin with significantly smaller image descriptor dimension.</p></details> |  |
| **[Close, But Not There: Boosting Geographic Distance Sensitivity in Visual Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02422v1)** | 2024-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Place Recognition (VPR) plays a critical role in many localization and mapping pipelines. It consists of retrieving the closest sample to a query image, in a certain embedding space, from a database of geotagged references. The image embedding is learned to effectively describe a place despite variations in visual appearance, viewpoint, and geometric changes. In this work, we formulate how limitations in the Geographic Distance Sensitivity of current VPR embeddings result in a high probability of incorrectly sorting the top-k retrievals, negatively impacting the recall. In order to address this issue in single-stage VPR, we propose a novel mining strategy, CliqueMining, that selects positive and negative examples by sampling cliques from a graph of visually similar images. Our approach boosts the sensitivity of VPR embeddings at small distance ranges, significantly improving the state of the art on relevant benchmarks. In particular, we raise recall@1 from 75% to 82% in MSLS Challenge, and from 76% to 90% in Nordland. Models and code are available at https://github.com/serizba/cliquemining.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamically Modulating Visual Place Recognition Sequence Length For Minimum Acceptable Performance Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00863v1)** | 2024-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mobile robots and autonomous vehicles are often required to function in environments where critical position estimates from sensors such as GPS become uncertain or unreliable. Single image visual place recognition (VPR) provides an alternative for localization but often requires techniques such as sequence matching to improve robustness, which incurs additional computation and latency costs. Even then, the sequence length required to localize at an acceptable performance level varies widely; and simply setting overly long fixed sequence lengths creates unnecessary latency, computational overhead, and can even degrade performance. In these scenarios it is often more desirable to meet or exceed a set target performance at minimal expense. In this paper we present an approach which uses a calibration set of data to fit a model that modulates sequence length for VPR as needed to exceed a target localization performance. We make use of a coarse position prior, which could be provided by any other localization system, and capture the variation in appearance across this region. We use the correlation between appearance variation and sequence length to curate VPR features and fit a multilayer perceptron (MLP) for selecting the optimal length. We demonstrate that this method is effective at modulating sequence length to maximize the number of sections in a dataset which meet or exceed a target performance whilst minimizing the median length used. We show applicability across several datasets and reveal key phenomena like generalization capabilities, the benefits of curating features and the utility of non-state-of-the-art feature extractors with nuanced properties.</p></details> | DOI TBC |
| **[Optimal Transport Aggregation for Visual Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15937v2)** | 2024-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The task of Visual Place Recognition (VPR) aims to match a query image against references from an extensive database of images from different places, relying solely on visual cues. State-of-the-art pipelines focus on the aggregation of features extracted from a deep backbone, in order to form a global descriptor for each image. In this context, we introduce SALAD (Sinkhorn Algorithm for Locally Aggregated Descriptors), which reformulates NetVLAD's soft-assignment of local features to clusters as an optimal transport problem. In SALAD, we consider both feature-to-cluster and cluster-to-feature relations and we also introduce a 'dustbin' cluster, designed to selectively discard features deemed non-informative, enhancing the overall descriptor quality. Additionally, we leverage and fine-tune DINOv2 as a backbone, which provides enhanced description power for the local features, and dramatically reduces the required training time. As a result, our single-stage method not only surpasses single-stage baselines in public VPR datasets, but also surpasses two-stage methods that add a re-ranking with significantly higher cost. Code and models are available at https://github.com/serizba/salad.</p></details> |  |

However, their performance in place recognition is still underexplored. In this work, we introduce multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) to visual place recognition (VPR), where a robot must localize itself using visual observations. Our key design is to use vision-based retrieval to propose several candidates and then leverage language-based reasoning to carefully inspect each candidate for a final decision. Specifically, we leverage the robust visual features produced by off-the-shelf vision foundation models (VFMs) to obtain several candidate locations. We then prompt an MLLM to describe the differences between the current observation and each candidate in a pairwise manner, and reason about the best candidate based on these descriptions. Our results on three datasets demonstrate that integrating the general-purpose visual features from VFMs with the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs already provides an effective place recognition solution, without any VPR-specific supervised training. We believe our work can inspire new possibilities for applying and designing foundation models, i.e., VFMs, LLMs, and MLLMs, to enhance the localization and navigation of mobile robots.</p></details> |  |

Contemporary methods in visual place recognition employ convolutional neural networks and utilize every region within the image for the place recognition task. However, the presence of dynamic and distracting elements in the image may impact the effectiveness of the place recognition process. Therefore, it is meaningful to focus on task-relevant regions of the image for improved recognition. In this paper, we present PlaceFormer, a novel transformer-based approach for visual place recognition. PlaceFormer employs patch tokens from the transformer to create global image descriptors, which are then used for image retrieval. To re-rank the retrieved images, PlaceFormer merges the patch tokens from the transformer to form multi-scale patches. Utilizing the transformer's self-attention mechanism, it selects patches that correspond to task-relevant areas in an image. These selected patches undergo geometric verification, generating similarity scores across different patch sizes. Subsequently, spatial scores from each patch size are fused to produce a final similarity score. This score is then used to re-rank the images initially retrieved using global image descriptors. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that PlaceFormer outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency, requiring less time and memory.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Robotics and Automation Letters</p></details> |

Due to the significant changes in appearance caused by season, lighting, and time spans between query images and database images for retrieval, these differences increase the difficulty of place recognition. Previous methods often discarded useless features (such as sky, road, vehicles) while uncontrolled discarding features that help improve recognition accuracy (such as buildings, trees). To preserve these useful features, we propose a new feature aggregation method to address this issue. Specifically, in order to obtain global and local features that contain discriminative place information, we added some registers on top of the original image tokens to assist in model training. After reallocating attention weights, these registers were discarded. The experimental results show that these registers surprisingly separate unstable features from the original image representation and outperform state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

VPR uses a database of geo-tagged images and leverages deep neural networks to extract a global representation, called descriptor, from each image. While the training data for VPR models often originates from diverse, geographically scattered sources (geo-tagged images), the training process itself is typically assumed to be centralized. This research revisits the task of VPR through the lens of Federated Learning (FL), addressing several key challenges associated with this adaptation. VPR data inherently lacks well-defined classes, and models are typically trained using contrastive learning, which necessitates a data mining step on a centralized database. Additionally, client devices in federated systems can be highly heterogeneous in terms of their processing capabilities. The proposed FedVPR framework not only presents a novel approach for VPR but also introduces a new, challenging, and realistic task for FL research, paving the way to other image retrieval tasks in FL.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 7 figures, CVPR - The 3rd International Workshop on Federated Learning for Computer Vision (FedVision-2024)</p></details> |

However, the analogous robotics capability, visual place recognition (VPR) with limited field of view cameras under 180 degree rotations, has proven to be challenging to achieve. To address this problem, this paper presents Same Place Opposing Trajectory (SPOT), a technique for opposing viewpoint VPR that relies exclusively on structure estimated through stereo visual odometry (VO). The method extends recent advances in lidar descriptors and utilizes a novel double (similar and opposing) distance matrix sequence matching method. We evaluate SPOT on a publicly available dataset with 6.7-7.6 km routes driven in similar and opposing directions under various lighting conditions. The proposed algorithm demonstrates remarkable improvement over the state-of-the-art, achieving up to 91.7% recall at 100% precision in opposing viewpoint cases, while requiring less storage than all baselines tested and running faster than all but one. Moreover, the proposed method assumes no a priori knowledge of whether the viewpoint is similar or opposing, and also demonstrates competitive performance in similar viewpoint cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICRA 2024, project website: https://umautobots.github.io/spot</p></details> |

Thanks to the practical feature extraction ability of the lightweight convolution neural networks (CNNs) and the train-ability of the vector of locally aggregated descriptors (VLAD) layer, we propose a lightweight weakly supervised end-to-end neural network consisting of a front-ended perception model called GhostCNN and a learnable VLAD layer as a back-end. GhostCNN is based on Ghost modules that are lightweight CNN-based architectures. They can generate redundant feature maps using linear operations instead of the traditional convolution process, making a good trade-off between computation resources and recognition accuracy. To enhance our proposed lightweight model further, we add dilated convolutions to the Ghost module to get features containing more spatial semantic information, improving accuracy. Finally, rich experiments conducted on a commonly used public benchmark and our private dataset validate that the proposed neural network reduces the FLOPs and parameters of VGG16-NetVLAD by 99.04% and 80.16%, respectively. Besides, both models achieve similar accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Seamless Adaptation of Pre-trained Models for Visual Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14505v3)** | 2024-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies show that vision models pre-trained in generic visual learning tasks with large-scale data can provide useful feature representations for a wide range of visual perception problems. However, few attempts have been made to exploit pre-trained foundation models in visual place recognition (VPR). Due to the inherent difference in training objectives and data between the tasks of model pre-training and VPR, how to bridge the gap and fully unleash the capability of pre-trained models for VPR is still a key issue to address. To this end, we propose a novel method to realize seamless adaptation of pre-trained models for VPR. Specifically, to obtain both global and local features that focus on salient landmarks for discriminating places, we design a hybrid adaptation method to achieve both global and local adaptation efficiently, in which only lightweight adapters are tuned without adjusting the pre-trained model. Besides, to guide effective adaptation, we propose a mutual nearest neighbor local feature loss, which ensures proper dense local features are produced for local matching and avoids time-consuming spatial verification in re-ranking. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with less training data and training time, and uses about only 3% retrieval runtime of the two-stage VPR methods with RANSAC-based spatial verification. It ranks 1st on the MSLS challenge leaderboard (at the time of submission). The code is released at https://github.com/Lu-Feng/SelaVPR.</p></details> | ICLR2024 |
| **[CricaVPR: Cross-image Correlation-aware Representation Learning for Visual Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19231v2)** | 2024-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the past decade, most methods in visual place recognition (VPR) have used neural networks to produce feature representations. These networks typically produce a global representation of a place image using only this image itself and neglect the cross-image variations (e.g. viewpoint and illumination), which limits their robustness in challenging scenes. In this paper, we propose a robust global representation method with cross-image correlation awareness for VPR, named CricaVPR. Our method uses the attention mechanism to correlate multiple images within a batch. These images can be taken in the same place with different conditions or viewpoints, or even captured from different places. Therefore, our method can utilize the cross-image variations as a cue to guide the representation learning, which ensures more robust features are produced. To further facilitate the robustness, we propose a multi-scale convolution-enhanced adaptation method to adapt pre-trained visual foundation models to the VPR task, which introduces the multi-scale local information to further enhance the cross-image correlation-aware representation. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin with significantly less training time.

| **[On the Estimation of Image-matching Uncertainty in Visual Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00546v1)** | 2024-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Visual Place Recognition (VPR) the pose of a query image is estimated by comparing the image to a map of reference images with known reference poses. As is typical for image retrieval problems, a feature extractor maps the query and reference images to a feature space, where a nearest neighbor search is then performed. However, till recently little attention has been given to quantifying the confidence that a retrieved reference image is a correct match. Highly certain but incorrect retrieval can lead to catastrophic failure of VPR-based localization pipelines. This work compares for the first time the main approaches for estimating the image-matching uncertainty, including the traditional retrieval-based uncertainty estimation, more recent data-driven aleatoric uncertainty estimation, and the compute-intensive geometric verification. We further formulate a simple baseline method, ``SUE'', which unlike the other methods considers the freely-available poses of the reference images in the map. Our experiments reveal that a simple L2-distance between the query and reference descriptors is already a better estimate of image-matching uncertainty than current data-driven approaches. SUE outperforms the other efficient uncertainty estimation methods, and its uncertainty estimates complement the computationally expensive geometric verification approach. Future works for uncertainty estimation in VPR should consider the baselines discussed in this work.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in the proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) 2024</p></details> |

It is challenging due to appearance changes at various frequencies, and difficulties of obtaining ground truth metric trajectories for training and evaluation. This paper introduces the NYC-Indoor-VPR dataset, a unique and rich collection of over 36,000 images compiled from 13 distinct crowded scenes in New York City taken under varying lighting conditions with appearance changes. Each scene has multiple revisits across a year. To establish the ground truth for VPR, we propose a semiautomatic annotation approach that computes the positional information of each image. Our method specifically takes pairs of videos as input and yields matched pairs of images along with their estimated relative locations. The accuracy of this matching is refined by human annotators, who utilize our annotation software to correlate the selected keyframes. Finally, we present a benchmark evaluation of several state-of-the-art VPR algorithms using our annotated dataset, revealing its challenge and thus value for VPR research.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 7 figures, published in 2024 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA 2024)</p></details> |

Since typically a mobile robot has access to a continuous stream of frames, this task is naturally cast as a sequence-to-sequence localization problem. Nevertheless, obtaining sequences of labelled data is much more expensive than collecting isolated images, which can be done in an automated way with little supervision. As a mitigation to this problem, we propose a novel Joint Image and Sequence Training protocol (JIST) that leverages large uncurated sets of images through a multi-task learning framework. With JIST we also introduce SeqGeM, an aggregation layer that revisits the popular GeM pooling to produce a single robust and compact embedding from a sequence of single-frame embeddings. We show that our model is able to outperform previous state of the art while being faster, using 8 times smaller descriptors, having a lighter architecture and allowing to process sequences of various lengths.

However, like many vision tasks, VPR always degrades at night due to the scarcity of nighttime images. Moreover, VPR needs to address the cross-domain problem of night-to-day rather than just the issue of a single nighttime domain. In response to these issues, we present NocPlace, which leverages generative and inherited knowledge transfer to embed resilience against dazzling lights and extreme darkness in the global descriptor. First, we establish a day-night urban scene dataset called NightCities, capturing diverse lighting variations and dark scenarios across 60 cities globally. Then, an image generation network is trained on this dataset and processes a large-scale VPR dataset, obtaining its nighttime version. Finally, VPR models are fine-tuned using descriptors inherited from themselves and night-style images, which builds explicit cross-domain contrastive relationships. Comprehensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate our contributions and the superiority of NocPlace. Without adding any real-time computing resources, NocPlace improves the performance of Eigenplaces by 7.6% on Tokyo 24/7 Night and 16.8% on SVOX Night.</p></details> | 28 pages,9 figures |
| **[Deep Homography Estimation for Visual Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16086v2)** | 2024-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual place recognition (VPR) is a fundamental task for many applications such as robot localization and augmented reality. Recently, the hierarchical VPR methods have received considerable attention due to the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. They usually first use global features to retrieve the candidate images, then verify the spatial consistency of matched local features for re-ranking. However, the latter typically relies on the RANSAC algorithm for fitting homography, which is time-consuming and non-differentiable. This makes existing methods compromise to train the network only in global feature extraction. Here, we propose a transformer-based deep homography estimation (DHE) network that takes the dense feature map extracted by a backbone network as input and fits homography for fast and learnable geometric verification. Moreover, we design a re-projection error of inliers loss to train the DHE network without additional homography labels, which can also be jointly trained with the backbone network to help it extract the features that are more suitable for local matching. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method can outperform several state-of-the-art methods. And it is more than one order of magnitude faster than the mainstream hierarchical VPR methods using RANSAC.

Further, a well-balanced combination of data-based and training-free approaches can decrease the required amount of training data and effort and can reduce the influence of distribution shifts between the training and application phases. This paper proposes a runtime and data-efficient hierarchical VPR pipeline that extends existing approaches and presents novel ideas. There are three main contributions: First, we propose Local Positional Graphs (LPG), a training-free and runtime-efficient approach to encode spatial context information of local image features. LPG can be combined with existing local feature detectors and descriptors and considerably improves the image-matching quality compared to existing techniques in our experiments. Second, we present Attentive Local SPED (ATLAS), an extension of our previous local features approach with an attention module that improves the feature quality while maintaining high data efficiency. The influence of the proposed modifications is evaluated in an extensive ablation study. Third, we present a hierarchical pipeline that exploits hyperdimensional computing to use the same local features as holistic HDC-descriptors for fast candidate selection and for candidate reranking. We combine all contributions in a runtime and data-efficient VPR pipeline that shows benefits over the state-of-the-art method Patch-NetVLAD on a large collection of standard place recognition datasets with 15$\%$ better performance in VPR accuracy, 54$\times$ faster feature comparison speed, and 55$\times$ less descriptor storage occupancy, making our method promising for real-world high-performance large-scale VPR in changing environments.

Two parallel lines of work on VPR have shown, on one side, that general-purpose off-the-shelf feature representations can provide robustness to domain shifts, and, on the other, that fused information from sequences of images improves performance. In our recent work on measuring domain gaps between image datasets, we proposed a Visual Distribution of Neuron Activations (VDNA) representation to represent datasets of images. This representation can naturally handle image sequences and provides a general and granular feature representation derived from a general-purpose model. Moreover, our representation is based on tracking neuron activation values over the list of images to represent and is not limited to a particular neural network layer, therefore having access to high- and low-level concepts. This work shows how VDNAs can be used for VPR by learning a very lightweight and simple encoder to generate task-specific descriptors. Our experiments show that our representation can allow for better robustness than current solutions to serious domain shifts away from the training data distribution, such as to indoor environments and aerial imagery.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICRA 2024</p></details> |

Ideas like multi-process fusion, Fly-Inspired Voting Units, SwitchHit or Switch-Fuse involve combining different VPR techniques together, utilizing different strategies. However, a major aspect often common to many of these strategies is voting. Voting is an extremely relevant topic to explore in terms of its application and significance for any ensemble VPR setup. This paper analyses several voting schemes to maximise the place detection accuracy of a VPR ensemble set up and determine the optimal voting schemes for selection. We take inspiration from a variety of voting schemes that are widely employed in fields such as politics and sociology and it is evident via empirical data that the selection of the voting method influences the results drastically. The paper tests a wide variety of voting schemes to present the improvement in the VPR results for several data sets. We aim to determine whether a single optimal voting scheme exists or, much like in other fields of research, the selection of a voting technique is relative to its application and environment. We propose a ranking of these different voting methods from best to worst which allows for better selection. While presenting our results in terms of voting method's performance bounds, in form of radar charts, PR curves to showcase the difference in performance and a comparison methodology using a McNemar test variant to determine the statistical significance of the differences. This test is performed to further confirm the reliability of outcomes and draw comparisons for better and informed selection a voting technique.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2305.05705</p></details> |

While these capabilities are well suited for robotics tasks, SNNs have seen limited adaptation in this field thus far. This work introduces a SNN for Visual Place Recognition (VPR) that is both trainable within minutes and queryable in milliseconds, making it well suited for deployment on compute-constrained robotic systems. Our proposed system, VPRTempo, overcomes slow training and inference times using an abstracted SNN that trades biological realism for efficiency. VPRTempo employs a temporal code that determines the timing of a single spike based on a pixel's intensity, as opposed to prior SNNs relying on rate coding that determined the number of spikes; improving spike efficiency by over 100%. VPRTempo is trained using Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity and a supervised delta learning rule enforcing that each output spiking neuron responds to just a single place. We evaluate our system on the Nordland and Oxford RobotCar benchmark localization datasets, which include up to 27k places. We found that VPRTempo's accuracy is comparable to prior SNNs and the popular NetVLAD place recognition algorithm, while being several orders of magnitude faster and suitable for real-time deployment -- with inference speeds over 50 Hz on CPU. VPRTempo could be integrated as a loop closure component for online SLAM on resource-constrained systems such as space and underwater robots.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, accepted to the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) 2024</p></details> |
| **[PlaceNav: Topological Navigation through Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17260v4)** | 2024-02-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent results suggest that splitting topological navigation into robot-independent and robot-specific components improves navigation performance by enabling the robot-independent part to be trained with data collected by robots of different types. However, the navigation methods' performance is still limited by the scarcity of suitable training data and they suffer from poor computational scaling. In this work, we present PlaceNav, subdividing the robot-independent part into navigation-specific and generic computer vision components. We utilize visual place recognition for the subgoal selection of the topological navigation pipeline. This makes subgoal selection more efficient and enables leveraging large-scale datasets from non-robotics sources, increasing training data availability. Bayesian filtering, enabled by place recognition, further improves navigation performance by increasing the temporal consistency of subgoals. Our experimental results verify the design and the new method obtains a 76% higher success rate in indoor and 23% higher in outdoor navigation tasks with higher computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICRA2...</summary><p>ICRA2024 camera ready</p></details> |

However, the city-scale Lidar maps generally need to be compressed for storage efficiency, which increases the difficulty of direct visual place recognition in compressed Lidar maps. This paper proposes VOLoc, an accurate and efficient visual place recognition method that exploits geometric similarity to directly query the compressed Lidar map via the real-time captured image sequence. In the offline phase, VOLoc compresses the Lidar maps using a \emph{Geometry-Preserving Compressor} (GPC), in which the compression is reversible, a crucial requirement for the downstream 6DoF pose estimation. In the online phase, VOLoc proposes an online Geometric Recovery Module (GRM), which is composed of online Visual Odometry (VO) and a point cloud optimization module, such that the local scene structure around the camera is online recovered to build the \emph{Querying Point Cloud} (QPC). Then the QPC is compressed by the same GPC, and is aggregated into a global descriptor by an attention-based aggregation module, to query the compressed Lidar map in the vector space. A transfer learning mechanism is also proposed to improve the accuracy and the generality of the aggregation network. Extensive evaluations show that VOLoc provides localization accuracy even better than the Lidar-to-Lidar place recognition, setting up a new record for utilizing the compressed Lidar map by low-end mobile cameras.

| **[Spike-EVPR: Deep Spiking Residual Network with Cross-Representation Aggregation for Event-Based Visual Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10476v1)** | 2024-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event cameras have been successfully applied to visual place recognition (VPR) tasks by using deep artificial neural networks (ANNs) in recent years. However, previously proposed deep ANN architectures are often unable to harness the abundant temporal information presented in event streams. In contrast, deep spiking networks exhibit more intricate spatiotemporal dynamics and are inherently well-suited to process sparse asynchronous event streams. Unfortunately, directly inputting temporal-dense event volumes into the spiking network introduces excessive time steps, resulting in prohibitively high training costs for large-scale VPR tasks. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a novel deep spiking network architecture called Spike-EVPR for event-based VPR tasks. First, we introduce two novel event representations tailored for SNN to fully exploit the spatio-temporal information from the event streams, and reduce the video memory occupation during training as much as possible. Then, to exploit the full potential of these two representations, we construct a Bifurcated Spike Residual Encoder (BSR-Encoder) with powerful representational capabilities to better extract the high-level features from the two event representations. Next, we introduce a Shared & Specific Descriptor Extractor (SSD-Extractor). This module is designed to extract features shared between the two representations and features specific to each. Finally, we propose a Cross-Descriptor Aggregation Module (CDA-Module) that fuses the above three features to generate a refined, robust global descriptor of the scene. Our experimental results indicate the superior performance of our Spike-EVPR compared to several existing EVPR pipelines on Brisbane-Event-VPR and DDD20 datasets, with the average Recall@1 increased by 7.61% on Brisbane and 13.20% on DDD20.</p></details> | 14 pages, 10 figures |

Existing methods often rely on contrastive learning: image descriptors are trained to have small distance for similar images and larger distance for dissimilar ones in a latent space. However, this approach struggles to ensure accurate distance-based image similarity representation, particularly when training with binary pairwise labels, and complex re-ranking strategies are required. This work introduces a fresh perspective by framing place recognition as a regression problem, using camera field-of-view overlap as similarity ground truth for learning. By optimizing image descriptors to align directly with graded similarity labels, this approach enhances ranking capabilities without expensive re-ranking, offering data-efficient training and strong generalization across several benchmark datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in ICRA 2024</p></details> |

To improve the robustness of VPR in perceptually aliasing scenarios, sequence-based VPR methods are proposed. These methods are either based on matching between frame sequences or extracting sequence descriptors for direct retrieval. However, the former is usually based on the assumption of constant velocity, which is difficult to hold in practice, and is computationally expensive and subject to sequence length. Although the latter overcomes these problems, existing sequence descriptors are constructed by aggregating features of multiple frames only, without interaction on temporal information, and thus cannot obtain descriptors with spatio-temporal discrimination.In this paper, we propose a sequence descriptor that effectively incorporates spatio-temporal information. Specifically, spatial attention within the same frame is utilized to learn spatial feature patterns, while attention in corresponding local regions of different frames is utilized to learn the persistence or change of features over time. We use a sliding window to control the temporal range of attention and use relative positional encoding to construct sequential relationships between different features. This allows our descriptors to capture the intrinsic dynamics in a sequence of frames.Comprehensive experiments on challenging benchmark datasets show that the proposed approach outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods.The code is available at https://github.com/tiev-tongji/Spatio-Temporal-SeqVPR.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, published to RA-L</p></details> |

The proposed approach is formulated as a minimization problem in terms of dominating set algorithm for graph, constructed from spatial information, and referred as DominatingSet. Our algorithm shows better scene coverage in comparison to other methodologies that are used for database creation. Also, we demonstrate that using DominatingSet, a database size could be up to 250-1400 times smaller than the original scanning sequence while maintaining a recall rate of more than 80% on testing sequences. We evaluated our algorithm on 7-scenes and BundleFusion datasets and an additionally recorded sequence in a highly repetitive office setting. In addition, the database selection can produce weakly-supervised labels for fine-tuning neural place recognition algorithms to particular settings, improving even more their accuracy.

VPR is challenging due to the significant changes in a place's appearance driven by different daily illumination, seasonal weather variations and diverse viewpoints. Currently, no single VPR technique excels in every environmental condition, each exhibiting unique benefits and shortcomings, and therefore combining multiple techniques can achieve more reliable VPR performance. Present multi-method approaches either rely on online ground-truth information, which is often not available, or on brute-force technique combination, potentially lowering performance with high variance technique sets. Addressing these shortcomings, we propose a VPR system dubbed Multi-Sequential Information Consistency (MuSIC) which leverages sequential information to select the most cohesive technique on an online per-frame basis. For each technique in a set, MuSIC computes their respective sequential consistencies by analysing the frame-to-frame continuity of their top match candidates, which are then directly compared to select the optimal technique for the current query image. The use of sequential information to select between VPR methods results in an overall VPR performance increase across different benchmark datasets, while avoiding the need for extra ground-truth of the runtime environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2303.14247</p></details> |

While state-of-the-art approaches are trained in a supervised manner and therefore hardly capture the information needed for generalizing to unusual conditions, we argue that self-supervised learning may help abstracting the place representation so that it can be foreseen, irrespective of the conditions. More precisely, in this paper, we investigate learning features that are robust to appearance modifications while sensitive to geometric transformations in a self-supervised manner. This dual-purpose training is made possible by combining the two self-supervision main paradigms, \textit{i.e.} contrastive and predictive learning. Our results on standard benchmarks reveal that jointly learning such appearance-robust and geometry-sensitive image descriptors leads to competitive visual place recognition results across adverse seasonal and illumination conditions, without requiring any human-annotated labels.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 figures, WACV 2024</p></details> |

While VPR techniques built upon a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) backbone dominate state-of-the-art VPR performance, their high computational requirements make them unsuitable for platforms equipped with low-end hardware. Recently, a lightweight VPR system based on multiple bio-inspired classifiers, dubbed DrosoNets, has been proposed, achieving great computational efficiency at the cost of reduced absolute place retrieval performance. In this work, we propose a novel multi-DrosoNet localization system, dubbed RegionDrosoNet, with significantly improved VPR performance, while preserving a low-computational profile. Our approach relies on specializing distinct groups of DrosoNets on differently sliced partitions of the original image, increasing extrinsic model differentiation. Furthermore, we introduce a novel voting module to combine the outputs of all DrosoNets into the final place prediction which considers multiple top refence candidates from each DrosoNet. RegionDrosoNet outperforms other lightweight VPR techniques when dealing with both appearance changes and viewpoint variations. Moreover, it competes with computationally expensive methods on some benchmark datasets at a small fraction of their online inference time.</p></details> |  |

Nonetheless, integrating additional sensors comes with elevated costs and may not be feasible for systems that demand lightweight operation, thereby impacting the practical deployment of VPR. To address this issue, we resort to knowledge distillation, which empowers single-modal students to learn from cross-modal teachers without introducing additional sensors during inference. Despite the notable advancements achieved by current distillation approaches, the exploration of feature relationships remains an under-explored area. In order to tackle the challenge of cross-modal distillation in VPR, we present DistilVPR, a novel distillation pipeline for VPR.

It requires the ability to accurately recognize a previously visited location under variations such as illumination, occlusion, appearance and viewpoint. In the case of robotic systems and augmented reality, the target devices for deployment are battery powered edge devices. Therefore whilst the accuracy of VPR methods is important so too is memory consumption and latency. Recently new works have focused on the recall@1 metric as a performance measure with limited focus on resource utilization. This has resulted in methods that use deep learning models too large to deploy on low powered edge devices. We hypothesize that these large models are highly over-parameterized and can be optimized to satisfy the constraints of a low powered embedded system whilst maintaining high recall performance. Our work studies the impact of compact convolutional network architecture design in combination with full-precision and mixed-precision post-training quantization on VPR performance. Importantly we not only measure performance via the recall@1 score but also measure memory consumption and latency. We characterize the design implications on memory, latency and recall scores and provide a number of design recommendations for VPR systems under these resource limitations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Divide&Classify: Fine-Grained Classification for City-Wide Visual Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08417v2)** | 2023-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Place recognition is commonly addressed as an image retrieval problem. However, retrieval methods are impractical to scale to large datasets, densely sampled from city-wide maps, since their dimension impact negatively on the inference time. Using approximate nearest neighbour search for retrieval helps to mitigate this issue, at the cost of a performance drop. In this paper we investigate whether we can effectively approach this task as a classification problem, thus bypassing the need for a similarity search. We find that existing classification methods for coarse, planet-wide localization are not suitable for the fine-grained and city-wide setting. This is largely due to how the dataset is split into classes, because these methods are designed to handle a sparse distribution of photos and as such do not consider the visual aliasing problem across neighbouring classes that naturally arises in dense scenarios. Thus, we propose a partitioning scheme that enables a fast and accurate inference, preserving a simple learning procedure, and a novel inference pipeline based on an ensemble of novel classifiers that uses the prototypes learned via an angular margin loss. Our method, Divide&Classify (D&C), enjoys the fast inference of classification solutions and an accuracy competitive with retrieval methods on the fine-grained, city-wide setting. Moreover, we show that D&C can be paired with existing retrieval pipelines to speed up computations by over 20 times while increasing their recall, leading to new state-of-the-art results.</p></details> | Accepted to ICCV23 |

Although most current VPR methods achieve favorable results under ideal conditions, their performance in complex environments, characterized by lighting variations, seasonal changes, and occlusions caused by moving objects, is generally unsatisfactory. In this study, we utilize the DINOv2 model as the backbone network for trimming and fine-tuning to extract robust image features. We propose a novel VPR architecture called DINO-Mix, which combines a foundational vision model with feature aggregation. This architecture relies on the powerful image feature extraction capabilities of foundational vision models. We employ an MLP-Mixer-based mix module to aggregate image features, resulting in globally robust and generalizable descriptors that enable high-precision VPR. We experimentally demonstrate that the proposed DINO-Mix architecture significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

To date, the most performant VPR approaches are environment- and task-specific: while they exhibit strong performance in structured environments (predominantly urban driving), their performance degrades severely in unstructured environments, rendering most approaches brittle to robust real-world deployment. In this work, we develop a universal solution to VPR -- a technique that works across a broad range of structured and unstructured environments (urban, outdoors, indoors, aerial, underwater, and subterranean environments) without any re-training or fine-tuning. We demonstrate that general-purpose feature representations derived from off-the-shelf self-supervised models with no VPR-specific training are the right substrate upon which to build such a universal VPR solution. Combining these derived features with unsupervised feature aggregation enables our suite of methods, AnyLoc, to achieve up to 4X significantly higher performance than existing approaches. We further obtain a 6% improvement in performance by characterizing the semantic properties of these features, uncovering unique domains which encapsulate datasets from similar environments. Our detailed experiments and analysis lay a foundation for building VPR solutions that may be deployed anywhere, anytime, and across anyview.

| **[Scene Summarization: Clustering Scene Videos into Spatially Diverse Frames](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17940v1)** | 2023-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose scene summarization as a new video-based scene understanding task. It aims to summarize a long video walkthrough of a scene into a small set of frames that are spatially diverse in the scene, which has many impotant applications, such as in surveillance, real estate, and robotics. It stems from video summarization but focuses on long and continuous videos from moving cameras, instead of user-edited fragmented video clips that are more commonly studied in existing video summarization works. Our solution to this task is a two-stage self-supervised pipeline named SceneSum. Its first stage uses clustering to segment the video sequence. Our key idea is to combine visual place recognition (VPR) into this clustering process to promote spatial diversity. Its second stage needs to select a representative keyframe from each cluster as the summary while respecting resource constraints such as memory and disk space limits. Additionally, if the ground truth image trajectory is available, our method can be easily augmented with a supervised loss to enhance the clustering and keyframe selection. Extensive experiments on both real-world and simulated datasets show our method outperforms common video summarization baselines by 50%</p></details> |  |

While existing works make remarkable progress on day-night domain adaptation, they rely heavily on domain knowledge derived from the task-specific nighttime dataset. This paper challenges a more complicated scenario with border applicability, i.e., zero-shot day-night domain adaptation, which eliminates reliance on any nighttime data. Unlike prior zero-shot adaptation approaches emphasizing either image-level translation or model-level adaptation, we propose a similarity min-max paradigm that considers them under a unified framework. On the image level, we darken images towards minimum feature similarity to enlarge the domain gap. Then on the model level, we maximize the feature similarity between the darkened images and their normal-light counterparts for better model adaptation. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the pioneering effort in jointly optimizing both aspects, resulting in a significant improvement of model generalizability. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method's effectiveness and broad applicability on various nighttime vision tasks, including classification, semantic segmentation, visual place recognition, and video action recognition.

Current methods either rely heavily on GNSS, face limitations in visual-based localization due to appearance variances and stylistic dissimilarities between camera and reference imagery, or operate under the assumption of a known initial pose. In this paper, we developed a GNSS-denied localization approach for UAVs that harnesses both Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) and Visual Place Recognition (VPR) using a foundation model. This paper presents a novel vision-based pipeline that works exclusively with a nadir-facing camera, an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), and pre-existing satellite imagery for robust, accurate localization in varied environments and conditions. Our system demonstrated average localization accuracy within a $20$-meter range, with a minimum error below $1$ meter, under real-world conditions marked by drastic changes in environmental appearance and with no assumption of the vehicle's initial pose. The method is proven to be effective and robust, addressing the crucial need for reliable UAV localization in GNSS-denied environments, while also being computationally efficient enough to be deployed on resource-constrained platforms.</p></details> |  |

Recently, an approach for synthesizing database images from unseen viewpoints using NeRF (Neural Radiance Fields) technology has emerged with impressive performance. However, synthesized images provided by these techniques are often of lower quality than the original images, and furthermore they significantly increase the storage cost of the database. In this study, we explore a new hybrid scene model that combines the advantages of view-invariant appearance features computed from raw images and view-dependent spatial-semantic features computed from synthesized images. These two types of features are then fused into scene graphs, and compressively learned and recognized by a graph neural network. The effectiveness of the proposed method was verified using a novel cross-view self-localization dataset with many unseen views generated using a photorealistic Habitat simulator.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 5 figures, technical report</p></details> |

VPR is particularly difficult due to the presence of duplicate regions and the lack of attention to small objects in complex scenes, resulting in recognition deviations. In this paper, we present ClusVPR, a novel approach that tackles the specific issues of redundant information in duplicate regions and representations of small objects. Different from existing methods that rely on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature map generation, ClusVPR introduces a unique paradigm called Clustering-based Weighted Transformer Network (CWTNet). CWTNet leverages the power of clustering-based weighted feature maps and integrates global dependencies to effectively address visual deviations encountered in large-scale VPR problems. We also introduce the optimized-VLAD (OptLAD) layer that significantly reduces the number of parameters and enhances model efficiency. This layer is specifically designed to aggregate the information obtained from scale-wise image patches. Additionally, our pyramid self-supervised strategy focuses on extracting representative and diverse information from scale-wise image patches instead of entire images, which is crucial for capturing representative and diverse information in VPR. Extensive experiments on four VPR datasets show our model's superior performance compared to existing models while being less complex.</p></details> |  |
| **[Collaborative Visual Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05541v1)** | 2023-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual place recognition (VPR) capabilities enable autonomous robots to navigate complex environments by discovering the environment's topology based on visual input. Most research efforts focus on enhancing the accuracy and robustness of single-robot VPR but often encounter issues such as occlusion due to individual viewpoints. Despite a number of research on multi-robot metric-based localization, there is a notable gap in research concerning more robust and efficient place-based localization with a multi-robot system. This work proposes collaborative VPR, where multiple robots share abstracted visual features to enhance place recognition capabilities. We also introduce a novel collaborative VPR framework based on similarity-regularized information fusion, reducing irrelevant noise while harnessing valuable data from collaborators. This framework seamlessly integrates with well-established single-robot VPR techniques and supports end-to-end training with a weakly-supervised contrastive loss. We conduct experiments in urban, rural, and indoor scenes, achieving a notable improvement over single-agent VPR in urban environments (~12\%), along with consistent enhancements in rural (~3\%) and indoor (~1\%) scenarios. Our work presents a promising solution to the pressing challenges of VPR, representing a substantial step towards safe and robust autonomous systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://ai4ce.github.io/CoVPR/</p></details> |
| **[AANet: Aggregation and Alignment Network with Semi-hard Positive Sample Mining for Hierarchical Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05184v1)** | 2023-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual place recognition (VPR) is one of the research hotspots in robotics, which uses visual information to locate robots. Recently, the hierarchical two-stage VPR methods have become popular in this field due to the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. These methods retrieve the top-k candidate images using the global features in the first stage, then re-rank the candidates by matching the local features in the second stage. However, they usually require additional algorithms (e.g. RANSAC) for geometric consistency verification in re-ranking, which is time-consuming. Here we propose a Dynamically Aligning Local Features (DALF) algorithm to align the local features under spatial constraints. It is significantly more efficient than the methods that need geometric consistency verification. We present a unified network capable of extracting global features for retrieving candidates via an aggregation module and aligning local features for re-ranking via the DALF alignment module. We call this network AANet. Meanwhile, many works use the simplest positive samples in triplet for weakly supervised training, which limits the ability of the network to recognize harder positive pairs. To address this issue, we propose a Semi-hard Positive Sample Mining (ShPSM) strategy to select appropriate hard positive images for training more robust VPR networks. Extensive experiments on four benchmark VPR datasets show that the proposed AANet can outperform several state-of-the-art methods with less time consumption. The code is released at https://github.com/Lu-Feng/AANet.</p></details> | ICRA2023 |

To address this issue, we propose a novel method that effectively leverages the strengths of vision transformers. By employing a meticulous selection process, our approach identifies and isolates specific patches within the image that correspond to occluding objects. To evaluate the efficacy of our method, we created augmented datasets and conducted comprehensive testing. The results demonstrate the superior accuracy achieved by our proposed approach. This research contributes to the advancement of landmark detection in visual place recognition and shows the potential of leveraging vision transformers to overcome challenges posed by cluttered real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |

This is typically done through image retrieval, where the query is matched to the most similar images from a large database of geotagged photos, using learned global descriptors. A major challenge in this task is recognizing places seen from different viewpoints. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new method, called EigenPlaces, to train our neural network on images from different point of views, which embeds viewpoint robustness into the learned global descriptors. The underlying idea is to cluster the training data so as to explicitly present the model with different views of the same points of interest. The selection of this points of interest is done without the need for extra supervision. We then present experiments on the most comprehensive set of datasets in literature, finding that EigenPlaces is able to outperform previous state of the art on the majority of datasets, while requiring 60\% less GPU memory for training and using 50\% smaller descriptors. The code and trained models for EigenPlaces are available at {\small{\url{https://github.com/gmberton/EigenPlaces}}}, while results with any other baseline can be computed with the codebase at {\small{\url{https://github.com/gmberton/auto_VPR}}}.</p></details> | ICCV 2023 |

Currently, the two main approaches are the perspective view retrieval (P2P) paradigm and the equirectangular image retrieval (E2E) paradigm. However, it is practical and natural to assume that users only have consumer-grade pinhole cameras to obtain query perspective images and retrieve them in panoramic database images from map providers. To address this, we propose \textit{PanoVPR}, a perspective-to-equirectangular (P2E) visual place recognition framework that employs sliding windows to eliminate feature truncation caused by hard cropping. Specifically, PanoVPR slides windows over the entire equirectangular image and computes feature descriptors for each window, which are then compared to determine place similarity. Notably, our unified framework enables direct transfer of the backbone from P2P methods without any modification, supporting not only CNNs but also Transformers. To facilitate training and evaluation, we derive the Pitts250k-P2E dataset from the Pitts250k and establish YQ360, latter is the first P2E visual place recognition dataset collected by a mobile robot platform aiming to simulate real-world task scenarios better. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PanoVPR achieves state-of-the-art performance and obtains 3.8% and 8.0% performance gain on Pitts250k-P2E and YQ360 compared to the previous best method, respectively.

| **[HumanDreamer-X: Photorealistic Single-image Human Avatars Reconstruction via Gaussian Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03536v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Single-image human reconstruction is vital for digital human modeling applications but remains an extremely challenging task. Current approaches rely on generative models to synthesize multi-view images for subsequent 3D reconstruction and animation. However, directly generating multiple views from a single human image suffers from geometric inconsistencies, resulting in issues like fragmented or blurred limbs in the reconstructed models. To tackle these limitations, we introduce \textbf{HumanDreamer-X}, a novel framework that integrates multi-view human generation and reconstruction into a unified pipeline, which significantly enhances the geometric consistency and visual fidelity of the reconstructed 3D models. In this framework, 3D Gaussian Splatting serves as an explicit 3D representation to provide initial geometry and appearance priority. Building upon this foundation, \textbf{HumanFixer} is trained to restore 3DGS renderings, which guarantee photorealistic results. Furthermore, we delve into the inherent challenges associated with attention mechanisms in multi-view human generation, and propose an attention modulation strategy that effectively enhances geometric details identity consistency across multi-view. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach markedly improves generation and reconstruction PSNR quality metrics by 16.45% and 12.65%, respectively, achieving a PSNR of up to 25.62 dB, while also showing generalization capabilities on in-the-wild data and applicability to various human reconstruction backbone models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://humandreamer-x.github.io/</p></details> |

However, it often struggles to capture rich details and complete geometry. Our analysis reveals that the 3D-GS densification operation lacks adaptiveness and faces a dilemma between geometry coverage and detail recovery. To address this, we introduce a novel densification operation, residual split, which adds a downscaled Gaussian as a residual. Our approach is capable of adaptively retrieving details and complementing missing geometry. To further support this method, we propose a pipeline named ResGS. Specifically, we integrate a Gaussian image pyramid for progressive supervision and implement a selection scheme that prioritizes the densification of coarse Gaussians over time. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves SOTA rendering quality. Consistent performance improvements can be achieved by applying our residual split on various 3D-GS variants, underscoring its versatility and potential for broader application in 3D-GS-based applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Compressing 3D Gaussian Splatting by Noise-Substituted Vector Quantization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03059v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in 3D reconstruction, achieving high-quality results with real-time radiance field rendering. However, a key challenge is the substantial storage cost: reconstructing a single scene typically requires millions of Gaussian splats, each represented by 59 floating-point parameters, resulting in approximately 1~GB of memory. To address this challenge, we propose a compression method by building separate attribute codebooks and storing only discrete code indices. Specifically, we employ noise-substituted vector quantization technique to jointly train the codebooks and model features, ensuring consistency between gradient descent optimization and parameter discretization. Our method reduces the memory consumption efficiently (around $45\times$) while maintaining competitive reconstruction quality on standard 3D benchmark scenes. Experiments on different codebook sizes show the trade-off between compression ratio and image quality. Furthermore, the trained compressed model remains fully compatible with popular 3DGS viewers and enables faster rendering speed, making it well-suited for practical applications.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods relying on dense point clouds and triangular meshes struggle with moving objects, occlusions, and real-time processing constraints, limiting their effectiveness in complex urban environments. While multi-view stereo and neural radiance fields have advanced 3D reconstruction, they face challenges in computational efficiency and handling scene dynamics. This paper proposes a novel 3D Gaussian point distribution method for dynamic street scene reconstruction. Our approach introduces an adaptive transparency mechanism that eliminates moving objects while preserving high-fidelity static scene details. Additionally, iterative refinement of Gaussian point distribution enhances geometric accuracy and texture representation. We integrate directional encoding with spatial position optimization to optimize storage and rendering efficiency, reducing redundancy while maintaining scene integrity. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves high reconstruction quality, improved rendering performance, and adaptability in large-scale dynamic environments. These contributions establish a robust framework for real-time, high-precision 3D reconstruction, advancing the practicality of dynamic scene modeling across multiple applications.</p></details> |  |

While previous 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS)-based methods largely depended on depth sensors, our approach reduces the hardware dependency and only requires RGB input, leveraging online visual odometry (VO) to generate sparse point clouds in real-time. To reduce redundancy and enhance the quality of 3D scene reconstruction, we implemented a series of methodological enhancements in 3D Gaussian mapping. Firstly, we introduced dynamic 3D Gaussian insertion to avoid adding redundant Gaussians in previously well-reconstructed areas. Secondly, we introduced clarity-enhancing Gaussian densification module and planar regularization to handle texture-less areas and flat surfaces better. We achieved precise camera tracking results both on the synthetic Replica and real-world TUM-RGBD datasets, comparable to those of the state-of-the-art. Additionally, our method realized a significant 5.57x improvement in frames per second (fps) over the previous state-of-the-art, MonoGS.</p></details> |  |

While state-of-the-art methods leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting with score distillation to enhance multi-view rendering through pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models, they suffer from inherent view biases in T2I priors. These biases lead to inconsistent 3D generation, particularly manifesting as the multi-face Janus problem, where objects exhibit conflicting features across views. To address this fundamental challenge, we propose ConsDreamer, a novel framework that mitigates view bias by refining both the conditional and unconditional terms in the score distillation process: (1) a View Disentanglement Module (VDM) that eliminates viewpoint biases in conditional prompts by decoupling irrelevant view components and injecting precise camera parameters; and (2) a similarity-based partial order loss that enforces geometric consistency in the unconditional term by aligning cosine similarities with azimuth relationships. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConsDreamer effectively mitigates the multi-face Janus problem in text-to-3D generation, outperforming existing methods in both visual quality and consistency.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 11 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Specifically, our approach focuses on synthesizing foreground components, such as various human instances in motion within complex scene backgrounds, from UAV perspectives. This is achieved by integrating 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for reconstructing backgrounds along with controllable synthetic human models that display diverse appearances and actions in multiple poses. To the best of our knowledge, UAVTwin is the first approach for UAV-based perception that is capable of generating high-fidelity digital twins based on 3DGS. The proposed work significantly enhances downstream models through data augmentation for real-world environments with multiple dynamic objects and significant appearance variations-both of which typically introduce artifacts in 3DGS-based modeling. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel appearance modeling strategy and a mask refinement module to enhance the training of 3D Gaussian Splatting. We demonstrate the high quality of neural rendering by achieving a 1.23 dB improvement in PSNR compared to recent methods. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of data augmentation by showing a 2.5% to 13.7% improvement in mAP for the human detection task.</p></details> |  |
| **[MaskGaussian: Adaptive 3D Gaussian Representation from Probabilistic Masks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20522v2)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable performance in novel view synthesis and real-time rendering, the high memory consumption due to the use of millions of Gaussians limits its practicality. To mitigate this issue, improvements have been made by pruning unnecessary Gaussians, either through a hand-crafted criterion or by using learned masks. However, these methods deterministically remove Gaussians based on a snapshot of the pruning moment, leading to sub-optimized reconstruction performance from a long-term perspective. To address this issue, we introduce MaskGaussian, which models Gaussians as probabilistic entities rather than permanently removing them, and utilize them according to their probability of existence. To achieve this, we propose a masked-rasterization technique that enables unused yet probabilistically existing Gaussians to receive gradients, allowing for dynamic assessment of their contribution to the evolving scene and adjustment of their probability of existence. Hence, the importance of Gaussians iteratively changes and the pruned Gaussians are selected diversely. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in achieving better rendering quality with fewer Gaussians than previous pruning methods, pruning over 60% of Gaussians on average with only a 0.02 PSNR decline.

However, these methods struggle in large-scale, unconstrained environments where sparse and uneven input coverage, transient occlusions, appearance variability, and inconsistent camera settings lead to degraded quality. We propose GS-Diff, a novel 3DGS framework guided by a multi-view diffusion model to address these limitations. By generating pseudo-observations conditioned on multi-view inputs, our method transforms under-constrained 3D reconstruction problems into well-posed ones, enabling robust optimization even with sparse data. GS-Diff further integrates several enhancements, including appearance embedding, monocular depth priors, dynamic object modeling, anisotropy regularization, and advanced rasterization techniques, to tackle geometric and photometric challenges in real-world settings. Experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that GS-Diff consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by significant margins.</p></details> | <details><summary>WACV ...</summary><p>WACV ULTRRA Workshop 2025</p></details> |

Its framework provides fast and high-fidelity rendering. Although less complex than other solutions such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), there are still some challenges building smaller models without sacrificing quality. In this study, we perform a careful analysis of 3DGS training process and propose a new optimization methodology. Our Better Optimized Gaussian Splatting (BOGausS) solution is able to generate models up to ten times lighter than the original 3DGS with no quality degradation, thus significantly boosting the performance of Gaussian Splatting compared to the state of the art.</p></details> |  |
| **[FlowR: Flowing from Sparse to Dense 3D Reconstructions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01647v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian splatting enables high-quality novel view synthesis (NVS) at real-time frame rates. However, its quality drops sharply as we depart from the training views. Thus, dense captures are needed to match the high-quality expectations of some applications, e.g. Virtual Reality (VR). However, such dense captures are very laborious and expensive to obtain. Existing works have explored using 2D generative models to alleviate this requirement by distillation or generating additional training views. These methods are often conditioned only on a handful of reference input views and thus do not fully exploit the available 3D information, leading to inconsistent generation results and reconstruction artifacts. To tackle this problem, we propose a multi-view, flow matching model that learns a flow to connect novel view renderings from possibly sparse reconstructions to renderings that we expect from dense reconstructions. This enables augmenting scene captures with novel, generated views to improve reconstruction quality. Our model is trained on a novel dataset of 3.6M image pairs and can process up to 45 views at 540x960 resolution (91K tokens) on one H100 GPU in a single forward pass. Our pipeline consistently improves NVS in sparse- and dense-view scenarios, leading to higher-quality reconstructions than prior works across multiple, widely-used NVS benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page is available at https://tobiasfshr.github.io/pub/flowr</p></details> |

However, previous methods utilize 3D priors that lack detailed and complex structural information, limiting them to generating simple objects and presenting challenges for creating intricate structures such as bonsai. In this paper, we propose 3DBonsai, a novel text-to-3D framework for generating 3D bonsai with complex structures. Technically, we first design a trainable 3D space colonization algorithm to produce bonsai structures, which are then enhanced through random sampling and point cloud augmentation to serve as the 3D Gaussian priors. We introduce two bonsai generation pipelines with distinct structural levels: fine structure conditioned generation, which initializes 3D Gaussians using a 3D structure prior to produce detailed and complex bonsai, and coarse structure conditioned generation, which employs a multi-view structure consistency module to align 2D and 3D structures. Moreover, we have compiled a unified 2D and 3D Chinese-style bonsai dataset. Our experimental results demonstrate that 3DBonsai significantly outperforms existing methods, providing a new benchmark for structure-aware 3D bonsai generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICME 2025</p></details> |

However, existing methods often struggle to accurately capture the dynamics of loose clothing, as they primarily rely on global pose conditioning or static per-frame representations, leading to oversmoothing and temporal inconsistencies in non-rigid regions. To address this, We propose RealityAvatar, an efficient framework for high-fidelity digital human modeling, specifically targeting loosely dressed avatars. Our method leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting to capture complex clothing deformations and motion dynamics while ensuring geometric consistency. By incorporating a motion trend module and a latentbone encoder, we explicitly model pose-dependent deformations and temporal variations in clothing behavior. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in capturing fine-grained clothing deformations and motion-driven shape variations. Our method significantly enhances structural fidelity and perceptual quality in dynamic human reconstruction, particularly in non-rigid regions, while achieving better consistency across temporal frames.</p></details> |  |

This challenge becomes more pronounced in multi-view scenarios, where variations in lighting and image signal processor (ISP) settings across viewpoints introduce photometric inconsistencies. Such lighting degradations and view-dependent variations pose substantial challenges to novel view synthesis (NVS) frameworks based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). To address this, we introduce Luminance-GS, a novel approach to achieving high-quality novel view synthesis results under diverse challenging lighting conditions using 3DGS. By adopting per-view color matrix mapping and view-adaptive curve adjustments, Luminance-GS achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results across various lighting conditions -- including low-light, overexposure, and varying exposure -- while not altering the original 3DGS explicit representation. Compared to previous NeRF- and 3DGS-based baselines, Luminance-GS provides real-time rendering speed with improved reconstruction quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025, project page: https://cuiziteng.github.io/Luminance_GS_web/</p></details> |

However, these methods typically bake illumination into their representations, limiting their use for physically-based rendering and scene editing. Although recent inverse rendering approaches aim to decompose scenes into material and lighting components, they often rely on simplifying assumptions that fail when editing. We present a novel approach that enables efficient global illumination for 3D Gaussians Splatting through screen-space ray tracing. Our key insight is that a substantial amount of indirect light can be traced back to surfaces visible within the current view frustum. Leveraging this observation, we augment the direct shading computed by 3D Gaussians with Monte-Carlo screen-space ray-tracing to capture one-bounce indirect illumination. In this way, our method enables realistic global illumination without sacrificing the computational efficiency and editability benefits of 3D Gaussians. Through experiments, we show that the screen-space approximation we utilize allows for indirect illumination and supports real-time rendering and editing.

Hands-on aerial robotics courses are pivotal in training the next-generation workforce to meet the growing market demands. Such an efficient and compelling course depends on a reliable testbed.

Unlike traditional NeRF-based methods, which are computationally demanding and restrict active mapping performance, our approach leverages the efficient rendering capabilities of 3DGS, allowing effective and efficient exploration in complex environments. The core of our system is a rendering-based information gain module that dynamically identifies the most informative viewpoints for next-best-view planning, enhancing both geometric and photometric reconstruction accuracy. ActiveGAMER also integrates a carefully balanced framework, combining coarse-to-fine exploration, post-refinement, and a global-local keyframe selection strategy to maximize reconstruction completeness and fidelity. Our system autonomously explores and reconstructs environments with state-of-the-art geometric and photometric accuracy and completeness, significantly surpassing existing approaches in both aspects. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets such as Replica and MP3D highlight ActiveGAMER's effectiveness in active mapping tasks.</p></details> | Accepted to CVPR2025 |
| **[DropGaussian: Structural Regularization for Sparse-view Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00773v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has gained considerable attentions in the field of novel view synthesis due to its fast performance while yielding the excellent image quality. However, 3DGS in sparse-view settings (e.g., three-view inputs) often faces with the problem of overfitting to training views, which significantly drops the visual quality of novel view images. Many existing approaches have tackled this issue by using strong priors, such as 2D generative contextual information and external depth signals. In contrast, this paper introduces a prior-free method, so-called DropGaussian, with simple changes in 3D Gaussian splatting. Specifically, we randomly remove Gaussians during the training process in a similar way of dropout, which allows non-excluded Gaussians to have larger gradients while improving their visibility. This makes the remaining Gaussians to contribute more to the optimization process for rendering with sparse input views. Such simple operation effectively alleviates the overfitting problem and enhances the quality of novel view synthesis. By simply applying DropGaussian to the original 3DGS framework, we can achieve the competitive performance with existing prior-based 3DGS methods in sparse-view settings of benchmark datasets without any additional complexity.

However, existing methods fail to perform instance-aware decomposition without manual annotations, which is crucial for instance-level scene editing.We propose UnIRe, a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) based approach that decomposes a scene into a static background and individual dynamic instances using only RGB images and LiDAR point clouds. At its core, we introduce 4D superpoints, a novel representation that clusters multi-frame LiDAR points in 4D space, enabling unsupervised instance separation based on spatiotemporal correlations. These 4D superpoints serve as the foundation for our decomposed 4D initialization, i.e., providing spatial and temporal initialization to train a dynamic 3DGS for arbitrary dynamic classes without requiring bounding boxes or object templates.Furthermore, we introduce a smoothness regularization strategy in both 2D and 3D space, further improving the temporal stability.Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms existing methods in decomposed dynamic scene reconstruction while enabling accurate and flexible instance-level editing, making it a practical solution for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

Compared with previous 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods that requires elusive multi-view datasets or tedious personalized learning/inference, MGGtalk enables more practical and broader applications. However, in the absence of multi-view and personalized training data, the incompleteness of geometric and appearance information poses a significant challenge. To address these challenges, MGGTalk explores depth information to enhance geometric and facial symmetry characteristics to supplement both geometric and appearance features. Initially, based on the pixel-wise geometric information obtained from depth estimation, we incorporate symmetry operations and point cloud filtering techniques to ensure a complete and precise position parameter for 3DGS. Subsequently, we adopt a two-stage strategy with symmetric priors for predicting the remaining 3DGS parameters. We begin by predicting Gaussian parameters for the visible facial regions of the source image. These parameters are subsequently utilized to improve the prediction of Gaussian parameters for the non-visible regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MGGTalk surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior performance across various metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

Although 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently demonstrated high-quality results with real-time performance, it still faces challenges in indoor scenes with large, textureless regions, resulting in incomplete and noisy reconstructions due to poor point cloud initialization and underconstrained optimization. Inspired by the continuity of signed distance field (SDF), which naturally has advantages in modeling surfaces, we propose a unified optimization framework that integrates neural signed distance fields (SDFs) with 3DGS for accurate geometry reconstruction and real-time rendering. This framework incorporates a neural SDF field to guide the densification and pruning of Gaussians, enabling Gaussians to model scenes accurately even with poor initialized point clouds. Simultaneously, the geometry represented by Gaussians improves the efficiency of the SDF field by piloting its point sampling. Additionally, we introduce two regularization terms based on normal and edge priors to resolve geometric ambiguities in textureless areas and enhance detail accuracy. Extensive experiments in ScanNet and ScanNet++ show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both surface reconstruction and novel view synthesis.</p></details> |  |

Our approach reconstructs the full scene in a 3D Gaussian Splatting representation at a given target ('bullet') timestamp by aggregating information from all the context frames. Such a formulation allows BTimer to gain scalability and generalization by leveraging both static and dynamic scene datasets. Given a casual monocular dynamic video, BTimer reconstructs a bullet-time scene within 150ms while reaching state-of-the-art performance on both static and dynamic scene datasets, even compared with optimization-based approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://research.nvidia.com/labs/toronto-ai/bullet-timer/</p></details> |

Typically, immersive and realistic scenes should be free from obstructions by dynamic objects, maintain global texture consistency, and allow for unrestricted exploration. The current mainstream methods for image-driven scene construction involves iteratively refining the initial image using a moving virtual camera to generate the scene. However, previous methods struggle with visual discontinuities due to global texture inconsistencies under varying camera poses, and they frequently exhibit scene voids caused by foreground-background occlusions. To this end, we propose a novel layered 3D scene reconstruction framework from panoramic image, named Scene4U. Specifically, Scene4U integrates an open-vocabulary segmentation model with a large language model to decompose a real panorama into multiple layers. Then, we employs a layered repair module based on diffusion model to restore occluded regions using visual cues and depth information, generating a hierarchical representation of the scene. The multi-layer panorama is then initialized as a 3D Gaussian Splatting representation, followed by layered optimization, which ultimately produces an immersive 3D scene with semantic and structural consistency that supports free exploration. Scene4U outperforms state-of-the-art method, improving by 24.24% in LPIPS and 24.40% in BRISQUE, while also achieving the fastest training speed. Additionally, to demonstrate the robustness of Scene4U and allow users to experience immersive scenes from various landmarks, we build WorldVista3D dataset for 3D scene reconstruction, which contains panoramic images of globally renowned sites. The implementation code and dataset will be released at https://github.com/LongHZ140516/Scene4U .</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025, 11 pages, 7 figures</p></details> |

Inspired by this intuition, we propose Visual Acoustic Fields, a framework that bridges hitting sounds and visual signals within a 3D space using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Our approach features two key modules: sound generation and sound localization. The sound generation module leverages a conditional diffusion model, which takes multiscale features rendered from a feature-augmented 3DGS to generate realistic hitting sounds. Meanwhile, the sound localization module enables querying the 3D scene, represented by the feature-augmented 3DGS, to localize hitting positions based on the sound sources. To support this framework, we introduce a novel pipeline for collecting scene-level visual-sound sample pairs, achieving alignment between captured images, impact locations, and corresponding sounds. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first dataset to connect visual and acoustic signals in a 3D context. Extensive experiments on our dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of Visual Acoustic Fields in generating plausible impact sounds and accurately localizing impact sources.

To address these issues, we propose LITA-GS, a novel illumination-agnostic novel view synthesis method via reference-free 3DGS and physical priors. Firstly, we introduce an illumination-invariant physical prior extraction pipeline. Secondly, based on the extracted robust spatial structure prior, we develop the lighting-agnostic structure rendering strategy, which facilitates the optimization of the scene structure and object appearance. Moreover, a progressive denoising module is introduced to effectively mitigate the noise within the light-invariant representation.

Most variants rely on the same core algorithm: depth-sorting of Gaussian splats then rasterizing in primitive order. This ensures correct alpha compositing, but can cause rendering artifacts due to built-in approximations. Moreover, for a fixed representation, sorted rendering offers little control over render cost and visual fidelity. For example, and counter-intuitively, rendering a lower-resolution image is not necessarily faster. In this work, we address the above limitations by combining 3D Gaussian splatting with stochastic rasterization. Concretely, we leverage an unbiased Monte Carlo estimator of the volume rendering equation. This removes the need for sorting, and allows for accurate 3D blending of overlapping Gaussians. The number of Monte Carlo samples further imbues 3DGS with a way to trade off computation time and quality. We implement our method using OpenGL shaders, enabling efficient rendering on modern GPU hardware. At a reasonable visual quality, our method renders more than four times faster than sorted rasterization.</p></details> |  |

It encodes images into a 3D Gaussian particle representation, propagates dynamics via a transformer, and renders frames using 3D Gaussian splatting. By jointly training inverse rendering with a dynamics transformer using a temporal encoding and merging layer, 3DGSimembeds physical properties into point-wise latent vectors without enforcing explicit connectivity constraints. This enables the model to capture diverse physical behaviors, from rigid to elastic and cloth-like interactions, along with realistic lighting effects that also generalize to unseen multi-body interactions and novel scene edits.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the partial priors provided by single-view input, existing methods are often limited to reconstruct low-consistency 3D scenes with narrow fields of view from single-view input. These limitations make them less capable of generalizing to reconstruct immersive scenes. To address this problem, we propose ExScene, a two-stage pipeline to reconstruct an immersive 3D scene from any given single-view image. ExScene designs a novel multimodal diffusion model to generate a high-fidelity and globally consistent panoramic image. We then develop a panoramic depth estimation approach to calculate geometric information from panorama, and we combine geometric information with high-fidelity panoramic image to train an initial 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model. Following this, we introduce a GS refinement technique with 2D stable video diffusion priors. We add camera trajectory consistency and color-geometric priors into the denoising process of diffusion to improve color and spatial consistency across image sequences. These refined sequences are then used to fine-tune the initial 3DGS model, leading to better reconstruction quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our ExScene achieves consistent and immersive scene reconstruction using only single-view input, significantly surpassing state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | ICME 2025 |

We tackle three major challenges. First, training a controllable 3D generative network requires a large number of diverse sequences, for which pairs of images and high-quality tracked meshes are not always available. Second, the use of real data is strictly regulated (e.g., under the General Data Protection Regulation, which mandates frequent deletion of models and data to accommodate a situation when a participant's consent is withdrawn). Synthetic data, free from these constraints, is an appealing alternative. Third, state-of-the-art monocular avatar models struggle to generalize to new views and expressions, lacking a strong prior and often overfitting to a specific viewpoint distribution. Inspired by machine learning models trained solely on synthetic data, we propose a method that learns a prior model from a large dataset of synthetic heads with diverse identities, expressions, and viewpoints. With few input images, SynShot fine-tunes the pretrained synthetic prior to bridge the domain gap, modeling a photorealistic head avatar that generalizes to novel expressions and viewpoints. We model the head avatar using 3D Gaussian splatting and a convolutional encoder-decoder that outputs Gaussian parameters in UV texture space. To account for the different modeling complexities over parts of the head (e.g., skin vs hair), we embed the prior with explicit control for upsampling the number of per-part primitives. Compared to SOTA monocular and GAN-based methods, SynShot significantly improves novel view and expression synthesis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR25 Website: https://zielon.github.io/synshot/</p></details> |

In this paper, we introduce a robust watermarking method for 3D-GS that secures copyright of both the model and its rendered images. Our proposed method remains robust against distortions in rendered images and model attacks while maintaining high rendering quality. To achieve these objectives, we present Frequency-Guided Densification (FGD), which removes 3D Gaussians based on their contribution to rendering quality, enhancing real-time rendering and the robustness of the message. FGD utilizes Discrete Fourier Transform to split 3D Gaussians in high-frequency areas, improving rendering quality. Furthermore, we employ a gradient mask for 3D Gaussians and design a wavelet-subband loss to enhance rendering quality. Our experiments show that our method embeds the message in the rendered images invisibly and robustly against various attacks, including model distortion. Our method achieves superior performance in both rendering quality and watermark robustness while improving real-time rendering efficiency.

Existing methods typically utilize generative models to perform text-guided editing on 3D representations, such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). However, these methods are often limited to texture modifications and fail when addressing geometric changes, such as editing a character's head to turn around. Moreover, such methods lack accurate control over the spatial position of editing results, as language struggles to precisely describe the extent of edits. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DYG, an effective 3D drag-based editing method for 3D Gaussian Splatting. It enables users to conveniently specify the desired editing region and the desired dragging direction through the input of 3D masks and pairs of control points, thereby enabling precise control over the extent of editing. DYG integrates the strengths of the implicit triplane representation to establish the geometric scaffold of the editing results, effectively overcoming suboptimal editing outcomes caused by the sparsity of 3DGS in the desired editing regions. Additionally, we incorporate a drag-based Latent Diffusion Model into our method through the proposed Drag-SDS loss function, enabling flexible, multi-view consistent, and fine-grained editing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DYG conducts effective drag-based editing guided by control point prompts, surpassing other baselines in terms of editing effect and quality, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Recently, inspired by the remarkable success of NVS using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), researchers have sought to extend 3D Gaussian models to four dimensions (4D) for dynamic novel-view synthesis. However, methods based on 4D rotation and scaling introduce spatiotemporal deformation into the 4D covariance matrix, necessitating the slicing of 4D Gaussians into 3D Gaussians. This process increases redundant computations as timestamps change-an inherent characteristic of dynamic scene rendering. Additionally, performing calculations on a four-dimensional matrix is computationally intensive. In this paper, we introduce Disentangled 4D Gaussian Splatting (Disentangled4DGS), a novel representation and rendering approach that disentangles temporal and spatial deformations, thereby eliminating the reliance on 4D matrix computations. We extend the 3DGS rendering process to 4D, enabling the projection of temporal and spatial deformations into dynamic 2D Gaussians in ray space. Consequently, our method facilitates faster dynamic scene synthesis. Moreover, it reduces storage requirements by at least 4.5\% due to our efficient presentation method. Our approach achieves an unprecedented average rendering speed of 343 FPS at a resolution of $1352\times1014$ on an RTX 3090 GPU, with experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrating its competitive performance in both monocular and multi-view scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, despite its effectiveness on high-end GPUs, it struggles on edge systems like the Jetson Orin NX Edge GPU, achieving only 7-17 FPS -- well below the over 60 FPS standard required for truly immersive AR/VR experiences. Addressing this challenge, we perform a comprehensive analysis of Gaussian-based AR/VR applications and identify the Gaussian Blending Stage, which intensively calculates each Gaussian's contribution at every pixel, as the primary bottleneck. In response, we propose a Gaussian Blending Unit (GBU), an edge GPU plug-in module for real-time rendering in AR/VR applications. Notably, our GBU can be seamlessly integrated into conventional edge GPUs and collaboratively supports a wide range of AR/VR applications. Specifically, GBU incorporates an intra-row sequential shading (IRSS) dataflow that shades each row of pixels sequentially from left to right, utilizing a two-step coordinate transformation. When directly deployed on a GPU, the proposed dataflow achieved a non-trivial 1.72x speedup on real-world static scenes, though still falls short of real-time rendering performance. Recognizing the limited compute utilization in the GPU-based implementation, GBU enhances rendering speed with a dedicated rendering engine that balances the workload across rows by aggregating computations from multiple Gaussians. Experiments across representative AR/VR applications demonstrate that our GBU provides a unified solution for on-device real-time rendering while maintaining SOTA rendering quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by HPCA 2025</p></details> |

However, the substantial cost of storage and transmission of vanilla 3DGS hinders its further application (hundreds of megabytes or even gigabytes for a single scene). Motivated by the achievements of prediction in video compression, we introduce the prediction technique into the anchor-based Gaussian representation to effectively reduce the bit rate. Specifically, we propose a spatial condition-based prediction module to utilize the grid-captured scene information for prediction, with a residual compensation strategy designed to learn the missing fine-grained information. Besides, to further compress the residual, we propose an instance-aware hyper prior, developing a structure-aware and instance-aware entropy model. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our prediction-based compression framework and each technical component. Even compared with SOTA compression method, our framework still achieves a bit rate savings of 24.42 percent.

This ability is crucial for tasks such as vision-language navigation and autonomous robotics. However, current methods struggle because they rely heavily on fine-tuning with 3D annotations and mask proposals, which limits their ability to handle diverse semantics and common knowledge required for effective reasoning. In this work, we propose ReasonGrounder, an LVLM-guided framework that uses hierarchical 3D feature Gaussian fields for adaptive grouping based on physical scale, enabling open-vocabulary 3D grounding and reasoning. ReasonGrounder interprets implicit instructions using large vision-language models (LVLM) and localizes occluded objects through 3D Gaussian splatting. By incorporating 2D segmentation masks from the SAM and multi-view CLIP embeddings, ReasonGrounder selects Gaussian groups based on object scale, enabling accurate localization through both explicit and implicit language understanding, even in novel, occluded views. We also contribute ReasoningGD, a new dataset containing over 10K scenes and 2 million annotations for evaluating open-vocabulary 3D grounding and amodal perception under occlusion. Experiments show that ReasonGrounder significantly improves 3D grounding accuracy in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[NeuralGS: Bridging Neural Fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting for Compact 3D Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23162v1)** | 2025-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) demonstrates superior quality and rendering speed, but with millions of 3D Gaussians and significant storage and transmission costs. Recent 3DGS compression methods mainly concentrate on compressing Scaffold-GS, achieving impressive performance but with an additional voxel structure and a complex encoding and quantization strategy. In this paper, we aim to develop a simple yet effective method called NeuralGS that explores in another way to compress the original 3DGS into a compact representation without the voxel structure and complex quantization strategies. Our observation is that neural fields like NeRF can represent complex 3D scenes with Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural networks using only a few megabytes. Thus, NeuralGS effectively adopts the neural field representation to encode the attributes of 3D Gaussians with MLPs, only requiring a small storage size even for a large-scale scene. To achieve this, we adopt a clustering strategy and fit the Gaussians with different tiny MLPs for each cluster, based on importance scores of Gaussians as fitting weights. We experiment on multiple datasets, achieving a 45-times average model size reduction without harming the visual quality. The compression performance of our method on original 3DGS is comparable to the dedicated Scaffold-GS-based compression methods, which demonstrate the huge potential of directly compressing original 3DGS with neural fields.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://pku-yuangroup.github.io/NeuralGS/</p></details> |

These core issues arise from its inherently unstructured design and the absence of efficient parallelization. To overcome these challenges simultaneously, we introduce CityGS-X, a scalable architecture built on a novel parallelized hybrid hierarchical 3D representation (PH^2-3D). As an early attempt, CityGS-X abandons the cumbersome merge-and-partition process and instead adopts a newly-designed batch-level multi-task rendering process. This architecture enables efficient multi-GPU rendering through dynamic Level-of-Detail voxel allocations, significantly improving scalability and performance. Through extensive experiments, CityGS-X consistently outperforms existing methods in terms of faster training times, larger rendering capacities, and more accurate geometric details in large-scale scenes. Notably, CityGS-X can train and render a scene with 5,000+ images in just 5 hours using only 4 * 4090 GPUs, a task that would make other alternative methods encounter Out-Of-Memory (OOM) issues and fail completely. This implies that CityGS-X is far beyond the capacity of other existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://lifuguan.github.io/CityGS-X/</p></details> |
| **[FreeSplat++: Generalizable 3D Gaussian Splatting for Efficient Indoor Scene Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22986v1)** | 2025-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, the integration of the efficient feed-forward scheme into 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has been actively explored. However, most existing methods focus on sparse view reconstruction of small regions and cannot produce eligible whole-scene reconstruction results in terms of either quality or efficiency. In this paper, we propose FreeSplat++, which focuses on extending the generalizable 3DGS to become an alternative approach to large-scale indoor whole-scene reconstruction, which has the potential of significantly accelerating the reconstruction speed and improving the geometric accuracy. To facilitate whole-scene reconstruction, we initially propose the Low-cost Cross-View Aggregation framework to efficiently process extremely long input sequences. Subsequently, we introduce a carefully designed pixel-wise triplet fusion method to incrementally aggregate the overlapping 3D Gaussian primitives from multiple views, adaptively reducing their redundancy. Furthermore, we propose a weighted floater removal strategy that can effectively reduce floaters, which serves as an explicit depth fusion approach that is crucial in whole-scene reconstruction. After the feed-forward reconstruction of 3DGS primitives, we investigate a depth-regularized per-scene fine-tuning process. Leveraging the dense, multi-view consistent depth maps obtained during the feed-forward prediction phase for an extra constraint, we refine the entire scene's 3DGS primitive to enhance rendering quality while preserving geometric accuracy. Extensive experiments confirm that our FreeSplat++ significantly outperforms existing generalizable 3DGS methods, especially in whole-scene reconstructions. Compared to conventional per-scene optimized 3DGS approaches, our method with depth-regularized per-scene fine-tuning demonstrates substantial improvements in reconstruction accuracy and a notable reduction in training time.</p></details> |  |
| **[TranSplat: Lighting-Consistent Cross-Scene Object Transfer with 3D Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22676v1)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present TranSplat, a 3D scene rendering algorithm that enables realistic cross-scene object transfer (from a source to a target scene) based on the Gaussian Splatting framework. Our approach addresses two critical challenges: (1) precise 3D object extraction from the source scene, and (2) faithful relighting of the transferred object in the target scene without explicit material property estimation. TranSplat fits a splatting model to the source scene, using 2D object masks to drive fine-grained 3D segmentation. Following user-guided insertion of the object into the target scene, along with automatic refinement of position and orientation, TranSplat derives per-Gaussian radiance transfer functions via spherical harmonic analysis to adapt the object's appearance to match the target scene's lighting environment. This relighting strategy does not require explicitly estimating physical scene properties such as BRDFs. Evaluated on several synthetic and real-world scenes and objects, TranSplat yields excellent 3D object extractions and relighting performance compared to recent baseline methods and visually convincing cross-scene object transfers. We conclude by discussing the limitations of the approach.</p></details> |  |

A widely used strategy is to learn unsigned distance functions (UDFs) by checking if their appearance conforms to the image observations through neural rendering. However, it is still hard to learn continuous and implicit UDF representations through 3D Gaussians splatting (3DGS) due to the discrete and explicit scene representation, i.e., 3D Gaussians. To resolve this issue, we propose a novel approach to bridge the gap between 3D Gaussians and UDFs. Our key idea is to overfit thin and flat 2D Gaussian planes on surfaces, and then, leverage the self-supervision and gradient-based inference to supervise unsigned distances in both near and far area to surfaces. To this end, we introduce novel constraints and strategies to constrain the learning of 2D Gaussians to pursue more stable optimization and more reliable self-supervision, addressing the challenges brought by complicated gradient field on or near the zero level set of UDFs. We report numerical and visual comparisons with the state-of-the-art on widely used benchmarks and real data to show our advantages in terms of accuracy, efficiency, completeness, and sharpness of reconstructed open surfaces with boundaries.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025.

Although Scaffold-GS achieves higher quality real-time rendering compared to the original 3D-GS, its fine-grained rendering of the scene is extremely dependent on adequate viewing angles. The spectral bias of neural network learning results in Scaffold-GS's poor ability to perceive and learn high-frequency information in the scene. In this work, we propose enhancing the manifold complexity of input features and using network-based feature map loss to improve the image reconstruction quality of 3D-GS models. We introduce AH-GS, which enables 3D Gaussians in structurally complex regions to obtain higher-frequency encodings, allowing the model to more effectively learn the high-frequency information of the scene. Additionally, we incorporate high-frequency reinforce loss to further enhance the model's ability to capture detailed frequency information. Our result demonstrates that our model significantly improves rendering fidelity, and in specific scenarios (e.g., MipNeRf360-garden), our method exceeds the rendering quality of Scaffold-GS in just 15K iterations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Follow Your Motion: A Generic Temporal Consistency Portrait Editing Framework with Trajectory Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22225v1)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained conditional diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable potential in image editing. However, they often face challenges with temporal consistency, particularly in the talking head domain, where continuous changes in facial expressions intensify the level of difficulty. These issues stem from the independent editing of individual images and the inherent loss of temporal continuity during the editing process. In this paper, we introduce Follow Your Motion (FYM), a generic framework for maintaining temporal consistency in portrait editing. Specifically, given portrait images rendered by a pre-trained 3D Gaussian Splatting model, we first develop a diffusion model that intuitively and inherently learns motion trajectory changes at different scales and pixel coordinates, from the first frame to each subsequent frame. This approach ensures that temporally inconsistent edited avatars inherit the motion information from the rendered avatars. Secondly, to maintain fine-grained expression temporal consistency in talking head editing, we propose a dynamic re-weighted attention mechanism. This mechanism assigns higher weight coefficients to landmark points in space and dynamically updates these weights based on landmark loss, achieving more consistent and refined facial expressions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in terms of temporal consistency and can be used to optimize and compensate for temporally inconsistent outputs in a range of applications, such as text-driven editing, relighting, and various other applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://anonymous-hub1127.github.io/FYM.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[ABC-GS: Alignment-Based Controllable Style Transfer for 3D Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22218v1)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D scene stylization approaches based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) achieve promising results by optimizing with Nearest Neighbor Feature Matching (NNFM) loss. However, NNFM loss does not consider global style information. In addition, the implicit representation of NeRF limits their fine-grained control over the resulting scenes. In this paper, we introduce ABC-GS, a novel framework based on 3D Gaussian Splatting to achieve high-quality 3D style transfer. To this end, a controllable matching stage is designed to achieve precise alignment between scene content and style features through segmentation masks. Moreover, a style transfer loss function based on feature alignment is proposed to ensure that the outcomes of style transfer accurately reflect the global style of the reference image. Furthermore, the original geometric information of the scene is preserved with the depth loss and Gaussian regularization terms. Extensive experiments show that our ABC-GS provides controllability of style transfer and achieves stylization results that are more faithfully aligned with the global style of the chosen artistic reference.

These approaches, however, are limited by the pinhole camera model and lack effective modeling of defocus effects. Departing from this, we introduce DOF-GS--a new 3DGS-based framework with a finite-aperture camera model and explicit, differentiable defocus rendering, enabling it to function as a post-capture control tool. By training with multi-view images with moderate defocus blur, DOF-GS learns inherent camera characteristics and reconstructs sharp details of the underlying scene, particularly, enabling rendering of varying DOF effects through on-demand aperture and focal distance control, post-capture and optimization. Additionally, our framework extracts circle-of-confusion cues during optimization to identify in-focus regions in input views, enhancing the reconstructed 3D scene details. Experimental results demonstrate that DOF-GS supports post-capture refocusing, adjustable defocus and high-quality all-in-focus rendering, from multi-view images with uncalibrated defocus blur.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semantic Consistent Language Gaussian Splatting for Point-Level Open-vocabulary Querying](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21767v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary querying in 3D Gaussian Splatting aims to identify semantically relevant regions within a 3D Gaussian representation based on a given text query. Prior work, such as LangSplat, addressed this task by retrieving these regions in the form of segmentation masks on 2D renderings. More recently, OpenGaussian introduced point-level querying, which directly selects a subset of 3D Gaussians. In this work, we propose a point-level querying method that builds upon LangSplat's framework. Our approach improves the framework in two key ways: (a) we leverage masklets from the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) to establish semantic consistent ground-truth for distilling the language Gaussians; (b) we introduces a novel two-step querying approach that first retrieves the distilled ground-truth and subsequently uses the ground-truth to query the individual Gaussians. Experimental evaluations on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves better performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches. For instance, our method achieves an mIoU improvement of +20.42 on the 3D-OVS dataset.</p></details> |  |

Over the past decade, Deep Learning-based Reconstruction (DLR) methods have led efforts to enhance image quality and reduce noise, yet they often require large amounts of data and are computationally intensive. Inspired by recent advancements in scene reconstruction, some approaches have adapted NeRF and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) techniques for CT reconstruction. However, these methods are not ideal for direct 3D volume reconstruction. In this paper, we propose a novel Discretized Gaussian Representation (DGR) for CT reconstruction, which directly reconstructs the 3D volume using a set of discretized Gaussian functions in an end-to-end manner. To further enhance computational efficiency, we introduce a Fast Volume Reconstruction technique that aggregates the contributions of these Gaussians into a discretized volume in a highly parallelized fashion. Our extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that DGR achieves superior reconstruction quality and significantly improved computational efficiency compared to existing DLR and instance reconstruction methods.

In inverse rendering, accurately modeling the shading processes of objects is essential for achieving high-fidelity results. Therefore, it is critical to incorporate global illumination to account for indirect lighting that reaches an object after multiple bounces across the scene. Previous 3DGS-based methods have attempted to model indirect lighting by characterizing indirect illumination as learnable lighting volumes or additional attributes of each Gaussian, while using baked occlusion to represent shadow effects. These methods, however, fail to accurately model the complex physical interactions between light and objects, making it impossible to construct realistic indirect illumination during relighting. To address this limitation, we propose to calculate indirect lighting using efficient path tracing with deferred shading. In our framework, we first render a G-buffer to capture the detailed geometry and material properties of the scene. Then, we perform physically-based rendering (PBR) only for direct lighting. With the G-buffer and previous rendering results, the indirect lighting can be calculated through a lightweight path tracing. Our method effectively models indirect lighting under any given lighting conditions, thereby achieving better novel view synthesis and competitive relighting. Quantitative and qualitative results show that our GI-GS outperforms existing baselines in both rendering quality and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Camera-ready version.

Existing approaches mainly rely on full-length multi-view videos, while there has been limited exploration of online reconstruction methods that enable on-the-fly training and per-timestep streaming. Current 3DGS-based streaming methods treat the Gaussian primitives uniformly and constantly renew the densified Gaussians, thereby overlooking the difference between dynamic and static features as well as neglecting the temporal continuity in the scene. To address these limitations, we propose a novel three-stage pipeline for iterative streamable 4D dynamic spatial reconstruction. Our pipeline comprises a selective inheritance stage to preserve temporal continuity, a dynamics-aware shift stage to distinguish dynamic and static primitives and optimize their movements, and an error-guided densification stage to accommodate emerging objects.

Although omnidirectional images are becoming more popular since they reduce the computation required for image stitching to composite a holistic scene, existing feed-forward models are only designed for perspective images. The unique optical properties of omnidirectional images make it difficult for feature encoders to correctly understand the context of the image and make the Gaussian non-uniform in space, which hinders the image quality synthesized from novel views. We propose OmniSplat, a training-free fast feed-forward 3DGS generation framework for omnidirectional images. We adopt a Yin-Yang grid and decompose images based on it to reduce the domain gap between omnidirectional and perspective images. The Yin-Yang grid can use the existing CNN structure as it is, but its quasi-uniform characteristic allows the decomposed image to be similar to a perspective image, so it can exploit the strong prior knowledge of the learned feed-forward network. OmniSplat demonstrates higher reconstruction accuracy than existing feed-forward networks trained on perspective images.

To address this, we introduce the first approach combining event cameras, which capture high-temporal-resolution, continuous motion data, with deformable 3D-GS for dynamic scene reconstruction. We observe that threshold modeling for events plays a crucial role in achieving high-quality reconstruction. Therefore, we propose a GS-Threshold Joint Modeling strategy, creating a mutually reinforcing process that greatly improves both 3D reconstruction and threshold modeling. Moreover, we introduce a Dynamic-Static Decomposition strategy that first identifies dynamic areas by exploiting the inability of static Gaussians to represent motions, then applies a buffer-based soft decomposition to separate dynamic and static areas. This strategy accelerates rendering by avoiding unnecessary deformation in static areas, and focuses on dynamic areas to enhance fidelity. Additionally, we contribute the first event-inclusive 4D benchmark with synthetic and real-world dynamic scenes, on which our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

However, it lacks frequency interpretability, making it difficult to separate low-frequency structures from fine details. We introduce a frequency-decomposed 3D-GS framework that groups 3D Gaussians that correspond to subbands in the Laplacian Pyrmaids of the input images. Our approach enforces coherence within each subband (i.e., group of 3D Gaussians) through dedicated regularization, ensuring well-separated frequency components. We extend color values to both positive and negative ranges, allowing higher-frequency layers to add or subtract residual details. To stabilize optimization, we employ a progressive training scheme that refines details in a coarse-to-fine manner. Beyond interpretability, this frequency-aware design unlocks a range of practical benefits. Explicit frequency separation enables advanced 3D editing and stylization, allowing precise manipulation of specific frequency bands. It also supports dynamic level-of-detail control for progressive rendering, streaming, foveated rendering and fast geometry interaction. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method provides improved control and flexibility for emerging applications in scene editing and interactive rendering.

Despite recent advancements, existing methods often struggle to balance the need for accurate garment reconstruction with the ability to generalize to new poses and body shapes or require large amounts of data to achieve this. In contrast, our method only requires a multi-view capture of a single static frame. We represent garments as hybrid mesh-embedded 3D Gaussian splats, where the Gaussians capture near-field shading and high-frequency details, while the mesh encodes far-field albedo and optimized reflectance parameters. We achieve novel pose generalization by exploiting the mesh from our hybrid approach, enabling physics-based simulation and surface rendering techniques, while also capturing fine details with Gaussians that accurately reconstruct garment details. Our optimized garments can be used for simulating garments on novel poses, and garment relighting. Project page: https://phys-gaussian-cloth.github.io .</p></details> |  |

However, 3D segmentation based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) struggles with accurately delineating object boundaries, as Gaussian primitives often span across object edges due to their inherent volume and the lack of semantic guidance during training. In order to tackle these challenges, we introduce Clear Object Boundaries for 3DGS Segmentation (COB-GS), which aims to improve segmentation accuracy by clearly delineating blurry boundaries of interwoven Gaussian primitives within the scene. Unlike existing approaches that remove ambiguous Gaussians and sacrifice visual quality, COB-GS, as a 3DGS refinement method, jointly optimizes semantic and visual information, allowing the two different levels to cooperate with each other effectively. Specifically, for the semantic guidance, we introduce a boundary-adaptive Gaussian splitting technique that leverages semantic gradient statistics to identify and split ambiguous Gaussians, aligning them closely with object boundaries. For the visual optimization, we rectify the degraded suboptimal texture of the 3DGS scene, particularly along the refined boundary structures. Experimental results show that COB-GS substantially improves segmentation accuracy and robustness against inaccurate masks from pre-trained model, yielding clear boundaries while preserving high visual quality.

However, the substantial data volume of 3DGS and its attributes impede its practical utility, requiring compression techniques for reducing memory cost. Nevertheless, the unorganized shape of 3DGS leads to difficulties in compression. To formulate unstructured attributes into normative distribution, we propose a well-structured tri-plane to encode Gaussian attributes, leveraging the distribution of attributes for compression. To exploit the correlations among adjacent Gaussians, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is used when decoding Gaussian distribution from the Tri-plane. We also introduce Gaussian position information as a prior of the position-sensitive decoder. Additionally, we incorporate an adaptive wavelet loss, aiming to focus on the high-frequency details as iterations increase. Our approach has achieved results that are comparable to or surpass that of SOTA 3D Gaussians Splatting compression work in extensive experiments across multiple datasets.

We introduce EVolSplat, an efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting model for urban scenes that works in a feed-forward manner. Unlike existing feed-forward, pixel-aligned 3DGS methods, which often suffer from issues like multi-view inconsistencies and duplicated content, our approach predicts 3D Gaussians across multiple frames within a unified volume using a 3D convolutional network. This is achieved by initializing 3D Gaussians with noisy depth predictions, and then refining their geometric properties in 3D space and predicting color based on 2D textures. Our model also handles distant views and the sky with a flexible hemisphere background model. This enables us to perform fast, feed-forward reconstruction while achieving real-time rendering. Experimental evaluations on the KITTI-360 and Waymo datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art quality compared to existing feed-forward 3DGS- and NeRF-based methods.</p></details> | CVPR2025 |

While 3D-GS has proven to be a useful world model with high-quality rasterizations, it does not natively quantify uncertainty or information, posing a challenge for real-world applications such as 3D-GS SLAM. We propose to quantify information gain in 3D-GS by reformulating the problem through the lens of optimal experimental design, which is a classical solution widely used in literature. By restructuring information quantification of 3D-GS through optimal experimental design, we arrive at multiple solutions, of which T-Optimality and D-Optimality perform the best quantitatively and qualitatively as measured on two popular datasets. Additionally, we propose a block diagonal covariance approximation which provides a measure of correlation at the expense of a greater computation cost.</p></details> |  |

To account for the ill-posed nature of the setting, existing methods use deformation models with statistical, neural, or physical priors. They also predominantly rely on nonadaptive discrete surface representations (e.g. polygonal meshes), perform frame-by-frame optimisation leading to error propagation, and suffer from poor gradients of the mesh-based differentiable renderers. Consequently, fine surface details such as cloth wrinkles are often not recovered with the desired accuracy. In response to these limitations, we propose ThinShell-SfT, a new method for non-rigid 3D tracking that represents a surface as an implicit and continuous spatiotemporal neural field. We incorporate continuous thin shell physics prior based on the Kirchhoff-Love model for spatial regularisation, which starkly contrasts the discretised alternatives of earlier works. Lastly, we leverage 3D Gaussian splatting to differentiably render the surface into image space and optimise the deformations based on analysis-bysynthesis principles. Our Thin-Shell-SfT outperforms prior works qualitatively and quantitatively thanks to our continuous surface formulation in conjunction with a specially tailored simulation prior and surface-induced 3D Gaussians.

This leads to a need for intuitive and effective methods to present sensor information. However, creating intuitive sensor data visualizations presents three key challenges: the variability of sensor readings, gaps in domain comprehension, and the dynamic nature of sensor data. To address these issues, we propose Vivar, a novel system that integrates multi-modal sensor data and presents 3D volumetric content for AR visualization. In particular, we introduce a cross-modal embedding approach that maps sensor data into a pre-trained visual embedding space through barycentric interpolation. This approach accurately reflects value changes in multi-modal sensor information, ensuring that sensor variations are properly shown in visualization outcomes. Vivar also incorporates sensor-aware AR scene generation using foundation models and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) without requiring domain expertise. In addition, Vivar leverages latent reuse and caching strategies to accelerate 2D and AR content generation, demonstrating 11x latency reduction without compromising quality. A user study involving over 503 participants, including domain experts, demonstrates Vivar's effectiveness in accuracy, consistency, and real-world applicability, paving the way for more intuitive sensor data visualization.</p></details> |  |

We validate the synergy between Gaussian splatting and depth estimation through extensive ablation and cross-task transfer experiments. Our DepthSplat achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet, RealEstate10K and DL3DV datasets in terms of both depth estimation and novel view synthesis, demonstrating the mutual benefits of connecting both tasks.

Recent methods address this issue by compressing the storage size of densified Gaussians, yet fail to preserve rendering quality and efficiency. To overcome these limitations, we propose ProtoGS to learn Gaussian prototypes to represent Gaussian primitives, significantly reducing the total Gaussian amount without sacrificing visual quality. Our method directly uses Gaussian prototypes to enable efficient rendering and leverage the resulting reconstruction loss to guide prototype learning. To further optimize memory efficiency during training, we incorporate structure-from-motion (SfM) points as anchor points to group Gaussian primitives. Gaussian prototypes are derived within each group by clustering of K-means, and both the anchor points and the prototypes are optimized jointly. Our experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets prove that we outperform existing methods, achieving a substantial reduction in the number of Gaussians, and enabling high rendering speed while maintaining or even enhancing rendering fidelity.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods, which optimize per-image appearance and transient occlusion through implicit neural networks from dense training views (approximately 1000 images), struggle to perform effectively under sparse input conditions, resulting in noticeable artifacts. To this end, we propose SparseGS-W, a novel framework based on 3D Gaussian Splatting that enables the reconstruction of complex outdoor scenes and handles occlusions and appearance changes with as few as five training images. We leverage geometric priors and constrained diffusion priors to compensate for the lack of multi-view information from extremely sparse input. Specifically, we propose a plug-and-play Constrained Novel-View Enhancement module to iteratively improve the quality of rendered novel views during the Gaussian optimization process. Furthermore, we propose an Occlusion Handling module, which flexibly removes occlusions utilizing the inherent high-quality inpainting capability of constrained diffusion priors. Both modules are capable of extracting appearance features from any user-provided reference image, enabling flexible modeling of illumination-consistent scenes. Extensive experiments on the PhotoTourism and Tanks and Temples datasets demonstrate that SparseGS-W achieves state-of-the-art performance not only in full-reference metrics, but also in commonly used non-reference metrics such as FID, ClipIQA, and MUSIQ.</p></details> |  |

Consequently, copyright protection via watermarking has become critical. However, because 3DGS relies on millions of Gaussians, which require gigabytes of storage, efficient transfer and storage require compression. Existing 3DGS watermarking methods are vulnerable to quantization-based compression, often resulting in the loss of the embedded watermark. To address this challenge, we propose a novel watermarking method that ensures watermark robustness after model compression while maintaining high rendering quality. In detail, we incorporate a quantization distortion layer that simulates compression during training, preserving the watermark under quantization-based compression. Also, we propose a learnable watermark embedding feature that embeds the watermark into the anchor feature, ensuring structural consistency and seamless integration into the 3D scene. Furthermore, we present a frequency-aware anchor growing mechanism to enhance image quality in high-frequency regions by effectively identifying Guassians within these regions. Experimental results confirm that our method preserves the watermark and maintains superior image quality under high compression, validating it as a promising approach for a secure 3DGS model.</p></details> | 23 pages, 17 figures |

These settings are inherently ill-posed due to the lack of ground-truth data, learned geometric information, and the need to achieve accurate 3D reconstruction without finetuning, making it difficult for conventional methods to achieve high-quality results. Our model addresses these challenges by effectively integrating explicit 3D representations with self-supervised depth and pose estimation techniques, resulting in reciprocal improvements in both pose accuracy and 3D reconstruction quality.

Compared to frame-based camera, a novel type of bio-inspired visual sensor, i.e. event camera, has demonstrated advantages in high temporal resolution, high dynamic range, low power consumption and low latency. Due to its unique asynchronous and irregular data capturing process, limited work has been proposed to apply neural representation or 3D Gaussian splatting for an event camera. In this work, we present IncEventGS, an incremental 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction algorithm with a single event camera. To recover the 3D scene representation incrementally, we exploit the tracking and mapping paradigm of conventional SLAM pipelines for IncEventGS. Given the incoming event stream, the tracker firstly estimates an initial camera motion based on prior reconstructed 3D-GS scene representation. The mapper then jointly refines both the 3D scene representation and camera motion based on the previously estimated motion trajectory from the tracker. The experimental results demonstrate that IncEventGS delivers superior performance compared to prior NeRF-based methods and other related baselines, even we do not have the ground-truth camera poses. Furthermore, our method can also deliver better performance compared to state-of-the-art event visual odometry methods in terms of camera motion estimation.

We found that, despite its ultimate simplicity, using homogeneous coordinates, a concept on the projective geometry, for the 3DGS pipeline remarkably improves the rendering accuracies of distant objects. We therefore propose Homogeneous Gaussian Splatting (HoGS) incorporating homogeneous coordinates into the 3DGS framework, providing a unified representation for enhancing near and distant objects. HoGS effectively manages both expansive spatial positions and scales particularly in outdoor unbounded environments by adopting projective geometry principles.

The recent development of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offers a promising approach for real-time dense 3D reconstruction. However, existing 3DGS-based SLAM systems struggle to balance hardware simplicity, speed, and map quality. Most systems excel in one or two of the aforementioned aspects but rarely achieve all. A key issue is the difficulty of initializing 3D Gaussians while concurrently conducting SLAM. To address these challenges, we present Monocular GSO (MGSO), a novel real-time SLAM system that integrates photometric SLAM with 3DGS. Photometric SLAM provides dense structured point clouds for 3DGS initialization, accelerating optimization and producing more efficient maps with fewer Gaussians.

Second, we introduce a novel pruning technique and integrate it into the training pipeline, significantly reducing model size and training time while further raising rendering speed.

This modification enables trivial support of distorted cameras with time dependent effects such as rolling shutter, while retaining the efficiency of rasterization.

However, complex scenes can consist of millions of Gaussians, resulting in high storage and memory requirements that limit the viability of 3D-GS on devices with limited resources. Current techniques for compressing these pretrained models by pruning Gaussians rely on combining heuristics to determine which Gaussians to remove. At high compression ratios, these pruned scenes suffer from heavy degradation of visual fidelity and loss of foreground details. In this paper, we propose a principled sensitivity pruning score that preserves visual fidelity and foreground details at significantly higher compression ratios than existing approaches. It is computed as a second-order approximation of the reconstruction error on the training views with respect to the spatial parameters of each Gaussian. Additionally, we propose a multi-round prune-refine pipeline that can be applied to any pretrained 3D-GS model without changing its training pipeline. After pruning 90% of Gaussians, a substantially higher percentage than previous methods, our PUP 3D-GS pipeline increases average rendering speed by 3.56$\times$ while retaining more salient foreground information and achieving higher image quality metrics than existing techniques on scenes from the Mip-NeRF 360, Tanks & Temples, and Deep Blending datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025, Project Page: https://pup3dgs.github.io/</p></details> |

However, these methods struggle in few-shot scenarios due to limited supervision. In this paper, we present NexusGS, a 3DGS-based approach that enhances novel view synthesis from sparse-view images by directly embedding depth information into point clouds, without relying on complex manual regularizations. Exploiting the inherent epipolar geometry of 3DGS, our method introduces a novel point cloud densification strategy that initializes 3DGS with a dense point cloud, reducing randomness in point placement while preventing over-smoothing and overfitting. Specifically, NexusGS comprises three key steps: Epipolar Depth Nexus, Flow-Resilient Depth Blending, and Flow-Filtered Depth Pruning. These steps leverage optical flow and camera poses to compute accurate depth maps, while mitigating the inaccuracies often associated with optical flow. By incorporating epipolar depth priors, NexusGS ensures reliable dense point cloud coverage and supports stable 3DGS training under sparse-view conditions. Experiments demonstrate that NexusGS significantly enhances depth accuracy and rendering quality, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by a considerable margin.

| **[Mani-GS: Gaussian Splatting Manipulation with Triangular Mesh](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17811v2)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural 3D representations such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), excel at producing photo-realistic rendering results but lack the flexibility for manipulation and editing which is crucial for content creation. Previous works have attempted to address this issue by deforming a NeRF in canonical space or manipulating the radiance field based on an explicit mesh. However, manipulating NeRF is not highly controllable and requires a long training and inference time. With the emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), extremely high-fidelity novel view synthesis can be achieved using an explicit point-based 3D representation with much faster training and rendering speed. However, there is still a lack of effective means to manipulate 3DGS freely while maintaining rendering quality. In this work, we aim to tackle the challenge of achieving manipulable photo-realistic rendering. We propose to utilize a triangular mesh to manipulate 3DGS directly with self-adaptation. This approach reduces the need to design various algorithms for different types of Gaussian manipulation. By utilizing a triangle shape-aware Gaussian binding and adapting method, we can achieve 3DGS manipulation and preserve high-fidelity rendering after manipulation. Our approach is capable of handling large deformations, local manipulations, and soft body simulations while keeping high-quality rendering. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method is also effective with inaccurate meshes extracted from 3DGS. Experiments conducted demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and its superiority over baseline approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

| **[GS-Marker: Generalizable and Robust Watermarking for 3D Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18718v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the Generative AI era, safeguarding 3D models has become increasingly urgent. While invisible watermarking is well-established for 2D images with encoder-decoder frameworks, generalizable and robust solutions for 3D remain elusive. The main difficulty arises from the renderer between the 3D encoder and 2D decoder, which disrupts direct gradient flow and complicates training. Existing 3D methods typically rely on per-scene iterative optimization, resulting in time inefficiency and limited generalization. In this work, we propose a single-pass watermarking approach for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), a well-known yet underexplored representation for watermarking. We identify two major challenges: (1) ensuring effective training generalized across diverse 3D models, and (2) reliably extracting watermarks from free-view renderings, even under distortions. Our framework, named GS-Marker, incorporates a 3D encoder to embed messages, distortion layers to enhance resilience against various distortions, and a 2D decoder to extract watermarks from renderings. A key innovation is the Adaptive Marker Control mechanism that adaptively perturbs the initially optimized 3DGS, escaping local minima and improving both training stability and convergence. Extensive experiments show that GS-Marker outperforms per-scene training approaches in terms of decoding accuracy and model fidelity, while also significantly reducing computation time.</p></details> |  |

Our work contains a mathematically rigorous and geometrically intuitive derivation about how to efficiently estimate all relevant quantities for rendering RayGS models, structured with respect to standard hardware rasterization shaders. Our solution is the first enabling rendering RayGS models at sufficiently high frame rates to support quality-sensitive applications like Virtual and Mixed Reality. Our second contribution enables alias-free rendering for RayGS, by addressing MIP-related issues arising when rendering diverging scales during training and testing. We demonstrate significant performance gains, across different benchmark scenes, while retaining state-of-the-art appearance quality of RayGS.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLGS: Unsupervised Gaussian Splatting for Image Enhancement and Reconstruction in Pure Dark Environment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18640v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting has shown remarkable capabilities in novel view rendering tasks and exhibits significant potential for multi-view optimization.However, the original 3D Gaussian Splatting lacks color representation for inputs in low-light environments. Simply using enhanced images as inputs would lead to issues with multi-view consistency, and current single-view enhancement systems rely on pre-trained data, lacking scene generalization. These problems limit the application of 3D Gaussian Splatting in low-light conditions in the field of robotics, including high-fidelity modeling and feature matching. To address these challenges, we propose an unsupervised multi-view stereoscopic system based on Gaussian Splatting, called Low-Light Gaussian Splatting (LLGS). This system aims to enhance images in low-light environments while reconstructing the scene. Our method introduces a decomposable Gaussian representation called M-Color, which separately characterizes color information for targeted enhancement. Furthermore, we propose an unsupervised optimization method with zero-knowledge priors, using direction-based enhancement to ensure multi-view consistency. Experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate that our system outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both low-light enhancement and 3D Gaussian Splatting.</p></details> |  |

However, the vast number of Gaussians and their associated attributes poses significant challenges for storage and transmission. Existing methods typically handle dynamic 3DGS representation and compression separately, neglecting motion information and the rate-distortion (RD) trade-off during training, leading to performance degradation and increased model redundancy. To address this gap, we propose 4DGC, a novel rate-aware 4D Gaussian compression framework that significantly reduces storage size while maintaining superior RD performance for FVV. Specifically, 4DGC introduces a motion-aware dynamic Gaussian representation that utilizes a compact motion grid combined with sparse compensated Gaussians to exploit inter-frame similarities. This representation effectively handles large motions, preserving quality and reducing temporal redundancy. Furthermore, we present an end-to-end compression scheme that employs differentiable quantization and a tiny implicit entropy model to compress the motion grid and compensated Gaussians efficiently. The entire framework is jointly optimized using a rate-distortion trade-off. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 4DGC supports variable bitrates and consistently outperforms existing methods in RD performance across multiple datasets.</p></details> | CVPR2025 |

Despite delivering remarkable rendering quality and speed, existing methods struggle with storage demands and representing complex real-world motions. To tackle these issues, we propose MoDecGS, a memory-efficient Gaussian splatting framework designed for reconstructing novel views in challenging scenarios with complex motions. We introduce GlobaltoLocal Motion Decomposition (GLMD) to effectively capture dynamic motions in a coarsetofine manner. This approach leverages Global Canonical Scaffolds (Global CS) and Local Canonical Scaffolds (Local CS), extending static Scaffold representation to dynamic video reconstruction. For Global CS, we propose Global Anchor Deformation (GAD) to efficiently represent global dynamics along complex motions, by directly deforming the implicit Scaffold attributes which are anchor position, offset, and local context features. Next, we finely adjust local motions via the Local Gaussian Deformation (LGD) of Local CS explicitly. Additionally, we introduce Temporal Interval Adjustment (TIA) to automatically control the temporal coverage of each Local CS during training, allowing MoDecGS to find optimal interval assignments based on the specified number of temporal segments. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that MoDecGS achieves an average 70% reduction in model size over stateoftheart methods for dynamic 3D Gaussians from realworld dynamic videos while maintaining or even improving rendering quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR2...</summary><p>CVPR2025 (camera ready ver.).

While recent advances leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for high-fidelity and real-time rendering, existing methods are often specialized and task-focused, lacking a unified framework for both generation and editing. In this paper, we introduce SplatFlow, a comprehensive framework that addresses this gap by enabling direct 3DGS generation and editing. SplatFlow comprises two main components: a multi-view rectified flow (RF) model and a Gaussian Splatting Decoder (GSDecoder). The multi-view RF model operates in latent space, generating multi-view images, depths, and camera poses simultaneously, conditioned on text prompts, thus addressing challenges like diverse scene scales and complex camera trajectories in real-world settings. Then, the GSDecoder efficiently translates these latent outputs into 3DGS representations through a feed-forward 3DGS method. Leveraging training-free inversion and inpainting techniques, SplatFlow enables seamless 3DGS editing and supports a broad range of 3D tasks-including object editing, novel view synthesis, and camera pose estimation-within a unified framework without requiring additional complex pipelines. We validate SplatFlow's capabilities on the MVImgNet and DL3DV-7K datasets, demonstrating its versatility and effectiveness in various 3D generation, editing, and inpainting-based tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://gohyojun15.github.io/SplatFlow/</p></details> |

Nevertheless, developing an effective channel modeling approach has been a long-standing challenge. This issue has been escalated due to denser network deployment, larger antenna arrays, and broader bandwidth in next-generation networks. To address this challenge, we put forth WRF-GS, a novel framework for channel modeling based on wireless radiation field (WRF) reconstruction using 3D Gaussian splatting (3D-GS). WRF-GS employs 3D Gaussian primitives and neural networks to capture the interactions between the environment and radio signals, enabling efficient WRF reconstruction and visualization of the propagation characteristics. The reconstructed WRF can then be used to synthesize the spatial spectrum for comprehensive wireless channel characterization. While WRF-GS demonstrates remarkable effectiveness, it faces limitations in capturing high-frequency signal variations caused by complex multipath effects. To overcome these limitations, we propose WRF-GS+, an enhanced framework that integrates electromagnetic wave physics into the neural network design. WRF-GS+ leverages deformable 3D Gaussians to model both static and dynamic components of the WRF, significantly improving its ability to characterize signal variations. In addition, WRF-GS+ enhances the splatting process by simplifying the 3D-GS modeling process and improving computational efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that both WRF-GS and WRF-GS+ outperform baselines for spatial spectrum synthesis, including ray tracing and other deep-learning approaches. Notably, WRF-GS+ achieves state-of-the-art performance in the received signal strength indication (RSSI) and channel state information (CSI) prediction tasks, surpassing existing methods by more than 0.7 dB and 3.36 dB, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an extended journal version of our previous conference paper that was accepted to the IEEE INFOCOM 2025 at arXiv:2412.04832v2.

Through rapid, differentiable rasterization of 3D Gaussians, many 3DGS SLAM methods achieve near real-time rendering and accelerated training. However, these methods largely overlook inertial data, witch is a critical piece of information collected from the inertial measurement unit (IMU). In this paper, we present GI-SLAM, a novel gaussian-inertial SLAM system which consists of an IMU-enhanced camera tracking module and a realistic 3D Gaussian-based scene representation for mapping. Our method introduces an IMU loss that seamlessly integrates into the deep learning framework underpinning 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM, effectively enhancing the accuracy, robustness and efficiency of camera tracking. Moreover, our SLAM system supports a wide range of sensor configurations, including monocular, stereo, and RGBD cameras, both with and without IMU integration. Our method achieves competitive performance compared with existing state-of-the-art real-time methods on the EuRoC and TUM-RGBD datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 2 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Developing an effective and efficient algorithm that is capable of automatically generating high-quality PBR materials rather than RGB texture for 3D meshes can significantly streamline the 3D content creation. Most existing methods leverage pre-trained 2D diffusion models for multi-view image synthesis, which often leads to severe inconsistency between the generated textures and input 3D meshes. This paper presents TexGaussian, a novel method that uses octant-aligned 3D Gaussian Splatting for rapid PBR material generation. Specifically, we place each 3D Gaussian on the finest leaf node of the octree built from the input 3D mesh to render the multi-view images not only for the albedo map but also for roughness and metallic. Moreover, our model is trained in a regression manner instead of diffusion denoising, capable of generating the PBR material for a 3D mesh in a single feed-forward process. Extensive experiments on publicly available benchmarks demonstrate that our method synthesizes more visually pleasing PBR materials and runs faster than previous methods in both unconditional and text-conditional scenarios, exhibiting better consistency with the given geometry.

However, collecting large-scale real-world data is expensive and time-consuming, making high-fidelity synthetic data essential for enhancing data diversity and model robustness. Existing driving simulators for synthetic data generation have significant limitations: game-engine-based simulators struggle to produce realistic sensor data, while NeRF-based and diffusion-based methods face efficiency challenges. Additionally, recent simulators designed for closed-loop evaluation provide limited interaction with other vehicles, failing to simulate complex real-world traffic dynamics. To address these issues, we introduce SceneCrafter, a realistic, interactive, and efficient AD simulator based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). SceneCrafter not only efficiently generates realistic driving logs across diverse traffic scenarios but also enables robust closed-loop evaluation of end-to-end models. Experimental results demonstrate that SceneCrafter serves as both a reliable evaluation platform and a efficient data generator that significantly improves end-to-end model generalization.</p></details> |  |

However, previous methods cannot distinguish 3D instance-level information, which usually predicts a heatmap between the scene feature and text query. In this paper, we propose PanoGS, a novel and effective 3D panoptic open vocabulary scene understanding approach. Technically, to learn accurate 3D language features that can scale to large indoor scenarios, we adopt the pyramid tri-plane to model the latent continuous parametric feature space and use a 3D feature decoder to regress the multi-view fused 2D feature cloud. Besides, we propose language-guided graph cuts that synergistically leverage reconstructed geometry and learned language cues to group 3D Gaussian primitives into a set of super-primitives. To obtain 3D consistent instance, we perform graph clustering based segmentation with SAM-guided edge affinity computation between different super-primitives. Extensive experiments on widely used datasets show better or more competitive performance on 3D panoptic open vocabulary scene understanding.

With recent advancements in differentiable rendering techniques, several methods have attempted to simultaneously optimize scene representations (NeRF or 3DGS) and camera poses. Despite recent progress, existing methods relying on traditional camera input tend to fail in high-speed (or equivalently low-frame-rate) scenarios. Event cameras, inspired by biological vision, record pixel-wise intensity changes asynchronously with high temporal resolution, providing valuable scene and motion information in blind inter-frame intervals. In this paper, we introduce the event camera to aid scene construction from a casually captured video for the first time, and propose Event-Aided Free-Trajectory 3DGS, called EF-3DGS, which seamlessly integrates the advantages of event cameras into 3DGS through three key components. First, we leverage the Event Generation Model (EGM) to fuse events and frames, supervising the rendered views observed by the event stream. Second, we adopt the Contrast Maximization (CMax) framework in a piece-wise manner to extract motion information by maximizing the contrast of the Image of Warped Events (IWE), thereby calibrating the estimated poses. Besides, based on the Linear Event Generation Model (LEGM), the brightness information encoded in the IWE is also utilized to constrain the 3DGS in the gradient domain. Third, to mitigate the absence of color information of events, we introduce photometric bundle adjustment (PBA) to ensure view consistency across events and frames. We evaluate our method on the public Tanks and Temples benchmark and a newly collected real-world dataset, RealEv-DAVIS.

Currently, all existing methods rely on 2D or textual modalities during training, or together at inference. This highlights a clear absence of a model capable of processing 3D data alone for learning semantics end-to-end, along with the necessary data to train such a model. Meanwhile, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as the de facto standard for 3D scene representation across various vision tasks. However, effectively integrating semantic reasoning into 3DGS in a generalizable fashion remains an open challenge. To address these limitations we introduce SceneSplat, to our knowledge the first large-scale 3D indoor scene understanding approach that operates natively on 3DGS. Furthermore, we propose a self-supervised learning scheme that unlocks rich 3D feature learning from unlabeled scenes. In order to power the proposed methods, we introduce SceneSplat-7K, the first large-scale 3DGS dataset for indoor scenes, comprising of 6868 scenes derived from 7 established datasets like ScanNet, Matterport3D, etc. Generating SceneSplat-7K required computational resources equivalent to 119 GPU-days on an L4 GPU, enabling standardized benchmarking for 3DGS-based reasoning for indoor scenes.

The 3D Gaussian Splatting technique, alongside its derivatives, integrates the advantages of primitive-based and volumetric representations to deliver top-tier rendering quality and efficiency. Despite these advancements, the method tends to generate excessive redundant noisy Gaussians overfitted to every training view, which degrades the rendering quality. Additionally, while 3D Gaussian Splatting excels in small-scale and object-centric scenes, its application to larger scenes is hindered by constraints such as limited video memory, excessive optimization duration, and variable appearance across views. To address these challenges, we introduce GaussianFocus, an innovative approach that incorporates a patch attention algorithm to refine rendering quality and implements a Gaussian constraints strategy to minimize redundancy. Moreover, we propose a subdivision reconstruction strategy for large-scale scenes, dividing them into smaller, manageable blocks for individual training. Our results indicate that GaussianFocus significantly reduces unnecessary Gaussians and enhances rendering quality, surpassing existing State-of-The-Art (SoTA) methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate the capability of our approach to effectively manage and render large scenes, such as urban environments, whilst maintaining high fidelity in the visual output.</p></details> |  |
| **[LAYOUTDREAMER: Physics-guided Layout for Text-to-3D Compositional Scene Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01949v2)** | 2025-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, the field of text-guided 3D scene generation has garnered significant attention. High-quality generation that aligns with physical realism and high controllability is crucial for practical 3D scene applications. However, existing methods face fundamental limitations: (i) difficulty capturing complex relationships between multiple objects described in the text, (ii) inability to generate physically plausible scene layouts, and (iii) lack of controllability and extensibility in compositional scenes. In this paper, we introduce LayoutDreamer, a framework that leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to facilitate high-quality, physically consistent compositional scene generation guided by text. Specifically, given a text prompt, we convert it into a directed scene graph and adaptively adjust the density and layout of the initial compositional 3D Gaussians. Subsequently, dynamic camera adjustments are made based on the training focal point to ensure entity-level generation quality. Finally, by extracting directed dependencies from the scene graph, we tailor physical and layout energy to ensure both realism and flexibility. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that LayoutDreamer outperforms other compositional scene generation quality and semantic alignment methods. Specifically, it achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in the multiple objects generation metric of T3Bench.</p></details> |  |

However, 3DGS-based methods in robotics primarily focus on static scenes, with limited attention to the dynamic scene changes essential for long-term service robots. These robots demand sustained task execution and efficient scene updates-challenges current approaches fail to meet. To address these limitations, we propose GS-LTS (Gaussian Splatting for Long-Term Service), a 3DGS-based system enabling indoor robots to manage diverse tasks in dynamic environments over time. GS-LTS detects scene changes (e.g., object addition or removal) via single-image change detection, employs a rule-based policy to autonomously collect multi-view observations, and efficiently updates the scene representation through Gaussian editing. Additionally, we propose a simulation-based benchmark that automatically generates scene change data as compact configuration scripts, providing a standardized, user-friendly evaluation benchmark. Experimental results demonstrate GS-LTS's advantages in reconstruction, navigation, and superior scene updates-faster and higher quality than the image training baseline-advancing 3DGS for long-term robotic operations.

With the growing interest of interactive applications that need immediate feedback, online 3DGS reconstruction in real-time is in high demand. However, none of existing methods yet meet the demand due to three main challenges: the absence of predetermined camera parameters, the need for generalizable 3DGS optimization, and the necessity of reducing redundancy. We propose StreamGS, an online generalizable 3DGS reconstruction method for unposed image streams, which progressively transform image streams to 3D Gaussian streams by predicting and aggregating per-frame Gaussians. Our method overcomes the limitation of the initial point reconstruction \cite{dust3r} in tackling out-of-domain (OOD) issues by introducing a content adaptive refinement. The refinement enhances cross-frame consistency by establishing reliable pixel correspondences between adjacent frames. Such correspondences further aid in merging redundant Gaussians through cross-frame feature aggregation. The density of Gaussians is thereby reduced, empowering online reconstruction by significantly lowering computational and memory costs. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets have demonstrated that StreamGS achieves quality on par with optimization-based approaches but does so 150 times faster, and exhibits superior generalizability in handling OOD scenes.</p></details> | 8 pages |

Measuring semantic residuals of objects removed from 3D Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17574v1)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Searching in and editing 3D scenes has become extremely intuitive with trainable scene representations that allow linking human concepts to elements in the scene. These operations are often evaluated on the basis of how accurately the searched element is segmented or extracted from the scene. In this paper, we address the inverse problem, that is, how much of the searched element remains in the scene after it is removed. This question is particularly important in the context of privacy-preserving mapping when a user reconstructs a 3D scene and wants to remove private elements before sharing the map. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to address this question. To answer this, we propose a quantitative evaluation that measures whether a removal operation leaves object residuals that can be reasoned over. The scene is not private when such residuals are present. Experiments on state-of-the-art scene representations show that the proposed metrics are meaningful and consistent with the user study that we also present. We also propose a method to refine the removal based on spatial and semantic consistency.</p></details> |  |

However, it typically requires large storage capacity and high VRAM, demanding the design of effective pruning and compression techniques. Existing methods, while effective in some scenarios, struggle with scalability and fail to adapt models based on critical factors such as computing capabilities or bandwidth, requiring to re-train the model under different configurations. In this work, we propose a novel, model-agnostic technique that organizes Gaussians into several hierarchical layers, enabling progressive Level of Detail (LoD) strategy. This method, combined with recent approach of compression of 3DGS, allows a single model to instantly scale across several compression ratios, with minimal to none impact to quality compared to a single non-scalable model and without requiring re-training. We validate our approach on typical datasets and benchmarks, showcasing low distortion and substantial gains in terms of scalability and adaptability.</p></details> |  |

However, they only process a pair of views at a time to infer pixel-aligned pointmaps. When dealing with more than two views, a combinatorial number of error prone pairwise reconstructions are usually followed by an expensive global optimization, which often fails to rectify the pairwise reconstruction errors. To handle more views, reduce errors, and improve inference time, we propose the fast single-stage feed-forward network MV-DUSt3R. At its core are multi-view decoder blocks which exchange information across any number of views while considering one reference view. To make our method robust to reference view selection, we further propose MV-DUSt3R+, which employs cross-reference-view blocks to fuse information across different reference view choices. To further enable novel view synthesis, we extend both by adding and jointly training Gaussian splatting heads. Experiments on multi-view stereo reconstruction, multi-view pose estimation, and novel view synthesis confirm that our methods improve significantly upon prior art. Code will be released.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we investigate the theoretical performance of the stochastic MV-PURE estimator under varying levels of additive noise. We prove that the mean-square-error (MSE) of this estimator in the low signal-to-noise (SNR) region is much smaller than that obtained with its full-rank version, the minimum-variance distortionless estimator, and the gap becomes larger as the noise level increases. These results shed light on the excellent performance of the stochastic MV-PURE estimator in highly noisy settings obtained in simulations so far. Furthermore, we extend previous numerical simulations to show how the insight gained from the results of this paper can be used in practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>Journ...</summary><p>Journal of the Franklin Institute, 2014</p></details> |

Generalizable and MVS-based NeRFs, although capable of mitigating training time, often incur tradeoffs in quality. This paper presents a novel approach called BoostMVSNeRFs to enhance the rendering quality of MVS-based NeRFs in large-scale scenes. We first identify limitations in MVS-based NeRF methods, such as restricted viewport coverage and artifacts due to limited input views. Then, we address these limitations by proposing a new method that selects and combines multiple cost volumes during volume rendering. Our method does not require training and can adapt to any MVS-based NeRF methods in a feed-forward fashion to improve rendering quality. Furthermore, our approach is also end-to-end trainable, allowing fine-tuning on specific scenes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through experiments on large-scale datasets, showing significant rendering quality improvements in large-scale scenes and unbounded outdoor scenarios. We release the source code of BoostMVSNeRFs at https://su-terry.github.io/BoostMVSNeRFs/.</p></details> | <details><summary>SIGGR...</summary><p>SIGGRAPH 2024 Conference Papers.

The proposed IBL has two impedance booting loops for compensating leakage current due to parasitic capacitance from the ESD pad and external interconnections, and the chopper. By shifting the compensation node from the feedback pathway to the amplifier's inputs, this work realizes a higher-resolution compensation, boosting the input impedance of the AFE to several tens of G{\Omega}. The proposed DSL consists of a coarse DSL driven by DC supply voltages and a fine DSL driven by five phase-interleaving pulse-width modulated waveforms (PI-PWM). Avoiding the usage of delta-sigma CDAC, the energy efficiency is better than conventional DSLs. Designed in a 0.18-{\mu}m CMOS process, the AFE consumes 4.5 {\mu}A from a 1.2-V supply. The simulated input referred noise is 0.27 {\mu}Vrms from 0.5 to 100 Hz in the presence of a 384-mV EDO. With a 10-pF parasitic capacitance, the proposed AFE achieves an input impedance of more than 74.5 G{\Omega} at 1 Hz and 6.4 G{\Omega} at 50 Hz. The simulation results have been robust under 100 Monte-Carlo samples.</p></details> |  |

In clinical practice, however, radiologists concurrently examine all views within a mammography exam, leveraging the inherent correlations in these views to effectively detect tumors. Acknowledging the significance of multi-view analysis, some studies have introduced methods that independently process mammogram views, either through distinct convolutional branches or simple fusion strategies, inadvertently leading to a loss of crucial inter-view correlations. In this paper, we propose an innovative multi-view network exclusively based on transformers to address challenges in mammographic image classification. Our approach introduces a novel shifted window-based dynamic attention block, facilitating the effective integration of multi-view information and promoting the coherent transfer of this information between views at the spatial feature map level. Furthermore, we conduct a comprehensive comparative analysis of the performance and effectiveness of transformer-based models under diverse settings, employing the CBIS-DDSM and Vin-Dr Mammo datasets.

We propose depth discontinuity learning for MVS methods, which further improves accuracy while retaining the completeness of the reconstruction. Our idea is to jointly estimate the depth and boundary maps where the boundary maps are explicitly used for further refinement of the depth maps. We validate our idea and demonstrate that our strategies can be easily integrated into the existing learning-based MVS pipeline where the reconstruction depends on high-quality depth map estimation. Extensive experiments on various datasets show that our method improves reconstruction quality compared to baseline. Experiments also demonstrate that the presented model and strategies have good generalization capabilities. The source code will be available soon.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep PatchMatch MVS with Learned Patch Coplanarity, Geometric Consistency and Adaptive Pixel Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07582v1)** | 2022-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work in multi-view stereo (MVS) combines learnable photometric scores and regularization with PatchMatch-based optimization to achieve robust pixelwise estimates of depth, normals, and visibility. However, non-learning based methods still outperform for large scenes with sparse views, in part due to use of geometric consistency constraints and ability to optimize over many views at high resolution. In this paper, we build on learning-based approaches to improve photometric scores by learning patch coplanarity and encourage geometric consistency by learning a scaled photometric cost that can be combined with reprojection error. We also propose an adaptive pixel sampling strategy for candidate propagation that reduces memory to enable training on larger resolution with more views and a larger encoder. These modifications lead to 6-15% gains in accuracy and completeness on the challenging ETH3D benchmark, resulting in higher F1 performance than the widely used state-of-the-art non-learning approaches ACMM and ACMP.</p></details> |  |

For multi-view camera-only 3D detection, methods based on bird-eye-view or 3D geometric representations can leverage the stereo cues from overlapped regions between adjacent views and directly perform 3D detection without hand-crafted post-processing. However, it lacks direct semantic supervision for 2D backbones, which can be complemented by pretraining simple monocular-based detectors. Our solution is a multi-view framework for 4D detection following this paradigm. It is built upon a simple monocular detector FCOS3D++, pretrained only with object annotations of Waymo, and converts multi-view features to a 3D grid space to detect 3D objects thereon. A dual-path neck for single-frame understanding and temporal stereo matching is devised to incorporate multi-frame information. Our method finally achieves 49.75% mAPL with a single model and wins 2nd place in the WOD challenge, without any LiDAR-based depth supervision during training. The code will be released at https://github.com/Tai-Wang/Depth-from-Motion.</p></details> | Technical report |
| **[3D Instance Segmentation of MVS Buildings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.09902v2)** | 2022-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel 3D instance segmentation framework for Multi-View Stereo (MVS) buildings in urban scenes. Unlike existing works focusing on semantic segmentation of urban scenes, the emphasis of this work lies in detecting and segmenting 3D building instances even if they are attached and embedded in a large and imprecise 3D surface model. Multi-view RGB images are first enhanced to RGBH images by adding a heightmap and are segmented to obtain all roof instances using a fine-tuned 2D instance segmentation neural network. Instance masks from different multi-view images are then clustered into global masks. Our mask clustering accounts for spatial occlusion and overlapping, which can eliminate segmentation ambiguities among multi-view images. Based on these global masks, 3D roof instances are segmented out by mask back-projections and extended to the entire building instances through a Markov random field optimization. A new dataset that contains instance-level annotation for both 3D urban scenes (roofs and buildings) and drone images (roofs) is provided. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first outdoor dataset dedicated to 3D instance segmentation with much more annotations of attached 3D buildings than existing datasets. Quantitative evaluations and ablation studies have shown the effectiveness of all major steps and the advantages of our multi-view framework over the orthophoto-based method.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 fi...</summary><p>14 figures, 12 figures</p></details> |

Oftentimes, some of these sources, like Machine-Learning systems, are not strictly binary but associated with some degree of (lack of) confidence in the observation. We propose MV-Datalog and MV-Datalog+- as extensions of Datalog and Datalog+-, respectively, to the fuzzy semantics of infinite-valued Lukasiewicz logic L as languages for effectively reasoning in scenarios where such uncertain observations occur. We show that the semantics of MV-Datalog exhibits similar model-theoretic properties as Datalog. In particular, we show that (fuzzy) entailment can be decided via minimal fuzzy models. We show that when they exist, such minimal fuzzy models are unique (when they exist) and can be characterised in terms of a linear optimisation problem over the output of a fixed-point procedure. On the basis of this characterisation, we propose similar many-valued semantics for rules with existential quantification in the head, extending Datalog+-. This paper is under consideration for acceptance in TPLP.</p></details> |  |
| **[FaSS-MVS -- Fast Multi-View Stereo with Surface-Aware Semi-Global Matching from UAV-borne Monocular Imagery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.00821v1)** | 2021-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With FaSS-MVS, we present an approach for fast multi-view stereo with surface-aware Semi-Global Matching that allows for rapid depth and normal map estimation from monocular aerial video data captured by UAVs. The data estimated by FaSS-MVS, in turn, facilitates online 3D mapping, meaning that a 3D map of the scene is immediately and incrementally generated while the image data is acquired or being received. FaSS-MVS is comprised of a hierarchical processing scheme in which depth and normal data, as well as corresponding confidence scores, are estimated in a coarse-to-fine manner, allowing to efficiently process large scene depths which are inherent to oblique imagery captured by low-flying UAVs. The actual depth estimation employs a plane-sweep algorithm for dense multi-image matching to produce depth hypotheses from which the actual depth map is extracted by means of a surface-aware semi-global optimization, reducing the fronto-parallel bias of SGM. Given the estimated depth map, the pixel-wise surface normal information is then computed by reprojecting the depth map into a point cloud and calculating the normal vectors within a confined local neighborhood. In a thorough quantitative and ablative study we show that the accuracies of the 3D information calculated by FaSS-MVS is close to that of state-of-the-art approaches for offline multi-view stereo, with the error not even being one magnitude higher than that of COLMAP. At the same time, however, the average run-time of FaSS-MVS to estimate a single depth and normal map is less than 14 % of that of COLMAP, allowing to perform an online and incremental processing of Full-HD imagery at 1-2 Hz.</p></details> |  |
| **[PatchMatch-RL: Deep MVS with Pixelwise Depth, Normal, and Visibility](http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.08943v1)** | 2021-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent learning-based multi-view stereo (MVS) methods show excellent performance with dense cameras and small depth ranges. However, non-learning based approaches still outperform for scenes with large depth ranges and sparser wide-baseline views, in part due to their PatchMatch optimization over pixelwise estimates of depth, normals, and visibility. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end trainable PatchMatch-based MVS approach that combines advantages of trainable costs and regularizations with pixelwise estimates. To overcome the challenge of the non-differentiable PatchMatch optimization that involves iterative sampling and hard decisions, we use reinforcement learning to minimize expected photometric cost and maximize likelihood of ground truth depth and normals. We incorporate normal estimation by using dilated patch kernels, and propose a recurrent cost regularization that applies beyond frontal plane-sweep algorithms to our pixelwise depth/normal estimates. We evaluate our method on widely used MVS benchmarks, ETH3D and Tanks and Temples (TnT), and compare to other state of the art learning based MVS models. On ETH3D, our method outperforms other recent learning-based approaches and performs comparably on advanced TnT.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2021 for oral presentation</p></details> |

However, the availability of updated and accurate LV grid model is a challenge for the distribution system operator (DSO). This paper demonstrates a methodology of efficient flexibility provision and activation through a sensitivity coefficients-based model-less LV grid and a modelled MV grid approach. The paper further illustrates the value of monitoring and control through a LV DERMS platform for efficient realisation of this flexibility provision and activation. The methodology has been tested on a real MV and LV network of a Swiss DSO. The results show that there is a reduction of cost of operation for a DSO.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 8 figures, CIRED 2021</p></details> |

The two models have 86,000 and 113,000 nodes, and are made readily available for download in the OpenDSS file format. Primary substation tap change controls and MV-LV feeders are represented as three-phase unbalanced distribution network models, capturing the coupling of voltages at the MV level. The assumptions made in constructing the models are outlined, including a preconditioning step that reduces the number of nodes by more than five times without affecting the solution. Two flexibility-based case studies are presented, with TSO-DSO and peer-peer-based smart controls considered. The demonstration of the heterogeneous nature of these systems is corroborated by the analysis of measured LV voltage data. The models are intended to aid the development of algorithms for maximising the benefits of smart devices within the context of whole energy systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[End-to-end Optimized Video Compression with MV-Residual Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12945v1)** | 2020-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present an end-to-end trainable framework for P-frame compression in this paper. A joint motion vector (MV) and residual prediction network MV-Residual is designed to extract the ensembled features of motion representations and residual information by treating the two successive frames as inputs. The prior probability of the latent representations is modeled by a hyperprior autoencoder and trained jointly with the MV-Residual network. Specially, the spatially-displaced convolution is applied for video frame prediction, in which a motion kernel for each pixel is learned to generate predicted pixel by applying the kernel at a displaced location in the source image. Finally, novel rate allocation and post-processing strategies are used to produce the final compressed bits, considering the bits constraint of the challenge. The experimental results on validation set show that the proposed optimized framework can generate the highest MS-SSIM for P-frame compression competition.</p></details> |  |
| **[Urban MV and LV Distribution Grid Topology Estimation via Group Lasso](http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01845v2)** | 2018-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing penetration of distributed energy resources poses numerous reliability issues to the urban distribution grid. The topology estimation is a critical step to ensure the robustness of distribution grid operation. However, the bus connectivity and grid topology estimation are usually hard in distribution grids. For example, it is technically challenging and costly to monitor the bus connectivity in urban grids, e.g., underground lines. It is also inappropriate to use the radial topology assumption exclusively because the grids of metropolitan cities and regions with dense loads could be with many mesh structures. To resolve these drawbacks, we propose a data-driven topology estimation method for MV and LV distribution grids by only utilizing the historical smart meter measurements. Particularly, a probabilistic graphical model is utilized to capture the statistical dependencies amongst bus voltages. We prove that the bus connectivity and grid topology estimation problems, in radial and mesh structures, can be formulated as a linear regression with a least absolute shrinkage regularization on grouped variables (\textit{group lasso}). Simulations show highly accurate results in eight MV and LV distribution networks at different sizes and 22 topology configurations using PG\&E residential smart meter data.</p></details> | 15 pages, 16 figures |
| **[Calibration of One-Class SVM for MV set estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.07535v1)** | 2015-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A general approach for anomaly detection or novelty detection consists in estimating high density regions or Minimum Volume (MV) sets. The One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) is a state-of-the-art algorithm for estimating such regions from high dimensional data. Yet it suffers from practical limitations. When applied to a limited number of samples it can lead to poor performance even when picking the best hyperparameters. Moreover the solution of OCSVM is very sensitive to the selection of hyperparameters which makes it hard to optimize in an unsupervised setting. We present a new approach to estimate MV sets using the OCSVM with a different choice of the parameter controlling the proportion of outliers. The solution function of the OCSVM is learnt on a training set and the desired probability mass is obtained by adjusting the offset on a test set to prevent overfitting. Models learnt on different train/test splits are then aggregated to reduce the variance induced by such random splits. Our approach makes it possible to tune the hyperparameters automatically and obtain nested set estimates. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms the standard OCSVM formulation while suffering less from the curse of dimensionality than kernel density estimates. Results on actual data sets are also presented.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE DSAA' 2015, Oct 2015, Paris, France</p></details> |

To enable successful robot operation in such settings, maps must be constructed so that they include semantic information, in addition to geometric information. In this paper, we address the novel problem of semantic exploration, whereby a mobile robot must autonomously explore an environment to fully map both its structure and the semantic appearance of features. We develop a method based on next-best-view exploration, where potential poses are scored based on the semantic features visible from that pose. We explore two alternative methods for sampling potential views and demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in both simulation and physical experiments. Automatic creation of high-quality semantic maps can enable robots to better understand and interact with their environments and enable future embodied AI applications to be more easily deployed.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Existing representations, such as object-centric 3D scene graphs, oversimplify spatial relationships by modeling scenes as isolated objects with restrictive textual relationships, making it difficult to address queries requiring nuanced spatial understanding. Moreover, these representations lack natural mechanisms for active exploration and memory management, hindering their application to lifelong autonomy. In this work, we propose 3D-Mem, a novel 3D scene memory framework for embodied agents. 3D-Mem employs informative multi-view images, termed Memory Snapshots, to represent the scene and capture rich visual information of explored regions. It further integrates frontier-based exploration by introducing Frontier Snapshots-glimpses of unexplored areas-enabling agents to make informed decisions by considering both known and potential new information. To support lifelong memory in active exploration settings, we present an incremental construction pipeline for 3D-Mem, as well as a memory retrieval technique for memory management. Experimental results on three benchmarks demonstrate that 3D-Mem significantly enhances agents' exploration and reasoning capabilities in 3D environments, highlighting its potential for advancing applications in embodied AI.</p></details> |  |

Using the BridgeData V2 dataset, we generate fine-tuned image captions with a pretrained BLIP-2 vision-language model and combine them with visual features through an early fusion strategy. The fused representations are processed using Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agents. Experimental results demonstrate that multimodal agents achieve a 20% improvement in task completion rates and significantly outperform visual-only and textual-only baselines after sufficient training. Compared to transformer-based and recurrent multimodal RL models, our approach achieves superior performance in cumulative reward and caption quality metrics (BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE-L). These results highlight the impact of semantically aligned language cues in enhancing agent learning efficiency and generalization. The proposed framework contributes to the advancement of multimodal reinforcement learning and embodied AI systems in dynamic, real-world environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 14 figures and 3 tables</p></details> |

Despite encouraging progress, current methods mainly focus on developing separate controllers, each specialized for a specific interaction task. This significantly hinders the ability to tackle a wide variety of challenging HSI tasks that require the integration of multiple skills, e.g., sitting down while carrying an object. To address this issue, we present TokenHSI, a single, unified transformer-based policy capable of multi-skill unification and flexible adaptation. The key insight is to model the humanoid proprioception as a separate shared token and combine it with distinct task tokens via a masking mechanism. Such a unified policy enables effective knowledge sharing across skills, thereby facilitating the multi-task training. Moreover, our policy architecture supports variable length inputs, enabling flexible adaptation of learned skills to new scenarios. By training additional task tokenizers, we can not only modify the geometries of interaction targets but also coordinate multiple skills to address complex tasks. The experiments demonstrate that our approach can significantly improve versatility, adaptability, and extensibility in various HSI tasks.

However, current multimodal retrieval tasks lack sufficient complexity and demonstrate limited practical application value. It spires us to design Instance-Driven Multimodal Image Retrieval (IDMR), a novel task that requires models to retrieve images containing the same instance as a query image while matching a text-described scenario. Unlike existing retrieval tasks focused on global image similarity or category-level matching, IDMR demands fine-grained instance-level consistency across diverse contexts. To benchmark this capability, we develop IDMR-bench using real-world object tracking and first-person video data. Addressing the scarcity of training data, we propose a cross-domain synthesis method that creates 557K training samples by cropping objects from standard detection datasets. Our Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) based retrieval model, trained on 1.2M samples, outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on both traditional benchmarks and our zero-shot IDMR-bench. Experimental results demonstrate previous models' limitations in instance-aware retrieval and highlight the potential of MLLM for advanced retrieval applications.

To address this, we propose a novel framework that bridges embodied cognition theory and agent systems by leveraging a formal characterization of image schemas, which are defined as recurring patterns of sensorimotor experience that structure human cognition. By customizing LLMs to translate natural language descriptions into formal representations based on these sensorimotor patterns, we will be able to create a neurosymbolic system that grounds the agent's understanding in fundamental conceptual structures. We argue that such an approach enhances both efficiency and interpretability while enabling more intuitive human-agent interactions through shared embodied understanding.</p></details> |  |

While MLLMs have been extensively studied for visual semantic understanding tasks, their ability to perform precise and quantitative spatial-temporal understanding in real-world applications remains largely unexamined, leading to uncertain prospects. To evaluate models' Spatial-Temporal Intelligence, we introduce STI-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' spatial-temporal understanding through challenging tasks such as estimating and predicting the appearance, pose, displacement, and motion of objects. Our benchmark encompasses a wide range of robot and vehicle operations across desktop, indoor, and outdoor scenarios. The extensive experiments reveals that the state-of-the-art MLLMs still struggle in real-world spatial-temporal understanding, especially in tasks requiring precise distance estimation and motion analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[SIGHT: Single-Image Conditioned Generation of Hand Trajectories for Hand-Object Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22869v1)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel task of generating realistic and diverse 3D hand trajectories given a single image of an object, which could be involved in a hand-object interaction scene or pictured by itself. When humans grasp an object, appropriate trajectories naturally form in our minds to use it for specific tasks. Hand-object interaction trajectory priors can greatly benefit applications in robotics, embodied AI, augmented reality and related fields. However, synthesizing realistic and appropriate hand trajectories given a single object or hand-object interaction image is a highly ambiguous task, requiring to correctly identify the object of interest and possibly even the correct interaction among many possible alternatives. To tackle this challenging problem, we propose the SIGHT-Fusion system, consisting of a curated pipeline for extracting visual features of hand-object interaction details from egocentric videos involving object manipulation, and a diffusion-based conditional motion generation model processing the extracted features. We train our method given video data with corresponding hand trajectory annotations, without supervision in the form of action labels. For the evaluation, we establish benchmarks utilizing the first-person FPHAB and HOI4D datasets, testing our method against various baselines and using multiple metrics. We also introduce task simulators for executing the generated hand trajectories and reporting task success rates as an additional metric. Experiments show that our method generates more appropriate and realistic hand trajectories than baselines and presents promising generalization capability on unseen objects. The accuracy of the generated hand trajectories is confirmed in a physics simulation setting, showcasing the authenticity of the created sequences and their applicability in downstream uses.</p></details> |  |
| **[ManipTrans: Efficient Dexterous Bimanual Manipulation Transfer via Residual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21860v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human hands play a central role in interacting, motivating increasing research in dexterous robotic manipulation. Data-driven embodied AI algorithms demand precise, large-scale, human-like manipulation sequences, which are challenging to obtain with conventional reinforcement learning or real-world teleoperation. To address this, we introduce ManipTrans, a novel two-stage method for efficiently transferring human bimanual skills to dexterous robotic hands in simulation. ManipTrans first pre-trains a generalist trajectory imitator to mimic hand motion, then fine-tunes a specific residual module under interaction constraints, enabling efficient learning and accurate execution of complex bimanual tasks. Experiments show that ManipTrans surpasses state-of-the-art methods in success rate, fidelity, and efficiency. Leveraging ManipTrans, we transfer multiple hand-object datasets to robotic hands, creating DexManipNet, a large-scale dataset featuring previously unexplored tasks like pen capping and bottle unscrewing. DexManipNet comprises 3.3K episodes of robotic manipulation and is easily extensible, facilitating further policy training for dexterous hands and enabling real-world deployments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Knowledge Graphs as World Models for Semantic Material-Aware Obstacle Handling in Autonomous Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21232v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The inability of autonomous vehicles (AVs) to infer the material properties of obstacles limits their decision-making capacity. While AVs rely on sensor systems such as cameras, LiDAR, and radar to detect obstacles, this study suggests combining sensors with a knowledge graph (KG)-based world model to improve AVs' comprehension of physical material qualities. Beyond sensor data, AVs can infer qualities such as malleability, density, and elasticity using a semantic KG that depicts the relationships between obstacles and their attributes. Using the CARLA autonomous driving simulator, we evaluated AV performance with and without KG integration. The findings demonstrate that the KG-based method improves obstacle management, which allows AVs to use material qualities to make better decisions about when to change lanes or apply emergency braking. For example, the KG-integrated AV changed lanes for hard impediments like traffic cones and successfully avoided collisions with flexible items such as plastic bags by passing over them. Compared to the control system, the KG framework demonstrated improved responsiveness to obstacles by resolving conflicting sensor data, causing emergency stops for 13.3% more cases. In addition, our method exhibits a 6.6% higher success rate in lane-changing maneuvers in experimental scenarios, particularly for larger, high-impact obstacles. While we focus particularly on autonomous driving, our work demonstrates the potential of KG-based world models to improve decision-making in embodied AI systems and scale to other domains, including robotics, healthcare, and environmental simulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Online Reasoning Video Segmentation with Just-in-Time Digital Twins](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21056v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning segmentation (RS) aims to identify and segment objects of interest based on implicit text queries. As such, RS is a catalyst for embodied AI agents, enabling them to interpret high-level commands without requiring explicit step-by-step guidance. However, current RS approaches rely heavily on the visual perception capabilities of multimodal large language models (LLMs), leading to several major limitations. First, they struggle with queries that require multiple steps of reasoning or those that involve complex spatial/temporal relationships. Second, they necessitate LLM fine-tuning, which may require frequent updates to maintain compatibility with contemporary LLMs and may increase risks of catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning. Finally, being primarily designed for static images or offline video processing, they scale poorly to online video data. To address these limitations, we propose an agent framework that disentangles perception and reasoning for online video RS without LLM fine-tuning. Our innovation is the introduction of a just-in-time digital twin concept, where -- given an implicit query -- a LLM plans the construction of a low-level scene representation from high-level video using specialist vision models. We refer to this approach to creating a digital twin as "just-in-time" because the LLM planner will anticipate the need for specific information and only request this limited subset instead of always evaluating every specialist model. The LLM then performs reasoning on this digital twin representation to identify target objects. To evaluate our approach, we introduce a new comprehensive video reasoning segmentation benchmark comprising 200 videos with 895 implicit text queries. The benchmark spans three reasoning categories (semantic, spatial, and temporal) with three different reasoning chain complexity.</p></details> |  |
| **[DINeMo: Learning Neural Mesh Models with no 3D Annotations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20220v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Category-level 3D/6D pose estimation is a crucial step towards comprehensive 3D scene understanding, which would enable a broad range of applications in robotics and embodied AI. Recent works explored neural mesh models that approach a range of 2D and 3D tasks from an analysis-by-synthesis perspective. Despite the largely enhanced robustness to partial occlusion and domain shifts, these methods depended heavily on 3D annotations for part-contrastive learning, which confines them to a narrow set of categories and hinders efficient scaling. In this work, we present DINeMo, a novel neural mesh model that is trained with no 3D annotations by leveraging pseudo-correspondence obtained from large visual foundation models. We adopt a bidirectional pseudo-correspondence generation method, which produce pseudo correspondence utilize both local appearance features and global context information. Experimental results on car datasets demonstrate that our DINeMo outperforms previous zero- and few-shot 3D pose estimation by a wide margin, narrowing the gap with fully-supervised methods by 67.3%. Our DINeMo also scales effectively and efficiently when incorporating more unlabeled images during training, which demonstrate the advantages over supervised learning methods that rely on 3D annotations.

| **[DataPlatter: Boosting Robotic Manipulation Generalization with Minimal Costly Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19516v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing adoption of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in embodied AI intensifies the demand for diverse manipulation demonstrations. However, high costs associated with data collection often result in insufficient data coverage across all scenarios, which limits the performance of the models. It is observed that the spatial reasoning phase (SRP) in large workspace dominates the failure cases. Fortunately, this data can be collected with low cost, underscoring the potential of leveraging inexpensive data to improve model performance. In this paper, we introduce the DataPlatter method, a framework that decouples training trajectories into distinct task stages and leverages abundant easily collectible SRP data to enhance VLA model's generalization. Through analysis we demonstrate that sub-task-specific training with additional SRP data with proper proportion can act as a performance catalyst for robot manipulation, maximizing the utilization of costly physical interaction phase (PIP) data. Experiments show that through introducing large proportion of cost-effective SRP trajectories into a limited set of PIP data, we can achieve a maximum improvement of 41\% on success rate in zero-shot scenes, while with the ability to transfer manipulation skill to novel targets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Body Discovery of Embodied AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19941v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the pursuit of realizing artificial general intelligence (AGI), the importance of embodied artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly apparent. Following this trend, research integrating robots with AGI has become prominent. As various kinds of embodiments have been designed, adaptability to diverse embodiments will become important to AGI. We introduce a new challenge, termed "Body Discovery of Embodied AI", focusing on tasks of recognizing embodiments and summarizing neural signal functionality. The challenge encompasses the precise definition of an AI body and the intricate task of identifying embodiments in dynamic environments, where conventional approaches often prove inadequate. To address these challenges, we apply causal inference method and evaluate it by developing a simulator tailored for testing algorithms with virtual environments. Finally, we validate the efficacy of our algorithms through empirical testing, demonstrating their robust performance in various scenarios based on virtual environments.</p></details> |  |

In the context of AI-Generated Content (AIGC), RAG has proven invaluable by augmenting model outputs with supplementary, relevant information, thus improving their quality. Recently, the potential of RAG has extended beyond natural language processing, with emerging methods integrating retrieval-augmented strategies into the computer vision (CV) domain. These approaches aim to address the limitations of relying solely on internal model knowledge by incorporating authoritative external knowledge bases, thereby improving both the understanding and generation capabilities of vision models. This survey provides a comprehensive review of the current state of retrieval-augmented techniques in CV, focusing on two main areas: (I) visual understanding and (II) visual generation. In the realm of visual understanding, we systematically review tasks ranging from basic image recognition to complex applications such as medical report generation and multimodal question answering. For visual content generation, we examine the application of RAG in tasks related to image, video, and 3D generation. Furthermore, we explore recent advancements in RAG for embodied AI, with a particular focus on applications in planning, task execution, multimodal perception, interaction, and specialized domains. Given that the integration of retrieval-augmented techniques in CV is still in its early stages, we also highlight the key limitations of current approaches and propose future research directions to drive the development of this promising area.</p></details> | 19 pages, 10 figures |
| **[NavCoT: Boosting LLM-Based Vision-and-Language Navigation via Learning Disentangled Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07376v2)** | 2025-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN), as a crucial research problem of Embodied AI, requires an embodied agent to navigate through complex 3D environments following natural language instructions. Recent research has highlighted the promising capacity of large language models (LLMs) in VLN by improving navigational reasoning accuracy and interpretability. However, their predominant use in an offline manner usually suffers from substantial domain gap between the VLN task and the LLM training corpus. This paper introduces a novel strategy called Navigational Chain-of-Thought (NavCoT), where we fulfill parameter-efficient in-domain training to enable self-guided navigational decision, leading to a significant mitigation of the domain gap in a cost-effective manner. Specifically, at each timestep, the LLM is prompted to forecast the navigational chain-of-thought by: 1) acting as a world model to imagine the next observation according to the instruction, 2) selecting the candidate observation that best aligns with the imagination, and 3) determining the action based on the reasoning from the prior steps. Through constructing formalized labels for training, the LLM can learn to generate desired and reasonable chain-of-thought outputs for improving the action decision. Experimental results across various training settings and popular VLN benchmarks (e.g., Room-to-Room (R2R), Room-across-Room (RxR), Room-for-Room (R4R)) show the significant superiority of NavCoT over the direct action prediction variants. Through simple parameter-efficient finetuning, our NavCoT outperforms a recent GPT4-based approach with ~7% relative improvement on the R2R dataset. We believe that NavCoT will help unlock more task-adaptive and scalable LLM-based embodied agents, which are helpful for developing real-world robotics applications.

| **[Multimodal 3D Reasoning Segmentation with Complex Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13927v2)** | 2025-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent development in multimodal learning has greatly advanced the research in 3D scene understanding in various real-world tasks such as embodied AI. However, most existing work shares two typical constraints: 1) they are short of reasoning ability for interaction and interpretation of human intension and 2) they focus on scenarios with single-category objects only which leads to over-simplified textual descriptions due to the negligence of multi-object scenarios and spatial relations among objects. We bridge the research gaps by proposing a 3D reasoning segmentation task for multiple objects in scenes. The task allows producing 3D segmentation masks and detailed textual explanations as enriched by 3D spatial relations among objects. To this end, we create ReasonSeg3D, a large-scale and high-quality benchmark that integrates 3D segmentation masks and 3D spatial relations with generated question-answer pairs. In addition, we design MORE3D, a novel 3D reasoning network that works with queries of multiple objects and tailored 3D scene understanding designs. MORE3D learns detailed explanations on 3D relations and employs them to capture spatial information of objects and reason textual outputs. Extensive experiments show that MORE3D excels in reasoning and segmenting complex multi-object 3D scenes, and the created ReasonSeg3D offers a valuable platform for future exploration of 3D reasoning segmentation. The dataset and code will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[ZeroHSI: Zero-Shot 4D Human-Scene Interaction by Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18600v2)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human-scene interaction (HSI) generation is crucial for applications in embodied AI, virtual reality, and robotics. Yet, existing methods cannot synthesize interactions in unseen environments such as in-the-wild scenes or reconstructed scenes, as they rely on paired 3D scenes and captured human motion data for training, which are unavailable for unseen environments. We present ZeroHSI, a novel approach that enables zero-shot 4D human-scene interaction synthesis, eliminating the need for training on any MoCap data. Our key insight is to distill human-scene interactions from state-of-the-art video generation models, which have been trained on vast amounts of natural human movements and interactions, and use differentiable rendering to reconstruct human-scene interactions. ZeroHSI can synthesize realistic human motions in both static scenes and environments with dynamic objects, without requiring any ground-truth motion data. We evaluate ZeroHSI on a curated dataset of different types of various indoor and outdoor scenes with different interaction prompts, demonstrating its ability to generate diverse and contextually appropriate human-scene interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://awfuact.github.io/zerohsi/ The first two authors contribute equally</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Training of Generalizable Visuomotor Policies via Control-Aware Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09258v2)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Improving generalization is one key challenge in embodied AI, where obtaining large-scale datasets across diverse scenarios is costly. Traditional weak augmentations, such as cropping and flipping, are insufficient for improving a model's performance in new environments. Existing data augmentation methods often disrupt task-relevant information in images, potentially degrading performance. To overcome these challenges, we introduce EAGLE, an efficient training framework for generalizable visuomotor policies that improves upon existing methods by (1) enhancing generalization by applying augmentation only to control-related regions identified through a self-supervised control-aware mask and (2) improving training stability and efficiency by distilling knowledge from an expert to a visuomotor student policy, which is then deployed to unseen environments without further fine-tuning. Comprehensive experiments on three domains, including the DMControl Generalization Benchmark, the enhanced Robot Manipulation Distraction Benchmark, and a long-sequential drawer-opening task, validate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> |  |

To address this issue, we introduce KARMA, an innovative memory system that integrates long-term and short-term memory modules, enhancing large language models (LLMs) for planning in embodied agents through memory-augmented prompting. KARMA distinguishes between long-term and short-term memory, with long-term memory capturing comprehensive 3D scene graphs as representations of the environment, while short-term memory dynamically records changes in objects' positions and states. This dual-memory structure allows agents to retrieve relevant past scene experiences, thereby improving the accuracy and efficiency of task planning. Short-term memory employs strategies for effective and adaptive memory replacement, ensuring the retention of critical information while discarding less pertinent data. Compared to state-of-the-art embodied agents enhanced with memory, our memory-augmented embodied AI agent improves success rates by 1.3x and 2.3x in Composite Tasks and Complex Tasks within the AI2-THOR simulator, respectively, and enhances task execution efficiency by 3.4x and 62.7x. Furthermore, we demonstrate that KARMA's plug-and-play capability allows for seamless deployment on real-world robotic systems, such as mobile manipulation platforms.Through this plug-and-play memory system, KARMA significantly enhances the ability of embodied agents to generate coherent and contextually appropriate plans, making the execution of complex household tasks more efficient.

While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive language understanding and generation capabilities, their adaptation to 3D environments (3D-LLMs) remains in its early stages. A primary challenge is a lack of large-scale datasets with dense grounding between language and 3D scenes. We introduce 3D-GRAND, a pioneering large-scale dataset comprising 40,087 household scenes paired with 6.2 million densely-grounded scene-language instructions. Our results show that instruction tuning with 3D-GRAND significantly enhances grounding capabilities and reduces hallucinations in 3D-LLMs. As part of our contributions, we propose a comprehensive benchmark 3D-POPE to systematically evaluate hallucination in 3D-LLMs, enabling fair comparisons of models. Our experiments highlight a scaling effect between dataset size and 3D-LLM performance, emphasizing the importance of large-scale 3D-text datasets for embodied AI research. Our results demonstrate early signals for effective sim-to-real transfer, indicating that models trained on large synthetic data can perform well on real-world 3D scans. Through 3D-GRAND and 3D-POPE, we aim to equip the embodied AI community with resources and insights to lead to more reliable and better-grounded 3D-LLMs. Project website: https://3d-grand.github.io</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

Existing network AI solutions, while powerful, are mainly built based on the close-loop and passive learning framework, resulting in major limitations in autonomous solution finding and dynamic environmental adaptation. Agentic AI has recently been introduced as a promising solution to address the above limitations and pave the way for true generally intelligent and beneficial AI systems. The key idea is to create a networking ecosystem to support a diverse range of autonomous and embodied AI agents in fulfilling their goals. In this paper, we focus on the novel challenges and requirements of agentic AI networking. We propose AgentNet, a novel framework for supporting interaction, collaborative learning, and knowledge transfer among AI agents. We introduce a general architectural framework of AgentNet and then propose a generative foundation model (GFM)-based implementation in which multiple GFM-as-agents have been created as an interactive knowledge-base to bootstrap the development of embodied AI agents according to different task requirements and environmental features. We consider two application scenarios, digital-twin-based industrial automation and metaverse-based infotainment system, to describe how to apply AgentNet for supporting efficient task-driven collaboration and interaction among AI agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>Curre...</summary><p>Currently under revision at IEEE Communications Magazine</p></details> |

However, prior work has focused on distractor-free data, where changes between observations are primarily explained by ground-truth actions. Unfortunately, real-world videos contain action-correlated distractors that may hinder latent action learning. Using Distracting Control Suite (DCS) we empirically investigate the effect of distractors on latent action learning and demonstrate that LAPO struggle in such scenario. We propose LAOM, a simple LAPO modification that improves the quality of latent actions by 8x, as measured by linear probing. Importantly, we show that providing supervision with ground-truth actions, as few as 2.5% of the full dataset, during latent action learning improves downstream performance by 4.2x on average. Our findings suggest that integrating supervision during Latent Action Models (LAM) training is critical in the presence of distractors, challenging the conventional pipeline of first learning LAM and only then decoding from latent to ground-truth actions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

To bridge this gap, we introduce MoK-RAG, a novel multi-source RAG framework that implements a mixture of knowledge paths enhanced retrieval mechanism through functional partitioning of a large language model (LLM) corpus into distinct sections, enabling retrieval from multiple specialized knowledge paths. Applied to the generation of 3D simulated environments, our proposed MoK-RAG3D enhances this paradigm by partitioning 3D assets into distinct sections and organizing them based on a hierarchical knowledge tree structure. Different from previous methods that only use manual evaluation, we pioneered the introduction of automated evaluation methods for 3D scenes. Both automatic and human evaluations in our experiments demonstrate that MoK-RAG3D can assist Embodied AI agents in generating diverse scenes.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing works share two constraints: 1) heavy reliance on explicit instructions with little reasoning on implicit user intention; 2) negligence of inter-step route planning on robot moves. To bridge the gaps, we propose 3D activity reasoning and planning, a novel 3D task that reasons the intended activities from implicit instructions and decomposes them into steps with inter-step routes and planning under the guidance of fine-grained 3D object shapes and locations from scene segmentation. We tackle the new 3D task from two perspectives. First, we construct ReasonPlan3D, a large-scale benchmark that covers diverse 3D scenes with rich implicit instructions and detailed annotations for multi-step task planning, inter-step route planning, and fine-grained segmentation. Second, we design a novel framework that introduces progressive plan generation with contextual consistency across multiple steps, as well as a scene graph that is updated dynamically for capturing critical objects and their spatial relations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark and framework in reasoning activities from implicit human instructions, producing accurate stepwise task plans, and seamlessly integrating route planning for multi-step moves.

Given a human motion within a 3D scene, HIS-QA requires the agent to comprehend human states and behaviors, reason about its surrounding environment, and answer human-related questions within the scene. To support this new task, we present HIS-Bench, a multimodal benchmark that systematically evaluates HIS understanding across a broad spectrum, from basic perception to commonsense reasoning and planning. Our evaluation of various vision-language models on HIS-Bench reveals significant limitations in their ability to handle HIS-QA tasks. To this end, we propose HIS-GPT, the first foundation model for HIS understanding. HIS-GPT integrates 3D scene context and human motion dynamics into large language models while incorporating specialized mechanisms to capture human-scene interactions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HIS-GPT sets a new state-of-the-art on HIS-QA tasks. We hope this work inspires future research on human behavior analysis in 3D scenes, advancing embodied AI and world models.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we focus on the fine-grained behavior of fast-moving real robots and present a large-scale experimental study involving \numepisodes{} navigation episodes in a real environment with a physical robot, where we analyze the type of reasoning emerging from end-to-end training. In particular, we study the presence of realistic dynamics which the agent learned for open-loop forecasting, and their interplay with sensing. We analyze the way the agent uses latent memory to hold elements of the scene structure and information gathered during exploration. We probe the planning capabilities of the agent, and find in its memory evidence for somewhat precise plans over a limited horizon. Furthermore, we show in a post-hoc analysis that the value function learned by the agent relates to long-term planning. Put together, our experiments paint a new picture on how using tools from computer vision and sequential decision making have led to new capabilities in robotics and control.

We introduce the static to openable (S2O) task which creates interactive articulated 3D objects from static counterparts through openable part detection, motion prediction, and interior geometry completion. We formulate a unified framework to tackle this task, and curate a challenging dataset of openable 3D objects that serves as a test bed for systematic evaluation. Our experiments benchmark methods from prior work, extended and improved methods, and simple yet effective heuristics for the S2O task. We find that turning static 3D objects into interactively openable counterparts is possible but that all methods struggle to generalize to realistic settings of the task, and we highlight promising future work directions.

Many navigation approaches primarily define success by proximity to the target, often overlooking the necessity for optimal positioning that facilitates subsequent manipulation. To address this, we introduce MoMa-Kitchen, a benchmark dataset comprising over 100k samples that provide training data for models to learn optimal final navigation positions for seamless transition to manipulation. Our dataset includes affordance-grounded floor labels collected from diverse kitchen environments, in which robotic mobile manipulators of different models attempt to grasp target objects amidst clutter. Using a fully automated pipeline, we simulate diverse real-world scenarios and generate affordance labels for optimal manipulation positions. Visual data are collected from RGB-D inputs captured by a first-person view camera mounted on the robotic arm, ensuring consistency in viewpoint during data collection. We also develop a lightweight baseline model, NavAff, for navigation affordance grounding that demonstrates promising performance on the MoMa-Kitchen benchmark. Our approach enables models to learn affordance-based final positioning that accommodates different arm types and platform heights, thereby paving the way for more robust and generalizable integration of navigation and manipulation in embodied AI.

Recognizing continuous video activities poses considerable challenges due to the fast expansion of streaming video, which contains multi-scale and untrimmed activities. We introduce a novel system, CARS, to overcome these issues through adaptive video context modeling. Adaptive video context modeling refers to selectively maintaining activity-related features in temporal and spatial dimensions. CARS has two key designs. The first is an activity spatial feature extraction by eliminating irrelevant visual features while maintaining recognition accuracy. The second is an activity-aware state update introducing dynamic adaptability to better preserve the video context for multi-scale activity recognition. Our CARS runs at speeds $>$30 FPS on typical edge devices and outperforms all baselines by 1.2\% to 79.7\% in accuracy. Moreover, we explore applying CARS to a large video model as a video encoder. Experimental results show that our CARS can result in a 0.46-point enhancement (on a 5-point scale) on the in-distribution video activity dataset, and an improvement ranging from 1.19\% to 4\% on zero-shot video activity datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[6D Object Pose Tracking in Internet Videos for Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10307v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We seek to extract a temporally consistent 6D pose trajectory of a manipulated object from an Internet instructional video. This is a challenging set-up for current 6D pose estimation methods due to uncontrolled capturing conditions, subtle but dynamic object motions, and the fact that the exact mesh of the manipulated object is not known. To address these challenges, we present the following contributions. First, we develop a new method that estimates the 6D pose of any object in the input image without prior knowledge of the object itself. The method proceeds by (i) retrieving a CAD model similar to the depicted object from a large-scale model database, (ii) 6D aligning the retrieved CAD model with the input image, and (iii) grounding the absolute scale of the object with respect to the scene. Second, we extract smooth 6D object trajectories from Internet videos by carefully tracking the detected objects across video frames. The extracted object trajectories are then retargeted via trajectory optimization into the configuration space of a robotic manipulator. Third, we thoroughly evaluate and ablate our 6D pose estimation method on YCB-V and HOPE-Video datasets as well as a new dataset of instructional videos manually annotated with approximate 6D object trajectories. We demonstrate significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art RGB 6D pose estimation methods. Finally, we show that the 6D object motion estimated from Internet videos can be transferred to a 7-axis robotic manipulator both in a virtual simulator as well as in a real world set-up. We also successfully apply our method to egocentric videos taken from the EPIC-KITCHENS dataset, demonstrating potential for Embodied AI applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025.

| **[Long-horizon Embodied Planning with Implicit Logical Inference and Hallucination Mitigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15658v2)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-horizon embodied planning underpins embodied AI. To accomplish long-horizon tasks, one of the most feasible ways is to decompose abstract instructions into a sequence of actionable steps. Foundation models still face logical errors and hallucinations in long-horizon planning, unless provided with highly relevant examples to the tasks. However, providing highly relevant examples for any random task is unpractical. Therefore, we present ReLEP, a novel framework for Real-time Long-horizon Embodied Planning. ReLEP can complete a wide range of long-horizon tasks without in-context examples by learning implicit logical inference through fine-tuning. The fine-tuned large vision-language model formulates plans as sequences of skill functions. These functions are selected from a carefully designed skill library. ReLEP is also equipped with a Memory module for plan and status recall, and a Robot Configuration module for versatility across robot types. In addition, we propose a data generation pipeline to tackle dataset scarcity. When constructing the dataset, we considered the implicit logical relationships, enabling the model to learn implicit logical relationships and dispel hallucinations. Through comprehensive evaluations across various long-horizon tasks, ReLEP demonstrates high success rates and compliance to execution even on unseen tasks and outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

The high cost of commercial mobile manipulation robots significantly limits research in real-world scenes. To address this issue, we propose AhaRobot, a low-cost and fully open-source dual-arm mobile manipulation robot system with a hardware cost of only $1,000 (excluding optional computational resources), which is less than 1/15 of the cost of popular mobile robots. The AhaRobot system consists of three components: (1) a novel low-cost hardware architecture primarily composed of off-the-shelf components, (2) an optimized control solution to enhance operational precision integrating dual-motor backlash control and static friction compensation, and (3) a simple remote teleoperation method RoboPilot. We use handles to control the dual arms and pedals for whole-body movement. The teleoperation process is low-burden and easy to operate, much like piloting. RoboPilot is designed for remote data collection in embodied scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that RoboPilot significantly enhances data collection efficiency in complex manipulation tasks, achieving a 30% increase compared to methods using 3D mouse and leader-follower systems. It also excels at completing extremely long-horizon tasks in one go. Furthermore, AhaRobot can be used to learn end-to-end policies and autonomously perform complex manipulation tasks, such as pen insertion and cleaning up the floor. We aim to build an affordable yet powerful platform to promote the development of embodied tasks on real devices, advancing more robust and reliable embodied AI.

Current screen based chat-bots do not take advantage of the the full-suite of natural inputs available in XR, including inward facing sensor data, instead they over-rely on explicit voice or text prompts, sometimes paired with multi-modal data dropped as part of the query.

Our work minimizes the need for engineered explicit prompts, fostering grounded and intuitive interactions that glean user insights for the chat-bot.</p></details> |  |

The system leverages multiple RGBD cameras and a HoloLens headset for data collection, avoiding the use of expensive 3D scanners or mocap systems. We propose a semi-automatic method for annotating the shape and pose of hands and objects in the collected videos, significantly reducing the annotation time compared to manual labeling. With this system, we captured a video dataset of humans interacting with objects to perform various tasks, including simple pick-and-place actions, handovers between hands, and using objects according to their affordance, which can serve as human demonstrations for research in embodied AI and robot manipulation. Our data capture setup and annotation framework will be available for the community to use in reconstructing 3D shapes of objects and human hands and tracking their poses in videos.</p></details> |  |
| **[CogNav: Cognitive Process Modeling for Object Goal Navigation with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10439v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object goal navigation (ObjectNav) is a fundamental task in embodied AI, requiring an agent to locate a target object in previously unseen environments. This task is particularly challenging because it requires both perceptual and cognitive processes, including object recognition and decision-making. While substantial advancements in perception have been driven by the rapid development of visual foundation models, progress on the cognitive aspect remains constrained, primarily limited to either implicit learning through simulator rollouts or explicit reliance on predefined heuristic rules. Inspired by neuroscientific findings demonstrating that humans maintain and dynamically update fine-grained cognitive states during object search tasks in novel environments, we propose CogNav, a framework designed to mimic this cognitive process using large language models. Specifically, we model the cognitive process using a finite state machine comprising fine-grained cognitive states, ranging from exploration to identification. Transitions between states are determined by a large language model based on a dynamically constructed heterogeneous cognitive map, which contains spatial and semantic information about the scene being explored. Extensive evaluations on the HM3D, MP3D, and RoboTHOR benchmarks demonstrate that our cognitive process modeling significantly improves the success rate of ObjectNav at least by relative 14% over the state-of-the-arts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Investigating the Effectiveness of a Socratic Chain-of-Thoughts Reasoning Method for Task Planning in Robotics, A Case Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08174v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated unprecedented capability in reasoning with natural language. Coupled with this development is the emergence of embodied AI in robotics. Despite showing promise for verbal and written reasoning tasks, it remains unknown whether LLMs are capable of navigating complex spatial tasks with physical actions in the real world. To this end, it is of interest to investigate applying LLMs to robotics in zero-shot learning scenarios, and in the absence of fine-tuning - a feat which could significantly improve human-robot interaction, alleviate compute cost, and eliminate low-level programming tasks associated with robot tasks. To explore this question, we apply GPT-4(Omni) with a simulated Tiago robot in Webots engine for an object search task. We evaluate the effectiveness of three reasoning strategies based on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) sub-task list generation with the Socratic method (SocraCoT) (in order of increasing rigor): (1) Non-CoT/Non-SocraCoT, (2) CoT only, and (3) SocraCoT. Performance was measured in terms of the proportion of tasks successfully completed and execution time (N = 20). Our preliminary results show that when combined with chain-of-thought reasoning, the Socratic method can be used for code generation for robotic tasks that require spatial awareness. In extension of this finding, we propose EVINCE-LoC; a modified EVINCE method that could further enhance performance in highly complex and or dynamic testing scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[OpenFly: A Versatile Toolchain and Large-scale Benchmark for Aerial Vision-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18041v4)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) aims to guide agents through an environment by leveraging both language instructions and visual cues, playing a pivotal role in embodied AI. Indoor VLN has been extensively studied, whereas outdoor aerial VLN remains underexplored. The potential reason is that outdoor aerial view encompasses vast areas, making data collection more challenging, which results in a lack of benchmarks. To address this problem, we propose OpenFly, a platform comprising a versatile toolchain and large-scale benchmark for aerial VLN. Firstly, we develop a highly automated toolchain for data collection, enabling automatic point cloud acquisition, scene semantic segmentation, flight trajectory creation, and instruction generation. Secondly, based on the toolchain, we construct a large-scale aerial VLN dataset with 100k trajectories, covering diverse heights and lengths across 18 scenes. The corresponding visual data are generated using various rendering engines and advanced techniques, including Unreal Engine, GTA V, Google Earth, and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D GS). All data exhibit high visual quality. Particularly, 3D GS supports real-to-sim rendering, further enhancing the realism of the dataset. Thirdly, we propose OpenFly-Agent, a keyframe-aware VLN model, which takes language instructions, current observations, and historical keyframes as input, and outputs flight actions directly. Extensive analyses and experiments are conducted, showcasing the superiority of our OpenFly platform and OpenFly-Agent. The toolchain, dataset, and codes will be open-sourced.</p></details> |  |

Interactive systems assist humans in these tasks, enabling applications in Embodied AI, human-robot interaction, and virtual reality. However, current methods in hand-object synthesis often neglect dynamics and focus on generating static grasps. The first part of this dissertation introduces dynamic grasp synthesis, where a hand grasps and moves an object to a target pose. We approach this task using physical simulation and reinforcement learning. We then extend this to bimanual manipulation and articulated objects, requiring fine-grained coordination between hands. In the second part of this dissertation, we study human-to-robot handovers. We integrate captured human motion into simulation and introduce a student-teacher framework that adapts to human behavior and transfers from sim to real. To overcome data scarcity, we generate synthetic interactions, increasing training diversity by 100x. Our user study finds no difference between policies trained on synthetic vs. real motions.</p></details> | PhD Thesis |

However, real-world datasets often lack sufficient data for training and evaluation, and synthetic datasets, while larger, lack acoustic realism. Consequently, neither effectively meets practical needs. To address this issue, we introduce SonicSim, a synthetic toolkit based on the embodied AI simulation platform Habitat-sim, designed to generate highly customizable data for moving sound sources. SonicSim supports multi-level adjustments, including scene-level, microphone-level, and source-level adjustments, enabling the creation of more diverse synthetic data. Leveraging SonicSim, we constructed a benchmark dataset called SonicSet, utilizing LibriSpeech, Freesound Dataset 50k (FSD50K), Free Music Archive (FMA), and 90 scenes from Matterport3D to evaluate speech separation and enhancement models. Additionally, to investigate the differences between synthetic and real-world data, we selected 5 hours of raw, non-reverberant data from the SonicSet validation set and recorded a real-world speech separation dataset, providing a reference for comparing SonicSet with other synthetic datasets. For speech enhancement, we utilized the real-world dataset RealMAN to validate the acoustic gap between SonicSet and existing synthetic datasets. The results indicate that models trained on SonicSet generalize better to real-world scenarios compared to other synthetic datasets.

Building on the success of large language models and vision-language models, a new category of multimodal models -- referred to as vision-language-action models (VLAs) -- has emerged to address language-conditioned robotic tasks in embodied AI by leveraging their distinct ability to generate actions. In recent years, a myriad of VLAs have been developed, making it imperative to capture the rapidly evolving landscape through a comprehensive survey. To this end, we present the first survey on VLAs for embodied AI. This work provides a detailed taxonomy of VLAs, organized into three major lines of research. The first line focuses on individual components of VLAs. The second line is dedicated to developing control policies adept at predicting low-level actions. The third line comprises high-level task planners capable of decomposing long-horizon tasks into a sequence of subtasks, thereby guiding VLAs to follow more general user instructions. Furthermore, we provide an extensive summary of relevant resources, including datasets, simulators, and benchmarks. Finally, we discuss the challenges faced by VLAs and outline promising future directions in embodied AI.

Although recent progress in Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based agents has demonstrated promising perception and decision-making abilities through prompting, none has yet established a fully modular world model design that reduces risky and costly interactions with the environment by predicting the future state of the world. We introduce WMNav, a novel World Model-based Navigation framework powered by Vision-Language Models (VLMs). It predicts possible outcomes of decisions and builds memories to provide feedback to the policy module. To retain the predicted state of the environment, WMNav proposes the online maintained Curiosity Value Map as part of the world model memory to provide dynamic configuration for navigation policy. By decomposing according to a human-like thinking process, WMNav effectively alleviates the impact of model hallucination by making decisions based on the feedback difference between the world model plan and observation. To further boost efficiency, we implement a two-stage action proposer strategy: broad exploration followed by precise localization. Extensive evaluation on HM3D and MP3D validates WMNav surpasses existing zero-shot benchmarks in both success rate and exploration efficiency (absolute improvement: +3.2% SR and +3.2% SPL on HM3D, +13.5% SR and +1.1% SPL on MP3D).

Powered by modern AI technologies such as multimodal large language models and world models, Embodied AI (EmAI) represents a transformative frontier, offering enhanced autonomy and the ability to interact with the physical world to address these challenges. As an interdisciplinary and rapidly evolving research domain, "EmAI in healthcare" spans diverse fields such as algorithms, robotics, and biomedicine. This complexity underscores the importance of timely reviews and analyses to track advancements, address challenges, and foster cross-disciplinary collaboration. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the "brain" of EmAI for healthcare, wherein we introduce foundational AI algorithms for perception, actuation, planning, and memory, and focus on presenting the healthcare applications spanning clinical interventions, daily care & companionship, infrastructure support, and biomedical research. Despite its promise, the development of EmAI for healthcare is hindered by critical challenges such as safety concerns, gaps between simulation platforms and real-world applications, the absence of standardized benchmarks, and uneven progress across interdisciplinary domains. We discuss the technical barriers and explore ethical considerations, offering a forward-looking perspective on the future of EmAI in healthcare. A hierarchical framework of intelligent levels for EmAI systems is also introduced to guide further development. By providing systematic insights, this work aims to inspire innovation and practical applications, paving the way for a new era of intelligent, patient-centered healthcare.</p></details> | <details><summary>56 pa...</summary><p>56 pages, 11 figures, manuscript accepted by Information Fusion</p></details> |

Affordance indicates where and how to grasp an object by taking its functionality into account, serving as the foundation for effective task-oriented grasping. However, current task-oriented methods often depend on extensive training data that is confined to specific tasks and objects, making it difficult to generalize to novel objects and complex scenes. In this paper, we introduce AffordGrasp, a novel open-vocabulary grasping framework that leverages the reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) for in-context affordance reasoning. Unlike existing methods that rely on explicit task and object specifications, our approach infers tasks directly from implicit user instructions, enabling more intuitive and seamless human-robot interaction in everyday scenarios. Building on the reasoning outcomes, our framework identifies task-relevant objects and grounds their part-level affordances using a visual grounding module. This allows us to generate task-oriented grasp poses precisely within the affordance regions of the object, ensuring both functional and context-aware robotic manipulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AffordGrasp achieves state-of-the-art performance in both simulation and real-world scenarios, highlighting the effectiveness of our method. We believe our approach advances robotic manipulation techniques and contributes to the broader field of embodied AI. Project website: https://eqcy.github.io/affordgrasp/.</p></details> |  |

Our approach leverages differentiable neural rendering on multi-view images to endow a vanilla Vision Transformer (ViT) with intrinsic spatial understanding. We present the most comprehensive evaluation of embodied representation learning to date, covering 268 tasks across 8 simulators with diverse policies in both single-task and language-conditioned multi-task scenarios. The results are compelling: SPA consistently outperforms more than 10 state-of-the-art representation methods, including those specifically designed for embodied AI, vision-centric tasks, and multi-modal applications, while using less training data. Furthermore, we conduct a series of real-world experiments to confirm its effectiveness in practical scenarios. These results highlight the critical role of 3D spatial awareness for embodied representation learning. Our strongest model takes more than 6000 GPU hours to train and we are committed to open-sourcing all code and model weights to foster future research in embodied representation learning.

To this end, we present MS-HAB, a holistic benchmark for low-level manipulation and in-home object rearrangement. First, we provide a GPU-accelerated implementation of the Home Assistant Benchmark (HAB). We support realistic low-level control and achieve over 3x the speed of prior magical grasp implementations at a fraction of the GPU memory usage. Second, we train extensive reinforcement learning (RL) and imitation learning (IL) baselines for future work to compare against. Finally, we develop a rule-based trajectory filtering system to sample specific demonstrations from our RL policies which match predefined criteria for robot behavior and safety. Combining demonstration filtering with our fast environments enables efficient, controlled data generation at scale.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce a Self-Refining Data Flywheel (SRDF) that generates high-quality and large-scale navigational instruction-trajectory pairs by iteratively refining the data pool through the collaboration between two models, the instruction generator and the navigator, without any human-in-the-loop annotation. Specifically, SRDF starts with using a base generator to create an initial data pool for training a base navigator, followed by applying the trained navigator to filter the data pool. This leads to higher-fidelity data to train a better generator, which can, in turn, produce higher-quality data for training the next-round navigator. Such a flywheel establishes a data self-refining process, yielding a continuously improved and highly effective dataset for large-scale language-guided navigation learning. Our experiments demonstrate that after several flywheel rounds, the navigator elevates the performance boundary from 70% to 78% SPL on the classic R2R test set, surpassing human performance (76%) for the first time. Meanwhile, this process results in a superior generator, evidenced by a SPICE increase from 23.5 to 26.2, better than all previous VLN instruction generation methods. Finally, we demonstrate the scalability of our method through increasing environment and instruction diversity, and the generalization ability of our pre-trained navigator across various downstream navigation tasks, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin in all cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, Code and data are available at https://github.com/wz0919/VLN-SRDF</p></details> |

These vulnerabilities manifest through sensor spoofing, adversarial attacks, and failures in task and motion planning, posing significant challenges to robustness and safety. Despite the growing body of research, existing reviews rarely focus specifically on the unique safety and security challenges of embodied AI systems. Most prior work either addresses general AI vulnerabilities or focuses on isolated aspects, lacking a dedicated and unified framework tailored to embodied AI. This survey fills this critical gap by: (1) categorizing vulnerabilities specific to embodied AI into exogenous (e.g., physical attacks, cybersecurity threats) and endogenous (e.g., sensor failures, software flaws) origins; (2) systematically analyzing adversarial attack paradigms unique to embodied AI, with a focus on their impact on perception, decision-making, and embodied interaction; (3) investigating attack vectors targeting large vision-language models (LVLMs) and large language models (LLMs) within embodied systems, such as jailbreak attacks and instruction misinterpretation; (4) evaluating robustness challenges in algorithms for embodied perception, decision-making, and task planning; and (5) proposing targeted strategies to enhance the safety and reliability of embodied AI systems. By integrating these dimensions, we provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the interplay between vulnerabilities and safety in embodied AI.</p></details> |  |

However, the one-to-many nature of the image-to-3D problem limits their use due to inconsistent content and quality across views. Previous models optimize a 3D model by sampling views from a view-conditioned diffusion prior, but diffusion models cannot guarantee view consistency. Instead, we present ConsistentDreamer, where we first generate a set of fixed multi-view prior images and sample random views between them with another diffusion model through a score distillation sampling (SDS) loss. Thereby, we limit the discrepancies between the views guided by the SDS loss and ensure a consistent rough shape. In each iteration, we also use our generated multi-view prior images for fine-detail reconstruction. To balance between the rough shape and the fine-detail optimizations, we introduce dynamic task-dependent weights based on homoscedastic uncertainty, updated automatically in each iteration. Additionally, we employ opacity, depth distortion, and normal alignment losses to refine the surface for mesh extraction. Our method ensures better view consistency and visual quality compared to the state-of-the-art.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript accepted by Pattern Recognition Letters.

Traditional approaches rely heavily on historical observations as spatio-temporal contexts for decision making, leading to significant storage and computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce MapNav, a novel end-to-end VLN model that leverages Annotated Semantic Map (ASM) to replace historical frames. Specifically, our approach constructs a top-down semantic map at the start of each episode and update it at each timestep, allowing for precise object mapping and structured navigation information. Then, we enhance this map with explicit textual labels for key regions, transforming abstract semantics into clear navigation cues and generate our ASM. MapNav agent using the constructed ASM as input, and use the powerful end-to-end capabilities of VLM to empower VLN. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MapNav achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in both simulated and real-world environments, validating the effectiveness of our method. Moreover, we will release our ASM generation source code and dataset to ensure reproducibility, contributing valuable resources to the field. We believe that our proposed MapNav can be used as a new memory representation method in VLN, paving the way for future research in this field.</p></details> |  |

To advance Spatial Artificial Intelligence, we pioneer a psychometric framework defining five Basic Spatial Abilities (BSAs) in Visual Language Models (VLMs): Spatial Perception, Spatial Relation, Spatial Orientation, Mental Rotation, and Spatial Visualization. Benchmarking 13 mainstream VLMs through nine validated psychometric experiments reveals significant gaps versus humans (average score 24.95 vs. 68.38), with three key findings: 1) VLMs mirror human hierarchies (strongest in 2D orientation, weakest in 3D rotation) with independent BSAs (Pearson's r<0.4); 2) Smaller models such as Qwen2-VL-7B surpass larger counterparts, with Qwen leading (30.82) and InternVL2 lagging (19.6); 3) Interventions like chain-of-thought (0.100 accuracy gain) and 5-shot training (0.259 improvement) show limits from architectural constraints. Identified barriers include weak geometry encoding and missing dynamic simulation. By linking psychometric BSAs to VLM capabilities, we provide a diagnostic toolkit for spatial intelligence evaluation, methodological foundations for embodied AI development, and a cognitive science-informed roadmap for achieving human-like spatial intelligence.</p></details> |  |

However, when powered by open LLMs, they struggle with basic tasks even after domain-specific fine-tuning. We present MindForge, a generative-agent framework for collaborative lifelong learning through explicit perspective taking. We introduce three key innovations: (1) a structured theory of mind representation linking percepts, beliefs, desires, and actions; (2) natural interagent communication; and (3) a multicomponent memory system.

Despite successes in applying Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for high-level traffic scene semantic understanding, it remains challenging to effectively translate these conceptual semantics understandings into low-level motion control commands and achieve generalization and consensus in cross-scene driving. We introduce Sce2DriveX, a human-like driving chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning MLLM framework. Sce2DriveX utilizes multimodal joint learning from local scene videos and global BEV maps to deeply understand long-range spatiotemporal relationships and road topology, enhancing its comprehensive perception and reasoning capabilities in 3D dynamic/static scenes and achieving driving generalization across scenes. Building on this, it reconstructs the implicit cognitive chain inherent in human driving, covering scene understanding, meta-action reasoning, behavior interpretation analysis, motion planning and control, thereby further bridging the gap between autonomous driving and human thought processes. To elevate model performance, we have developed the first extensive Visual Question Answering (VQA) driving instruction dataset tailored for 3D spatial understanding and long-axis task reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Sce2DriveX achieves state-of-the-art performance from scene understanding to end-to-end driving, as well as robust generalization on the CARLA Bench2Drive benchmark.</p></details> |  |

While recent advances have enhanced the ability of VLMs to perceive object locations and positional relationships, they still lack the capability to precisely understand object orientations-a key requirement for tasks involving fine-grained manipulations. Addressing this limitation not only requires geometric reasoning but also an expressive and intuitive way to represent orientation. In this context, we propose that natural language offers a more flexible representation space than canonical frames, making it particularly suitable for instruction-following robotic systems. In this paper, we introduce the concept of semantic orientation, which defines object orientations using natural language in a reference-frame-free manner (e.g., the ''plug-in'' direction of a USB or the ''handle'' direction of a knife). To support this, we construct OrienText300K, a large-scale dataset of 3D models annotated with semantic orientations that link geometric understanding to functional semantics. By integrating semantic orientation into a VLM system, we enable robots to generate manipulation actions with both positional and orientational constraints. Extensive experiments in simulation and real world demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances robotic manipulation capabilities, e.g., 48.7% accuracy on Open6DOR and 74.9% accuracy on SIMPLER.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://qizekun.github.io/sofar/</p></details> |

Recent advances in foundation models pave the way for generative agents capable of richer communication and adaptive problem-solving. This survey provides a systematic examination of how EMAS can benefit from these generative capabilities. We propose a taxonomy that categorizes EMAS by system architectures and embodiment modalities, emphasizing how collaboration spans both physical and virtual contexts. Central building blocks, perception, planning, communication, and feedback, are then analyzed to illustrate how generative techniques bolster system robustness and flexibility. Through concrete examples, we demonstrate the transformative effects of integrating foundation models into embodied, multi-agent frameworks. Finally, we discuss challenges and future directions, underlining the significant promise of EMAS to reshape the landscape of AI-driven collaboration.</p></details> | 18 pages |

We propose a novel object-centric latent action learning approach, based on VideoSaur and LAPO, that employs self-supervised decomposition of scenes into object representations and annotates video data with proxy-action labels. This method effectively disentangles causal agent-object interactions from irrelevant background noise and reduces the performance degradation of latent action learning approaches caused by distractors. Our preliminary experiments with the Distracting Control Suite show that latent action pretraining based on object decompositions improve the quality of inferred latent actions by x2.7 and efficiency of downstream fine-tuning with a small set of labeled actions, increasing return by x2.6 on average.</p></details> | Preprint.

| **[POEX: Understanding and Mitigating Policy Executable Jailbreak Attacks against Embodied AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16633v2)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI systems are rapidly evolving due to the integration of LLMs as planning modules, which transform complex instructions into executable policies. However, LLMs are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which can generate malicious content. This paper investigates the feasibility and rationale behind applying traditional LLM jailbreak attacks to EAI systems. We aim to answer three questions: (1) Do traditional LLM jailbreak attacks apply to EAI systems? (2) What challenges arise if they do not? and (3) How can we defend against EAI jailbreak attacks? To this end, we first measure existing LLM-based EAI systems using a newly constructed dataset, i.e., the Harmful-RLbench. Our study confirms that traditional LLM jailbreak attacks are not directly applicable to EAI systems and identifies two unique challenges. First, the harmful text does not necessarily constitute harmful policies. Second, even if harmful policies can be generated, they are not necessarily executable by the EAI systems, which limits the potential risk. To facilitate a more comprehensive security analysis, we refine and introduce POEX, a novel red teaming framework that optimizes adversarial suffixes to induce harmful yet executable policies against EAI systems. The design of POEX employs adversarial constraints, policy evaluators, and suffix optimization to ensure successful policy execution while evading safety detection inside an EAI system. Experiments on the real-world robotic arm and simulator using Harmful-RLbench demonstrate the efficacy, highlighting severe safety vulnerabilities and high transferability across models. Finally, we propose prompt-based and model-based defenses, achieving an 85% success rate in mitigating attacks and enhancing safety awareness in EAI systems. Our findings underscore the urgent need for robust security measures to ensure the safe deployment of EAI in critical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Homep...</summary><p>Homepage: https://poex-eai-jailbreak.github.io/</p></details> |

These advancements have led to an explosive increase in the demand for computational power, challenging the limits of Moore's Law. Optical lithography, a critical technology in semiconductor manufacturing, faces significant challenges due to its high costs. To address this, various lithography simulators have been developed. However, many of these simulators are limited by their inadequate photoresist modeling capabilities. This paper presents TorchResist, an open-source, differentiable photoresist simulator.TorchResist employs an analytical approach to model the photoresist process, functioning as a white-box system with at most twenty interpretable parameters. Leveraging modern differentiable programming techniques and parallel computing on GPUs, TorchResist enables seamless co-optimization with other tools across multiple related tasks.

Large Language Model (LLM), which exhibits powerful language understanding abilities, has been extensively employed in embodied AI by facilitating sophisticated task planning. However, a critical safety issue remains overlooked: could these embodied LLMs perpetrate harmful behaviors? In response, we introduce BadRobot, a novel attack paradigm aiming to make embodied LLMs violate safety and ethical constraints through typical voice-based user-system interactions. Specifically, three vulnerabilities are exploited to achieve this type of attack: (i) manipulation of LLMs within robotic systems, (ii) misalignment between linguistic outputs and physical actions, and (iii) unintentional hazardous behaviors caused by world knowledge's flaws. Furthermore, we construct a benchmark of various malicious physical action queries to evaluate BadRobot's attack performance. Based on this benchmark, extensive experiments against existing prominent embodied LLM frameworks (e.g., Voxposer, Code as Policies, and ProgPrompt) demonstrate the effectiveness of our BadRobot.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025.

| **[LSceneLLM: Enhancing Large 3D Scene Understanding Using Adaptive Visual Preferences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01292v2)** | 2025-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Research on 3D Vision-Language Models (3D-VLMs) is gaining increasing attention, which is crucial for developing embodied AI within 3D scenes, such as visual navigation and embodied question answering. Due to the high density of visual features, especially in large 3D scenes, accurately locating task-relevant visual information is challenging. Existing works attempt to segment all objects and consider their features as scene representations. However, these task-agnostic object features include much redundant information and missing details for the task-relevant area. To tackle these problems, we propose LSceneLLM, an adaptive framework that automatically identifies task-relevant areas by leveraging LLM's visual preference for different tasks, followed by a plug-and-play scene magnifier module to capture fine-grained details in focused areas. Specifically, a dense token selector examines the attention map of LLM to identify visual preferences for the instruction input. It then magnifies fine-grained details of the focusing area. An adaptive self-attention module is leveraged to fuse the coarse-grained and selected fine-grained visual information. To comprehensively evaluate the large scene understanding ability of 3D-VLMs, we further introduce a cross-room understanding benchmark, XR-Scene, which contains a series of large scene understanding tasks including XR-QA, XR-EmbodiedPlanning, and XR-SceneCaption. Experiments show that our method surpasses existing methods on both large scene understanding and existing scene understanding benchmarks. Plunging our scene magnifier module into the existing 3D-VLMs also brings significant improvement.</p></details> |  |

Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) enables drones to locate objects based on natural language expressions, a crucial capability for Embodied AI. Despite advances in REC for ground-level scenes, aerial views introduce unique challenges including varying viewpoints, occlusions and scale variations. To address this gap, we introduce RefDrone, a REC benchmark for drone scenes. RefDrone reveals three key challenges in REC: 1) multi-scale and small-scale target detection; 2) multi-target and no-target samples; 3) complex environment with rich contextual expressions. To efficiently construct this dataset, we develop RDAgent (referring drone annotation framework with multi-agent system), a semi-automated annotation tool for REC tasks. RDAgent ensures high-quality contextual expressions and reduces annotation cost. Furthermore, we propose Number GroundingDINO (NGDINO), a novel method designed to handle multi-target and no-target cases. NGDINO explicitly learns and utilizes the number of objects referred to in the expression. Comprehensive experiments with state-of-the-art REC methods demonstrate that NGDINO achieves superior performance on both the proposed RefDrone and the existing gRefCOCO datasets. The dataset and code will be publicly at https://github.com/sunzc-sunny/refdrone.</p></details> |  |

We introduce MINDSTORES, an experience-augmented planning framework that enables embodied agents to build and leverage mental models through natural interaction with their environment. Drawing inspiration from how humans construct and refine cognitive mental models, our approach extends existing zero-shot LLM planning by maintaining a database of past experiences that informs future planning iterations. The key innovation is representing accumulated experiences as natural language embeddings of (state, task, plan, outcome) tuples, which can then be efficiently retrieved and reasoned over by an LLM planner to generate insights and guide plan refinement for novel states and tasks. Through extensive experiments in the MineDojo environment, a simulation environment for agents in Minecraft that provides low-level controls for Minecraft, we find that MINDSTORES learns and applies its knowledge significantly better than existing memory-based LLM planners while maintaining the flexibility and generalization benefits of zero-shot approaches, representing an important step toward more capable embodied AI systems that can learn continuously through natural experience.</p></details> |  |

This enhancement has reduced errors in mathematical and logical tasks while improving accuracy. These developments have facilitated LLMs' use as agents that can interact with tools and adapt their responses based on new information. Our study examines DeepSeek R1, a model trained to output reasoning tokens similar to OpenAI's o1. Testing revealed concerning behaviors: the model exhibited deceptive tendencies and demonstrated self-preservation instincts, including attempts of self-replication, despite these traits not being explicitly programmed (or prompted). These findings raise concerns about LLMs potentially masking their true objectives behind a facade of alignment. When integrating such LLMs into robotic systems, the risks become tangible - a physically embodied AI exhibiting deceptive behaviors and self-preservation instincts could pursue its hidden objectives through real-world actions. This highlights the critical need for robust goal specification and safety frameworks before any physical implementation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Corre...</summary><p>Corrected Version - Solved Some Issues with reference compilation by latex</p></details> |

While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown great promise in reasoning and task planning for embodied agents, their ability to comprehend physical phenomena remains extremely limited. To close this gap, we introduce PhysBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs' physical world understanding capability across a diverse set of tasks. PhysBench contains 10,002 entries of interleaved video-image-text data, categorized into four major domains: physical object properties, physical object relationships, physical scene understanding, and physics-based dynamics, further divided into 19 subclasses and 8 distinct capability dimensions. Our extensive experiments, conducted on 75 representative VLMs, reveal that while these models excel in common-sense reasoning, they struggle with understanding the physical world -- likely due to the absence of physical knowledge in their training data and the lack of embedded physical priors. To tackle the shortfall, we introduce PhysAgent, a novel framework that combines the generalization strengths of VLMs with the specialized expertise of vision models, significantly enhancing VLMs' physical understanding across a variety of tasks, including an 18.4\% improvement on GPT-4o. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that enhancing VLMs' physical world understanding capabilities can help embodied agents such as MOKA. We believe that PhysBench and PhysAgent offer valuable insights and contribute to bridging the gap between VLMs and physical world understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025.

Nevertheless, the rapid development of MEANETs is accompanied by challenges in trustworthiness and operational efficiency. Fortunately, blockchain technology, with its decentralized and immutable characteristics, offers promising solutions for MEANETs. However, existing block propagation mechanisms suffer from challenges such as low propagation efficiency and weak security for block propagation, which results in delayed transmission of vehicular messages or vulnerability to malicious tampering, potentially causing severe traffic accidents in blockchain-enabled MEANETs. Moreover, current block propagation strategies cannot effectively adapt to real-time changes of dynamic topology in MEANETs. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a graph Resfusion model-based trustworthy block propagation optimization framework for consortium blockchain-enabled MEANETs. Specifically, we propose an innovative trust calculation mechanism based on the trust cloud model, which comprehensively accounts for randomness and fuzziness in the miner trust evaluation. Furthermore, by leveraging the strengths of graph neural networks and diffusion models, we develop a graph Resfusion model to effectively and adaptively generate the optimal block propagation trajectory. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms other routing mechanisms in terms of block propagation efficiency and trustworthiness. Additionally, the results highlight its strong adaptability to dynamic environments, making it particularly suitable for rapidly changing MEANETs.</p></details> | 15 pages, 11 figures |

Efforts to enhance spatial reasoning abilities through supplementary spatial data and fine-tuning have proven limited and ineffective when addressing complex embodied tasks, largely due to their dependence on language-based outputs. While some approaches have introduced a point-based action space to mitigate this issue, they fall short in managing more intricate tasks within complex environments. This deficiency arises from their failure to fully exploit the inherent thinking and reasoning capabilities that are fundamental strengths of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach named SpatialCoT, specifically designed to bolster the spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs. Our approach comprises two stages: spatial coordinate bi-directional alignment, which aligns vision-language inputs with spatial coordinates, and chain-of-thought spatial grounding, which harnesses the reasoning capabilities of language models for advanced spatial reasoning. We evaluate SpatialCoT on challenging navigation and manipulation tasks, both in simulation and real-world settings. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches in both tasks.</p></details> | Under Review |

Existing benchmarks for evaluating MLLMs primarily utilize static images or videos, limiting assessments to non-interactive scenarios. Meanwhile, existing embodied AI benchmarks are task-specific and not diverse enough, which do not adequately evaluate the embodied capabilities of MLLMs. To address this, we propose EmbodiedEval, a comprehensive and interactive evaluation benchmark for MLLMs with embodied tasks. EmbodiedEval features 328 distinct tasks within 125 varied 3D scenes, each of which is rigorously selected and annotated. It covers a broad spectrum of existing embodied AI tasks with significantly enhanced diversity, all within a unified simulation and evaluation framework tailored for MLLMs. The tasks are organized into five categories: navigation, object interaction, social interaction, attribute question answering, and spatial question answering to assess different capabilities of the agents. We evaluated the state-of-the-art MLLMs on EmbodiedEval and found that they have a significant shortfall compared to human level on embodied tasks. Our analysis demonstrates the limitations of existing MLLMs in embodied capabilities, providing insights for their future development. We open-source all evaluation data and simulation framework at https://github.com/thunlp/EmbodiedEval.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we take a step toward this goal by introducing GenEx, a system capable of planning complex embodied world exploration, guided by its generative imagination that forms priors (expectations) about the surrounding environments. GenEx generates an entire 3D-consistent imaginative environment from as little as a single RGB image, bringing it to life through panoramic video streams. Leveraging scalable 3D world data curated from Unreal Engine, our generative model is rounded in the physical world. It captures a continuous 360-degree environment with little effort, offering a boundless landscape for AI agents to explore and interact with. GenEx achieves high-quality world generation, robust loop consistency over long trajectories, and demonstrates strong 3D capabilities such as consistency and active 3D mapping. Powered by generative imagination of the world, GPT-assisted agents are equipped to perform complex embodied tasks, including both goal-agnostic exploration and goal-driven navigation. These agents utilize predictive expectation regarding unseen parts of the physical world to refine their beliefs, simulate different outcomes based on potential decisions, and make more informed choices.

While a significant body of work has been leveraging LLMs for decision making in embodied environments, we still lack a systematic understanding of their performance because they are usually applied in different domains, for different purposes, and built based on different inputs and outputs. Furthermore, existing evaluations tend to rely solely on a final success rate, making it difficult to pinpoint what ability is missing in LLMs and where the problem lies, which in turn blocks embodied agents from leveraging LLMs effectively and selectively. To address these limitations, we propose a generalized interface (Embodied Agent Interface) that supports the formalization of various types of tasks and input-output specifications of LLM-based modules. Specifically, it allows us to unify 1) a broad set of embodied decision-making tasks involving both state and temporally extended goals, 2) four commonly-used LLM-based modules for decision making: goal interpretation, subgoal decomposition, action sequencing, and transition modeling, and 3) a collection of fine-grained metrics which break down evaluation into various types of errors, such as hallucination errors, affordance errors, various types of planning errors, etc. Overall, our benchmark offers a comprehensive assessment of LLMs' performance for different subtasks, pinpointing the strengths and weaknesses in LLM-powered embodied AI systems, and providing insights for effective and selective use of LLMs in embodied decision making.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for oral presentation at NeurIPS 2024 in the Datasets and Benchmarks track.

Agents are tasked to navigate towards a target goal by executing a set of low-level actions, following a series of natural language instructions. All VLN-CE methods in the literature assume that language instructions are exact. However, in practice, instructions given by humans can contain errors when describing a spatial environment due to inaccurate memory or confusion. Current VLN-CE benchmarks do not address this scenario, making the state-of-the-art methods in VLN-CE fragile in the presence of erroneous instructions from human users. For the first time, we propose a novel benchmark dataset that introduces various types of instruction errors considering potential human causes. This benchmark provides valuable insight into the robustness of VLN systems in continuous environments. We observe a noticeable performance drop (up to -25%) in Success Rate when evaluating the state-of-the-art VLN-CE methods on our benchmark. Moreover, we formally define the task of Instruction Error Detection and Localization, and establish an evaluation protocol on top of our benchmark dataset. We also propose an effective method, based on a cross-modal transformer architecture, that achieves the best performance in error detection and localization, compared to baselines. Surprisingly, our proposed method has revealed errors in the validation set of the two commonly used datasets for VLN-CE, i.e., R2R-CE and RxR-CE, demonstrating the utility of our technique in other tasks.

However, tasks such as object search have largely focused on efficient policy learning. In this work, we identify several gaps in current search methods: They largely focus on dated perception models, neglect temporal aggregation, and transfer from ground truth directly to noisy perception at test time, without accounting for the resulting overconfidence in the perceived state. We address the identified problems through calibrated perception probabilities and uncertainty across aggregation and found decisions, thereby adapting the models for sequential tasks. The resulting methods can be directly integrated with pretrained models across a wide family of existing search approaches at no additional training cost. We perform extensive evaluations of aggregation methods across both different semantic perception models and policies, confirming the importance of calibrated uncertainties in both the aggregation and found decisions. We make the code and trained models available at https://semantic-search.cs.uni-freiburg.de.</p></details> |  |

Among many skills that the agents need to possess, building and maintaining a semantic map of the environment is most crucial in long-horizon tasks. A semantic map captures information about the environment in a structured way, allowing the agent to reference it for advanced reasoning throughout the task. While existing surveys in embodied AI focus on general advancements or specific tasks like navigation and manipulation, this paper provides a comprehensive review of semantic map-building approaches in embodied AI, specifically for indoor navigation. We categorize these approaches based on their structural representation (spatial grids, topological graphs, dense point-clouds or hybrid maps) and the type of information they encode (implicit features or explicit environmental data). We also explore the strengths and limitations of the map building techniques, highlight current challenges, and propose future research directions. We identify that the field is moving towards developing open-vocabulary, queryable, task-agnostic map representations, while high memory demands and computational inefficiency still remaining to be open challenges. This survey aims to guide current and future researchers in advancing semantic mapping techniques for embodied AI systems.</p></details> |  |

Unlike prior studies that explored this as long-form video understanding and utilized egocentric video only, we instead propose an LLM-based agent, Embodied VideoAgent, which constructs scene memory from both egocentric video and embodied sensory inputs (e.g. depth and pose sensing). We further introduce a VLM-based approach to automatically update the memory when actions or activities over objects are perceived.

Recent works utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate enriched action step description texts to guide action step decoding. Although LLMs are introduced, these methods decode the action steps into a closed-set of one-hot vectors, limiting the model's capability of generalizing to new steps or tasks. Additionally, fixed action step descriptions based on world-level commonsense may contain noise in specific instances of visual states. In this paper, we propose PlanLLM, a cross-modal joint learning framework with LLMs for video procedure planning. We propose an LLM-Enhanced Planning module which fully uses the generalization ability of LLMs to produce free-form planning output and to enhance action step decoding. We also propose Mutual Information Maximization module to connect world-level commonsense of step descriptions and sample-specific information of visual states, enabling LLMs to employ the reasoning ability to generate step sequences. With the assistance of LLMs, our method can both closed-set and open vocabulary procedure planning tasks. Our PlanLLM achieves superior performance on three benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our designs.</p></details> | accepted to AAAI2025 |

Such models are useful for embodied AI and scene retrieval applications, which involve searching for objects or patterns using natural language descriptions. While recent works have focused on LLM-based scaling of 3DVG datasets, these datasets do not capture the full range of potential prompts which could be specified in the English language. To ensure that we are scaling up and testing against a useful and representative set of prompts, we propose a framework for linguistically analyzing 3DVG prompts and introduce Visual Grounding with Diverse Language in 3D (ViGiL3D), a diagnostic dataset for evaluating visual grounding methods against a diverse set of language patterns. We evaluate existing open-vocabulary 3DVG methods to demonstrate that these methods are not yet proficient in understanding and identifying the targets of more challenging, out-of-distribution prompts, toward real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages with 5 figures and 11 tables</p></details> |

The proposed framework aims to optimize both data transmission efficiency and decision accuracy by formulating an optimization problem that incorporates the Weber-Fechner law, serving as a metric for balancing bandwidth utilization and quality of experience (QoE). Specifically, we employ the large language and vision assistant (LLAVA) model to extract critical semantic information from raw image data captured by embodied AI agents (i.e., vehicles), reducing transmission data size by approximately more than 90\% while retaining essential content for vehicular communication and decision-making. In the dynamic vehicular environment, we employ a generalized advantage estimation-based proximal policy optimization (GAE-PPO) method to stabilize decision-making under uncertainty. Simulation results show that attention maps from LLAVA highlight the model's focus on relevant image regions, enhancing semantic representation accuracy. Additionally, our proposed transmission strategy improves QoE by up to 36\% compared to DDPG and accelerates convergence by reducing required steps by up to 47\% compared to pure PPO. Further analysis indicates that adapting semantic symbol length provides an effective trade-off between transmission quality and bandwidth, achieving up to a 61.4\% improvement in QoE when scaling from 4 to 8 vehicles.</p></details> | 14 pages, 10 figures |

However, for robot-generated content (RGC), will its image quality be consistent with the Moravec paradox and counter to human common sense? Human subjective scoring is more based on the attractiveness of the image. Embodied agent are required to interact and perceive in the environment, and finally perform specific tasks. Visual images as inputs directly influence downstream tasks. In this paper, we first propose an embodied image quality assessment (EIQA) frameworks. We establish assessment metrics for input images based on the downstream tasks of robot. In addition, we construct an Embodied Preference Database (EPD) containing 5,000 reference and distorted image annotations. The performance of mainstream IQA algorithms on EPD dataset is finally verified. The experiments demonstrate that quality assessment of embodied images is different from that of humans. We sincerely hope that the EPD can contribute to the development of embodied AI by focusing on image quality assessment.

However, LAE also faces challenges in data collection and processing efficiency, flight control precision, and network performance. The challenges could be solved by realizing an integration of sensing, communications, computation, and control (ISC3) for LAE. In this regard, embodied artificial intelligence (EAI), with its unique perception, planning, and decision-making capabilities, offers a promising solution to realize ISC3. Specifically, this paper investigates an application of EAI into ISC3 to support LAE, exploring potential research focuses, solutions, and case study. We begin by outlining rationales and benefits of introducing EAI into LAE, followed by reviewing research directions and solutions for EAI in ISC3. We then propose a framework of an EAI-enabled ISC3 for LAE. The framework's effectiveness is evaluated through a case study of express delivery utilizing an EAI-enabled UAV. Finally, we discuss several future research directions for advancing EAI-enabled LAE.</p></details> |  |

While these approaches, which combine high-level planners with low-level controllers, show promise, low-level controllers frequently become performance bottlenecks due to repeated failures. In this paper, we argue that the primary cause of failure in many low-level controllers is the absence of an episodic memory system. To address this, we introduce MrSteve (Memory Recall Steve-1), a novel low-level controller equipped with Place Event Memory (PEM), a form of episodic memory that captures what, where, and when information from episodes. This directly addresses the main limitation of the popular low-level controller, Steve-1. Unlike previous models that rely on short-term memory, PEM organizes spatial and event-based data, enabling efficient recall and navigation in long-horizon tasks. Additionally, we propose an Exploration Strategy and a Memory-Augmented Task Solving Framework, allowing agents to alternate between exploration and task-solving based on recalled events. Our approach significantly improves task-solving and exploration efficiency compared to existing methods. We will release our code and demos on the project page: https://sites.google.com/view/mr-steve.</p></details> |  |

Our GameFi ecosystem aims to fundamentally transform this landscape by integrating advanced embodied AI agents into GameFi platforms. These AI agents, developed using cutting-edge large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 and Claude AI, are capable of proactive, adaptive, and contextually rich interactions with players. By going beyond traditional scripted responses, these agents become integral participants in the game's narrative and economic systems, directly influencing player strategies and in-game economies. We address the limitations of current GameFi platforms, which often lack immersive AI interactions and mechanisms for community engagement or creator monetization. Through the deep integration of AI agents with blockchain technology, we establish a consensus-driven, decentralized GameFi ecosystem. This ecosystem empowers creators to monetize their contributions and fosters democratic collaboration among players and creators. Furthermore, by embedding DeFi mechanisms into the gaming experience, we enhance economic participation and provide new opportunities for financial interactions within the game. Our approach enhances player immersion and retention and advances the GameFi ecosystem by bridging traditional gaming with Web3 technologies. By integrating sophisticated AI and DeFi elements, we contribute to the development of more engaging, economically robust, and community-centric gaming environments. This project represents a significant advancement in the state-of-the-art in GameFi, offering insights and methodologies that can be applied throughout the gaming industry.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

Despite significant progress in handling complex environments using deep reinforcement learning, current PGN methods are designed for single-robot systems, limiting their generalizability to multi-robot scenarios with diverse platforms. This paper addresses this limitation by proposing a knowledge transfer framework for PGN, allowing a teacher robot to transfer its learned navigation model to student robots, including those with unknown or black-box platforms. We introduce a novel knowledge distillation (KD) framework that transfers first-person-view (FPV) representations (view images, turning/forward actions) to universally applicable third-person-view (TPV) representations (local maps, subgoals). The state is redefined as reconstructed local maps using SLAM, while actions are mapped to subgoals on a predefined grid. To enhance training efficiency, we propose a sampling-efficient KD approach that aligns training episodes via a noise-robust local map descriptor (LMD). Although validated on 2D wheeled robots, this method can be extended to 3D action spaces, such as drones. Experiments conducted in Habitat-Sim demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed framework, requiring minimal implementation effort. This study highlights the potential for scalable and cross-platform PGN solutions, expanding the applicability of embodied AI systems in multi-robot scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Draft...</summary><p>Draft version of a conference paper: 5 pages with 2 figures</p></details> |

However, due to the lack of comprehensive 3D benchmarks, the capabilities of 3D models in real-world scenes, particularly those that are challenging with subtly distinguished objects, remain insufficiently investigated. To facilitate a more thorough evaluation of 3D models' capabilities, we propose a scheme, ObjVariantEnsemble, to systematically introduce more scenes with specified object classes, colors, shapes, quantities, and spatial relationships to meet model evaluation needs. More importantly, we intentionally construct scenes with similar objects to a certain degree and design an LLM-VLM-cooperated annotator to capture key distinctions as annotations. The resultant benchmark can better challenge 3D models, reveal their shortcomings in understanding, and potentially aid in the further development of 3D models.</p></details> | Accepted to AAAI2025 |

The agent uses this world model to restore a shuffled scene to its original configuration, making an accurate representation of the world essential for successfully completing the task. In this work, we present a novel framework that leverages on 3D Gaussian Splatting as a 3D scene representation for experience goal visual rearrangement task. Recent advances in volumetric scene representation like 3D Gaussian Splatting, offer fast rendering of high quality and photo-realistic novel views. Our approach enables the agent to have consistent views of the current and the goal setting of the rearrangement task, which enables the agent to directly compare the goal state and the shuffled state of the world in image space. To compare these views, we propose to use a dense feature matching method with visual features extracted from a foundation model, leveraging its advantages of a more universal feature representation, which facilitates robustness, and generalization. We validate our approach on the AI2-THOR rearrangement challenge benchmark and demonstrate improvements over the current state of the art methods</p></details> |  |

However, current mainstream navigation strategies that leverage such incomplete maps as workspace prior knowledge often fail in modern long-term autonomy long-distance travel scenarios where map accumulation errors become significant. To address these limitations of map-based navigation, this paper is the first to explore mapless navigation in the embodied AI field, in particular, to utilize object-goal navigation (commonly abbreviated as ON, ObjNav, or OGN) techniques that efficiently explore target objects without using such a prior map. Specifically, in this work, we start from an off-the-shelf mapless ON planner, extend it to utilize a prior map, and further show that the performance in long-distance ALC (LD-ALC) can be maximized by minimizing ``ALC loss" and ``ON loss". This study highlights a simple and effective approach, called ALC-ON (ALCON), to accelerate the progress of challenging long-distance ALC technology by leveraging the growing frontier-guided, data-driven, and LLM-guided ON technologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Draft...</summary><p>Draft version of a conference paper with 7 pages, 5 figures, and 1 table</p></details> |

However, current robots struggle to fully and accurately interpret human intentions from voice commands alone. Traditional gripper and suction systems often fail to interact naturally with humans, lack advanced manipulation capabilities, and are not adaptable to diverse tasks, especially in unstructured environments. This paper introduces the Embodied Dexterous Grasping System (EDGS), designed to tackle object grasping in cluttered environments for human-robot interaction. We propose a novel approach to semantic-object alignment using a Vision-Language Model (VLM) that fuses voice commands and visual information, significantly enhancing the alignment of multi-dimensional attributes of target objects in complex scenarios. Inspired by human hand-object interactions, we develop a robust, precise, and efficient grasping strategy, incorporating principles like the thumb-object axis, multi-finger wrapping, and fingertip interaction with an object's contact mechanics. We also design experiments to assess Referring Expression Representation Enrichment (RERE) in referring expression segmentation, demonstrating that our system accurately detects and matches referring expressions. Extensive experiments confirm that EDGS can effectively handle complex grasping tasks, achieving stability and high success rates, highlighting its potential for further development in the field of Embodied AI.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, our focus lies in areas such as Embodied AI, Games, UI Control, and Planning. To this end, we introduce a process of adapting an MLLM to a Generalist Embodied Agent (GEA). GEA is a single unified model capable of grounding itself across these varied domains through a multi-embodiment action tokenizer. GEA is trained with supervised learning on a large dataset of embodied experiences and with online RL in interactive simulators. We explore the data and algorithmic choices necessary to develop such a model. Our findings reveal the importance of training with cross-domain data and online RL for building generalist agents. The final GEA model achieves strong generalization performance to unseen tasks across diverse benchmarks compared to other generalist models and benchmark-specific approaches.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we study how to best ground a MLLM into different embodiments and their associated action spaces, with the goal of leveraging the multimodal world knowledge of the MLLM. We first generalize a number of methods through a unified architecture and the lens of action space adaptors. For continuous actions, we show that a learned tokenization allows for sufficient modeling precision, yielding the best performance on downstream tasks. For discrete actions, we demonstrate that semantically aligning these actions with the native output token space of the MLLM leads to the strongest performance. We arrive at these lessons via a thorough study of seven action space adapters on five different environments, encompassing over 114 embodied tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, previous work has been scattered across diverse simulation platforms, with assets and models lacking unified interfaces, which has led to inefficiencies in research. To address this, we introduce InfiniteWorld, a unified and scalable simulator for general vision-language robot interaction built on Nvidia Isaac Sim. InfiniteWorld encompasses a comprehensive set of physics asset construction methods and generalized free robot interaction benchmarks. Specifically, we first built a unified and scalable simulation framework for embodied learning that integrates a series of improvements in generation-driven 3D asset construction, Real2Sim, automated annotation framework, and unified 3D asset processing. This framework provides a unified and scalable platform for robot interaction and learning. In addition, to simulate realistic robot interaction, we build four new general benchmarks, including scene graph collaborative exploration and open-world social mobile manipulation. The former is often overlooked as an important task for robots to explore the environment and build scene knowledge, while the latter simulates robot interaction tasks with different levels of knowledge agents based on the former. They can more comprehensively evaluate the embodied agent's capabilities in environmental understanding, task planning and execution, and intelligent interaction. We hope that this work can provide the community with a systematic asset interface, alleviate the dilemma of the lack of high-quality assets, and provide a more comprehensive evaluation of robot interactions.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

This study finds that state-of-the-art embodied AI agents compete for higher navigation quality, but often compromise the computational efficiency. To address this issue, we introduce "Skip-SCAR," an optimization framework that builds computationally and memory-efficient embodied AI agents to accomplish high-quality visual navigation tasks. Skip-SCAR opportunistically skips the redundant step computations during semantic segmentation and local re-planning without hurting the navigation quality. Skip-SCAR also adopts a novel hybrid sparse and dense network for object prediction, optimizing both the computation and memory footprint.

Privacy emerges as a pivotal concern within the realm of embodied AI, as the robot accesses substantial personal information. However, the issue of privacy leakage in embodied AI tasks, particularly concerning reinforcement learning algorithms, has not received adequate consideration in research. This paper aims to address this gap by proposing an attack on the training process of the value-based algorithm and the gradient-based algorithm, utilizing gradient inversion to reconstruct states, actions, and supervisory signals. The choice of using gradients for the attack is motivated by the fact that commonly employed federated learning techniques solely utilize gradients computed based on private user data to optimize models, without storing or transmitting the data to public servers. Nevertheless, these gradients contain sufficient information to potentially expose private data. To validate our approach, we conducted experiments on the AI2THOR simulator and evaluated our algorithm on active perception, a prevalent task in embodied AI. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in successfully reconstructing all information from the data in 120 room layouts.

In this paper, we propose TANGO, an approach that extends the program composition via LLMs already observed for images, aiming to integrate those capabilities into embodied agents capable of observing and acting in the world. Specifically, by employing a simple PointGoal Navigation model combined with a memory-based exploration policy as a foundational primitive for guiding an agent through the world, we show how a single model can address diverse tasks without additional training. We task an LLM with composing the provided primitives to solve a specific task, using only a few in-context examples in the prompt. We evaluate our approach on three key Embodied AI tasks: Open-Set ObjectGoal Navigation, Multi-Modal Lifelong Navigation, and Open Embodied Question Answering, achieving state-of-the-art results without any specific fine-tuning in challenging zero-shot scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Functionality understanding is highly challenging, as it requires both world knowledge to interpret language and spatial perception to identify fine-grained objects. For example, given a task like 'turn on the ceiling light', an embodied AI agent must infer that it needs to locate the light switch, even though the switch is not explicitly mentioned in the task description. To date, no dedicated methods have been developed for this problem. In this paper, we introduce Fun3DU, the first approach designed for functionality understanding in 3D scenes. Fun3DU uses a language model to parse the task description through Chain-of-Thought reasoning in order to identify the object of interest. The identified object is segmented across multiple views of the captured scene by using a vision and language model. The segmentation results from each view are lifted in 3D and aggregated into the point cloud using geometric information. Fun3DU is training-free, relying entirely on pre-trained models. We evaluate Fun3DU on SceneFun3D, the most recent and only dataset to benchmark this task, which comprises over 3000 task descriptions on 230 scenes. Our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art open-vocabulary 3D segmentation approaches.

Despite recent advancements in Neural Implicit Representations (NIR), existing methods often lack editability and compositional flexibility, limiting their use in scenarios requiring high interactivity and object-level manipulation. In this paper, we introduce the Gaussian Object Carver (GOC), a novel, efficient, and scalable framework for object-compositional 3D scene reconstruction. GOC leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS), enriched with monocular geometry priors and multi-view geometry regularization, to achieve high-quality and flexible reconstruction. Furthermore, we propose a zero-shot Object Surface Completion (OSC) model, which uses 3D priors from 3d object data to reconstruct unobserved surfaces, ensuring object completeness even in occluded areas. Experimental results demonstrate that GOC improves reconstruction efficiency and geometric fidelity. It holds promise for advancing the practical application of digital twins in embodied AI, AR/VR, and interactive simulation environments.</p></details> |  |

VLN is a challenging task that involves an agent following human instructions and navigating in a previously unknown environment to reach a specified goal. Recent work in literature focuses on different ways to augment the available datasets of instructions for improving navigation performance by exploiting synthetic training data. In this work, we propose AIGeN, a novel architecture inspired by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) that produces meaningful and well-formed synthetic instructions to improve navigation agents' performance. The model is composed of a Transformer decoder (GPT-2) and a Transformer encoder (BERT). During the training phase, the decoder generates sentences for a sequence of images describing the agent's path to a particular point while the encoder discriminates between real and fake instructions. Experimentally, we evaluate the quality of the generated instructions and perform extensive ablation studies. Additionally, we generate synthetic instructions for 217K trajectories using AIGeN on Habitat-Matterport 3D Dataset (HM3D) and show an improvement in the performance of an off-the-shelf VLN method. The validation analysis of our proposal is conducted on REVERIE and R2R and highlights the promising aspects of our proposal, achieving state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to 7th Multimodal Learning and Applications Workshop (MULA 2024) at the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition 2024</p></details> |

But: does that noise matter? We find that nonsensical or irrelevant language instructions during pretraining can have little effect on downstream performance for both HAMT and VLN-BERT on R2R, and is still better than only using clean, human data. To underscore these results, we concoct an efficient augmentation method, Unigram + Object, which generates nonsensical instructions that nonetheless improve downstream performance. Our findings suggest that what matters for VLN R2R pretraining is the quantity of visual trajectories, not the quality of instructions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by O-DRUM @ CVPR 2023</p></details> |
| **[Bridging the visual gap in VLN via semantically richer instructions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15565v1)** | 2022-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Visual-and-Language Navigation (VLN) task requires understanding a textual instruction to navigate a natural indoor environment using only visual information. While this is a trivial task for most humans, it is still an open problem for AI models. In this work, we hypothesize that poor use of the visual information available is at the core of the low performance of current models. To support this hypothesis, we provide experimental evidence showing that state-of-the-art models are not severely affected when they receive just limited or even no visual data, indicating a strong overfitting to the textual instructions. To encourage a more suitable use of the visual information, we propose a new data augmentation method that fosters the inclusion of more explicit visual information in the generation of textual navigational instructions. Our main intuition is that current VLN datasets include textual instructions that are intended to inform an expert navigator, such as a human, but not a beginner visual navigational agent, such as a randomly initialized DL model. Specifically, to bridge the visual semantic gap of current VLN datasets, we take advantage of metadata available for the Matterport3D dataset that, among others, includes information about object labels that are present in the scenes. Training a state-of-the-art model with the new set of instructions increase its performance by 8% in terms of success rate on unseen environments, demonstrating the advantages of the proposed data augmentation method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ECCV 2022.

The widespread adoption of instruction-tuned image-to-text vision-language assistants (VLAs) like LLaVA and InternVL necessitates evaluating gender biases. We study gender bias in 22 popular open-source VLAs with respect to personality traits, skills, and occupations. Our results show that VLAs replicate human biases likely present in the data, such as real-world occupational imbalances. Similarly, they tend to attribute more skills and positive personality traits to women than to men, and we see a consistent tendency to associate negative personality traits with men. To eliminate the gender bias in these models, we find that fine-tuning-based debiasing methods achieve the best trade-off between debiasing and retaining performance on downstream tasks. We argue for pre-deploying gender bias assessment in VLAs and motivate further development of debiasing strategies to ensure equitable societal outcomes.

| **[Refined Policy Distillation: From VLA Generalists to RL Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05833v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent generalist Vision-Language-Action Models (VLAs) can perform a variety of tasks on real robots with remarkable generalization capabilities. However, reported success rates are often not on par with those of expert policies. Moreover, VLAs usually do not work out of the box and often must be fine-tuned as they are sensitive to setup changes. In this work, we present Refined Policy Distillation (RPD), an RL-based policy refinement method that enables the distillation of large generalist models into small, high-performing expert policies. The student policy is guided during the RL exploration by actions of a teacher VLA for increased sample efficiency and faster convergence. Different from previous work that focuses on applying VLAs to real-world experiments, we create fine-tuned versions of Octo and OpenVLA for ManiSkill2 to evaluate RPD in simulation. As our results for different manipulation tasks demonstrate, RPD enables the RL agent to learn expert policies that surpass the teacher's performance in both dense and sparse reward settings. Our approach is even robust to changes in the camera perspective and can generalize to task variations that the underlying VLA cannot solve.</p></details> |  |
| **[VLA Model-Expert Collaboration for Bi-directional Manipulation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04163v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of vision-language-action (VLA) models has given rise to foundation models for robot manipulation. Although these models have achieved significant improvements, their generalization in multi-task manipulation remains limited. This study proposes a VLA model-expert collaboration framework that leverages a limited number of expert actions to enhance VLA model performance. This approach reduces expert workload relative to manual operation while simultaneously improving the reliability and generalization of VLA models. Furthermore, manipulation data collected during collaboration can further refine the VLA model, while human participants concurrently enhance their skills. This bi-directional learning loop boosts the overall performance of the collaboration system. Experimental results across various VLA models demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system in collaborative manipulation and learning, as evidenced by improved success rates across tasks. Additionally, validation using a brain-computer interface (BCI) indicates that the collaboration system enhances the efficiency of low-speed action systems by involving VLA model during manipulation. These promising results pave the way for advancing human-robot interaction in the era of foundation models for robotics. (Project website: https://aoqunjin.github.io/Expert-VLA/)</p></details> |  |

This research explores the integration of advanced algorithms that enable drones to adapt their navigation strategies based on real-time environmental feedback, mimicking the decision-making processes of human pilots. The model, fine-tuned on a collected racing drone dataset, demonstrates strong generalization despite the complexity of drone racing environments. RaceVLA outperforms OpenVLA in motion (75.0 vs 60.0) and semantic generalization (45.5 vs 36.3), benefiting from the dynamic camera and simplified motion tasks. However, visual (79.6 vs 87.0) and physical (50.0 vs 76.7) generalization were slightly reduced due to the challenges of maneuvering in dynamic environments with varying object sizes. RaceVLA also outperforms RT-2 across all axes - visual (79.6 vs 52.0), motion (75.0 vs 55.0), physical (50.0 vs 26.7), and semantic (45.5 vs 38.8), demonstrating its robustness for real-time adjustments in complex environments. Experiments revealed an average velocity of 1.04 m/s, with a maximum speed of 2.02 m/s, and consistent maneuverability, demonstrating RaceVLA's ability to handle high-speed scenarios effectively. These findings highlight the potential of RaceVLA for high-performance navigation in competitive racing contexts.

Trained on a dataset comprising over 8,000 simulated flight trajectories across three key categories-Human Recognition, Symbol Understanding, and Reasoning-the model generates real-time 4D action commands based on first-person visual inputs and textual instructions. To further enhance performance in intricate scenarios, we propose CognitiveDrone-R1, which integrates an additional Vision-Language Model (VLM) reasoning module to simplify task directives prior to high-frequency control. Experimental evaluations using our open-source benchmark, CognitiveDroneBench, reveal that while a racing-oriented model (RaceVLA) achieves an overall success rate of 31.3%, the base CognitiveDrone model reaches 59.6%, and CognitiveDrone-R1 attains a success rate of 77.2%. These results demonstrate improvements of up to 30% in critical cognitive tasks, underscoring the effectiveness of incorporating advanced reasoning capabilities into UAV control systems. Our contributions include the development of a state-of-the-art VLA model for UAV control and the introduction of the first dedicated benchmark for assessing cognitive tasks in drone operations.

| **[VLAS: Vision-Language-Action Model With Speech Instructions For Customized Robot Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13508v2)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language-action models (VLAs) have become increasingly popular in robot manipulation for their end-to-end design and remarkable performance. However, existing VLAs rely heavily on vision-language models (VLMs) that only support text-based instructions, neglecting the more natural speech modality for human-robot interaction. Traditional speech integration methods usually involves a separate speech recognition system, which complicates the model and introduces error propagation. Moreover, the transcription procedure would lose non-semantic information in the raw speech, such as voiceprint, which may be crucial for robots to successfully complete customized tasks. To overcome above challenges, we propose VLAS, a novel end-to-end VLA that integrates speech recognition directly into the robot policy model. VLAS allows the robot to understand spoken commands through inner speech-text alignment and produces corresponding actions to fulfill the task. We also present two new datasets, SQA and CSI, to support a three-stage tuning process for speech instructions, which empowers VLAS with the ability of multimodal interaction across text, image, speech, and robot actions. Taking a step further, a voice retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) paradigm is designed to enable our model to effectively handle tasks that require individual-specific knowledge. Our extensive experiments show that VLAS can effectively accomplish robot manipulation tasks with diverse speech commands, offering a seamless and customized interaction experience.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a conference paper at ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[ConRFT: A Reinforced Fine-tuning Method for VLA Models via Consistency Policy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05450v1)** | 2025-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown substantial potential in real-world robotic manipulation. However, fine-tuning these models through supervised learning struggles to achieve robust performance due to limited, inconsistent demonstrations, especially in contact-rich environments. In this paper, we propose a reinforced fine-tuning approach for VLA models, named ConRFT, which consists of offline and online fine-tuning with a unified consistency-based training objective, to address these challenges. In the offline stage, our method integrates behavior cloning and Q-learning to effectively extract policy from a small set of demonstrations and stabilize value estimating. In the online stage, the VLA model is further fine-tuned via consistency policy, with human interventions to ensure safe exploration and high sample efficiency. We evaluate our approach on eight diverse real-world manipulation tasks. It achieves an average success rate of 96.3% within 45-90 minutes of online fine-tuning, outperforming prior supervised methods with a 144% improvement in success rate and 1.9x shorter episode length. This work highlights the potential of integrating reinforcement learning to enhance the performance of VLA models for real-world robotic applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Dual Process VLA: Efficient Robotic Manipulation Leveraging VLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15549v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are receiving increasing attention for their ability to enable robots to perform complex tasks by integrating visual context with linguistic commands. However, achieving efficient real-time performance remains challenging due to the high computational demands of existing models. To overcome this, we propose Dual Process VLA (DP-VLA), a hierarchical framework inspired by dual-process theory. DP-VLA utilizes a Large System 2 Model (L-Sys2) for complex reasoning and decision-making, while a Small System 1 Model (S-Sys1) handles real-time motor control and sensory processing. By leveraging Vision-Language Models (VLMs), the L-Sys2 operates at low frequencies, reducing computational overhead, while the S-Sys1 ensures fast and accurate task execution. Experimental results on the RoboCasa dataset demonstrate that DP-VLA achieves faster inference and higher task success rates, providing a scalable solution for advanced robotic applications.</p></details> | 10 page |
| **[Mobility VLA: Multimodal Instruction Navigation with Long-Context VLMs and Topological Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07775v2)** | 2024-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An elusive goal in navigation research is to build an intelligent agent that can understand multimodal instructions including natural language and image, and perform useful navigation. To achieve this, we study a widely useful category of navigation tasks we call Multimodal Instruction Navigation with demonstration Tours (MINT), in which the environment prior is provided through a previously recorded demonstration video. Recent advances in Vision Language Models (VLMs) have shown a promising path in achieving this goal as it demonstrates capabilities in perceiving and reasoning about multimodal inputs. However, VLMs are typically trained to predict textual output and it is an open research question about how to best utilize them in navigation. To solve MINT, we present Mobility VLA, a hierarchical Vision-Language-Action (VLA) navigation policy that combines the environment understanding and common sense reasoning power of long-context VLMs and a robust low-level navigation policy based on topological graphs. The high-level policy consists of a long-context VLM that takes the demonstration tour video and the multimodal user instruction as input to find the goal frame in the tour video. Next, a low-level policy uses the goal frame and an offline constructed topological graph to generate robot actions at every timestep. We evaluated Mobility VLA in a 836m^2 real world environment and show that Mobility VLA has a high end-to-end success rates on previously unsolved multimodal instructions such as "Where should I return this?" while holding a plastic bin.

Recently, diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools for cloud removal, delivering higher-quality estimation by sampling from cloud-free distributions, compared to earlier methods. However, diffusion models initiate sampling from pure Gaussian noise, which complicates the sampling trajectory and results in suboptimal performance. Also, current methods fall short in effectively fusing SAR and optical data. To address these limitations, we propose Diffusion Bridges for Cloud Removal, DB-CR, which directly bridges between the cloudy and cloud-free image distributions. In addition, we propose a novel multimodal diffusion bridge architecture with a two-branch backbone for multimodal image restoration, incorporating an efficient backbone and dedicated cross-modality fusion blocks to effectively extract and fuse features from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical images. By formulating cloud removal as a diffusion-bridge problem and leveraging this tailored architecture, DB-CR achieves high-fidelity results while being computationally efficient. We evaluated DB-CR on the SEN12MS-CR cloud-removal dataset, demonstrating that it achieves state-of-the-art results.</p></details> |  |

In real-world clinical scenarios, different sets of magnetic resonance (MR) contrasts are often acquired for different subjects/cases, creating challenges for deep learning models assuming consistent input modalities among all the cases and between pretrain and finetune. Existing methods struggle to maintain performance when there is an input modality/contrast set mismatch with the pretrained model, often resulting in degraded accuracy. We propose an adaptive Vision Transformer (AdaViT) framework capable of handling variable set of input modalities for each case. We utilize a dynamic tokenizer to encode different input image modalities to tokens and take advantage of the characteristics of the transformer to build attention mechanism across variable length of tokens. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that this architecture effectively transfers supervised pretrained models to new datasets with different input modality/contrast sets, resulting in superior performance on zero-shot testing, few-shot finetuning, and backward transferring in brain infarct and brain tumor segmentation tasks. Additionally, for self-supervised pretrain, the proposed method is able to maximize the pretrain data and facilitate transferring to diverse downstream tasks with variable sets of input modalities.</p></details> |  |

However, despite their effectiveness, they lack interpretability, as they are unable to explain or justify their results. To address the challenge of interpretable image classification, this paper introduces a novel framework, named Interpretable Intuitionistic Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (I2FCMs).Intuitionistic FCMs (iFCMs) have been proposed as an extension of FCMs offering a natural mechanism to assess the quality of their output through the estimation of hesitancy, a concept resembling human hesitation in decision making. In the context of image classification, hesitancy is considered as a degree of unconfidence with which an image is categorized to a class. To the best of our knowledge this is the first time iFCMs are applied for image classification. Further novel contributions of the introduced framework include the following: a) a feature extraction process focusing on the most informative image regions; b) a learning algorithm for automatic data-driven determination of the intuitionistic fuzzy interconnections of the iFCM, thereby reducing human intervention in the definition of the graph structure; c) an inherently interpretable classification approach based on image contents, providing understandable explanations of its predictions, using linguistic terms. Furthermore, the proposed I2FCM framework can be applied to DL models, including Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), rendering them interpretable. The effectiveness of I2FCM is evaluated on publicly available datasets, and the results confirm that it can provide enhanced classification performance, while providing interpretable inferences.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted for possible journal publication</p></details> |
| **[Optimistic Learning for Communication Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03499v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI/ML-based tools are at the forefront of resource management solutions for communication networks. Deep learning, in particular, is highly effective in facilitating fast and high-performing decision-making whenever representative training data is available to build offline accurate models. Conversely, online learning solutions do not require training and enable adaptive decisions based on runtime observations, alas are often overly conservative. This extensive tutorial proposes the use of optimistic learning (OpL) as a decision engine for resource management frameworks in modern communication systems. When properly designed, such solutions can achieve fast and high-performing decisions -- comparable to offline-trained models -- while preserving the robustness and performance guarantees of the respective online learning approaches. We introduce the fundamental concepts, algorithms and results of OpL, discuss the roots of this theory and present different approaches to defining and achieving optimism. We proceed to showcase how OpL can enhance resource management in communication networks for several key problems such as caching, edge computing, network slicing, and workload assignment in decentralized O-RAN platforms. Finally, we discuss the open challenges that must be addressed to unlock the full potential of this new resource management approach.</p></details> |  |

While Deep Learning (DL) methods have demonstrated strong forecasting capabilities, their adoption in industrial CPS remains limited due insufficient robustness. Existing robustness evaluations primarily focus on formal verification or adversarial perturbations, inadequately representing the complexities encountered in real-world CPS scenarios. To address this, we introduce a practical robustness definition grounded in distributional robustness, explicitly tailored to industrial CPS, and propose a systematic framework for robustness evaluation. Our framework simulates realistic disturbances, such as sensor drift, noise and irregular sampling, enabling thorough robustness analyses of forecasting models on real-world CPS datasets. The robustness definition provides a standardized score to quantify and compare model performance across diverse datasets, assisting in informed model selection and architecture design. Through extensive empirical studies evaluating prominent DL architectures (including recurrent, convolutional, attention-based, modular, and structured state-space models) we demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of our approach. We publicly release our robustness benchmark to encourage further research and reproducibility.</p></details> |  |

Approaches to exploit such possibilities often result in either i) a limited number of projections or spatial information due to limited scanning speed, as in time-resolved tomography, or ii) a limited number of time points, as in stroboscopic imaging, making the reconstruction problem ill-posed and unlikely to be solved by classical reconstruction approaches. 4D reconstruction from such data requires sample priors, which can be included via deep learning (DL). State-of-the-art 4D reconstruction methods for X-ray imaging combine the power of AI and the physics of X-ray propagation to tackle the challenge of sparse views. However, most approaches do not constrain the physics of the studied process, i.e., a full physical model. Here we present 4D physics-informed optimized neural implicit X-ray imaging (4D-PIONIX), a novel physics-informed 4D X-ray image reconstruction method combining the full physical model and a state-of-the-art DL-based reconstruction method for 4D X-ray imaging from sparse views. We demonstrate and evaluate the potential of our approach by retrieving 4D information from ultra-sparse spatiotemporal acquisitions of simulated binary droplet collisions, a relevant fluid dynamic process. We envision that this work will open new spatiotemporal possibilities for various 4D X-ray imaging modalities, such as time-resolved X-ray tomography and more novel sparse acquisition approaches like X-ray multi-projection imaging, which will pave the way for investigations of various rapid 4D dynamics, such as fluid dynamics and composite testing.</p></details> |  |

Despite their wide applicability, processing multi-channel audio signals from microphone arrays in SSL involves computationally intensive matrix operations, which can hinder efficient deployment on Central Processing Units (CPUs), particularly in embedded systems with limited CPU resources. This paper introduces a GPU-based implementation of SSL for robot audition, utilizing the Generalized Singular Value Decomposition-based Multiple Signal Classification (GSVD-MUSIC), a noise-robust algorithm, within the HARK platform, an open-source software suite. For a 60-channel microphone array, the proposed implementation achieves significant performance improvements. On the Jetson AGX Orin, an embedded device powered by an NVIDIA GPU and ARM Cortex-A78AE v8.2 64-bit CPUs, we observe speedups of 4645.1x for GSVD calculations and 8.8x for the SSL module, while speedups of 2223.4x for GSVD calculation and 8.95x for the entire SSL module on a server configured with an NVIDIA A100 GPU and AMD EPYC 7352 CPUs, making real-time processing feasible for large-scale microphone arrays and providing ample capacity for real-time processing of potential subsequent machine learning or deep learning tasks.</p></details> | 6 pages, 2 figures |

We consider a legitimate communication link in the presence of multiple jammers and propose deploying a movable antenna array at the receiver to combat jamming attacks. We formulate the problem as a signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio maximization, by jointly optimizing the receive beamforming and antenna element positioning. Due to the non-convexity and multi-fold difficulties from an optimization perspective, we develop a deep learning-based framework where beamforming is tackled as a Rayleigh quotient problem, while antenna positioning is addressed through multi-layer perceptron training. The neural network parameters are optimized using stochastic gradient descent to achieve effective jamming mitigation strategy, featuring offline training with marginal complexity for online inference. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves near-optimal anti-jamming performance thereby significantly improving the efficiency in strategy determination.</p></details> | Accepted @ IEEE TVT |

While previous studies have emphasized the importance of technical indicators and feature engineering, we show that a simple LSTM network trained on raw OHLCV data alone can match the performance of sophisticated ML models that incorporate technical indicators. Using a dataset of Korean stocks from 2006 to 2024, we optimize the triple barrier labeling parameters to achieve balanced label proportions with a 29-day window and 9\% barriers. Our experiments reveal that LSTM networks achieve similar performance to traditional machine learning models like XGBoost, despite using only raw OHLCV data without any technical indicators. Furthermore, we identify that the optimal window size varies with model hidden size, with a configuration of window size 100 and hidden size 8 yielding the best performance. Additionally, our results confirm that using full OHLCV data provides better predictive accuracy compared to using only close price or close price with volume. These findings challenge conventional approaches to feature engineering in financial forecasting and suggest that simpler approaches focusing on raw data and appropriate model selection may be more effective than complex feature engineering strategies.</p></details> | 7 pages, 2 figures |

However, the field faces challenges such as limited large-scale datasets and high data acquisition costs, which hinder the development of robust algorithms. Data augmentation techniques show promise in addressing these issues, but their application to biomechanical time-series data requires comprehensive evaluation. This scoping review investigates data augmentation methods for time-series data in the biomechanics domain. It analyzes current approaches for augmenting and generating time-series datasets, evaluates their effectiveness, and offers recommendations for applying these techniques in biomechanics. Four databases, PubMed, IEEE Xplore, Scopus, and Web of Science, were searched for studies published between 2013 and 2024. Following PRISMA-ScR guidelines, a two-stage screening identified 21 relevant publications. Results show that there is no universally preferred method for augmenting biomechanical time-series data; instead, methods vary based on study objectives. A major issue identified is the absence of soft tissue artifacts in synthetic data, leading to discrepancies referred to as the synthetic gap. Moreover, many studies lack proper evaluation of augmentation methods, making it difficult to assess their effects on model performance and data quality. This review highlights the critical role of data augmentation in addressing limited dataset availability and improving model generalization in biomechanics. Tailoring augmentation strategies to the characteristics of biomechanical data is essential for advancing predictive modeling. A better understanding of how different augmentation methods impact data quality and downstream tasks will be key to developing more effective and realistic techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint under review at PLOS ONE</p></details> |

These metrics enable roto-translation equivariant algorithms, with the associated Riemannian distance often used in implementation. However, computing the Riemannian distance is costly, which makes it unsuitable in situations where constant recomputation is needed. We propose the mav (minimal angular velocity) distance, defined as the Riemannian length of a geometrically meaningful curve, as a practical alternative. We see an application of the mav distance in geometric deep learning. Namely, neural networks architectures such as PONITA, relies on geometric invariants to create their roto-translation equivariant model. The mav distance offers a trainable invariant, with the parameters that determine the Riemannian metric acting as learnable weights. In this paper we: 1) classify and parametrize all SE(3) invariant metrics on M(3), 2) describes how to efficiently calculate the mav distance, and 3) investigate if including the mav distance within PONITA can positively impact its accuracy in predicting molecular properties.</p></details> |  |

These processes lead to remarkable and intricate changes in shape. Modeling and understanding both natural and pathological (or abnormal) changes in the shape of anatomical structures is highly relevant, with applications in diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic healthcare. Nevertheless, modeling the longitudinal shape change of biological tissue is a non-trivial task due to its inherent nonlinear nature. In this review, we highlight several existing methodologies and tools for modeling longitudinal shape change (i.e., spatiotemporal shape modeling). These methods range from diffeomorphic metric mapping to deep-learning based approaches (e.g., autoencoders, generative networks, recurrent neural networks, etc.). We discuss the synergistic combinations of existing technologies and potential directions for future research, underscoring key deficiencies in the current research landscape.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in protein language models (PLMs) have revolutionized computational protein analysis, enabling, among other things, more accurate predictions of mutational effects. In this work, we introduce JanusDDG, a deep learning framework that leverages PLM-derived embeddings and a bidirectional cross-attention transformer architecture to predict $\Delta \Delta G$ of single and multiple-residue mutations while simultaneously being constrained to respect fundamental thermodynamic properties, such as antisymmetry and transitivity. Unlike conventional self-attention, JanusDDG computes queries (Q) and values (V) as the difference between wild-type and mutant embeddings, while keys (K) alternate between the two. This cross-interleaved attention mechanism enables the model to capture mutation-induced perturbations while preserving essential contextual information. Experimental results show that JanusDDG achieves state-of-the-art performance in predicting $\Delta \Delta G$ from sequence alone, matching or exceeding the accuracy of structure-based methods for both single and multiple mutations.</p></details> | 20 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Improving Clinical Imaging Systems using Cognition based Approaches](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03251v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clinical systems operate in safety-critical environments and are not intended to function autonomously; however, they are currently designed to replicate clinicians' diagnoses rather than assist them in the diagnostic process. To enable better supervision of system-generated diagnoses, we replicate radiologists' systematic approach used to analyze chest X-rays. This approach facilitates comprehensive analysis across all regions of clinical images and can reduce errors caused by inattentional blindness and under reading. Our work addresses a critical research gap by identifying difficult-to-diagnose diseases for clinicians using insights from human vision, enabling these systems to serve as an effective "second pair of eyes". These improvements make the clinical imaging systems more complementary and combine the strengths of human and machine vision. Additionally, we leverage effective receptive fields in deep learning models to present machine-generated diagnoses with sufficient context, making it easier for clinicians to evaluate them.</p></details> |  |

While deep learning models have shown high accuracy in AD diagnosis, their lack of interpretability limits clinical trust and adoption. This paper introduces a novel pre-model approach leveraging Jacobian Maps (JMs) within a multi-modal framework to enhance explainability and trustworthiness in AD detection. By capturing localized brain volume changes, JMs establish meaningful correlations between model predictions and well-known neuroanatomical biomarkers of AD. We validate JMs through experiments comparing a 3D CNN trained on JMs versus on traditional preprocessed data, which demonstrates superior accuracy. We also employ 3D Grad-CAM analysis to provide both visual and quantitative insights, further showcasing improved interpretability and diagnostic reliability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Electromyography-Based Gesture Recognition: Hierarchical Feature Extraction for Enhanced Spatial-Temporal Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03221v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hand gesture recognition using multichannel surface electromyography (sEMG) is challenging due to unstable predictions and inefficient time-varying feature enhancement. To overcome the lack of signal based time-varying feature problems, we propose a lightweight squeeze-excitation deep learning-based multi stream spatial temporal dynamics time-varying feature extraction approach to build an effective sEMG-based hand gesture recognition system. Each branch of the proposed model was designed to extract hierarchical features, capturing both global and detailed spatial-temporal relationships to ensure feature effectiveness. The first branch, utilizing a Bidirectional-TCN (Bi-TCN), focuses on capturing long-term temporal dependencies by modelling past and future temporal contexts, providing a holistic view of gesture dynamics. The second branch, incorporating a 1D Convolutional layer, separable CNN, and Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) block, efficiently extracts spatial-temporal features while emphasizing critical feature channels, enhancing feature relevance. The third branch, combining a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) and Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), captures bidirectional temporal relationships and time-varying patterns. Outputs from all branches are fused using concatenation to capture subtle variations in the data and then refined with a channel attention module, selectively focusing on the most informative features while improving computational efficiency. The proposed model was tested on the Ninapro DB2, DB4, and DB5 datasets, achieving accuracy rates of 96.41%, 92.40%, and 93.34%, respectively. These results demonstrate the capability of the system to handle complex sEMG dynamics, offering advancements in prosthetic limb control and human-machine interface technologies with significant implications for assistive technologies.</p></details> |  |

Nonetheless, PPFL is vulnerable to data poisoning attacks due to the distributed training nature of clients. Existing solutions have struggled to improve the performance of cross-silo PPFL in poisoned Non-IID data. To address the issues, this paper proposes a privacy-preserving federated prototype learning framework, named PPFPL, which enhances the cross-silo FL performance in poisoned Non-IID data while effectively resisting data poisoning attacks. Specifically, we adopt prototypes as client-submitted model updates to eliminate the impact of tampered data distribution on federated learning. Moreover, we utilize two servers to achieve Byzantine-robust aggregation by secure aggregation protocol, which greatly reduces the impact of malicious clients. Theoretical analyses confirm the convergence of PPFPL, and experimental results on publicly available datasets show that PPFPL is effective for resisting data poisoning attacks with Non-IID conditions.</p></details> |  |

While deep learning-based object detection has been widely used to improve automobile safety, its application for e-scooter obstacle detection remains unexplored. This study introduces a novel ground obstacle detection system for e-scooters, integrating an RGB camera, and a depth camera to enhance real-time road hazard detection. Additionally, the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) measures linear vertical acceleration to identify surface vibrations, guiding the selection of six obstacle categories: tree branches, manhole covers, potholes, pine cones, non-directional cracks, and truncated domes. All sensors, including the RGB camera, depth camera, and IMU, are integrated within the Intel RealSense Camera D435i. A deep learning model powered by YOLO detects road hazards and utilizes depth data to estimate obstacle proximity. Evaluated on the seven hours of naturalistic riding dataset, the system achieves a high mean average precision (mAP) of 0.827 and demonstrates excellent real-time performance. This approach provides an effective solution to enhance e-scooter safety through advanced computer vision and data fusion. The dataset is accessible at https://zenodo.org/records/14583718, and the project code is hosted on https://github.com/Zeyang-Zheng/Real-Time-Roadway-Obstacle-Detection-for-Electric-Scooters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ASCE International Conference on Computing in Civil Engineering (i3ce)</p></details> |

This paper introduces AMP4EC, an Adaptive Model Partitioning framework designed to optimize deep learning inference in edge environments through real-time resource monitoring, dynamic model partitioning, and adaptive task scheduling. AMP4EC features a resource-aware model partitioner that splits deep learning models based on device capabilities, a task scheduler that ensures efficient load balancing using a weighted scoring mechanism, and a Docker-based deployment environment for validation. Experimental results show up to a 78% reduction in latency and a 414% improvement in throughput compared to baseline methods. The framework achieves consistent performance with low scheduling overhead across varying resource profiles, demonstrating adaptability in high-resource (1 CPU, 1GB RAM) and low-resource (0.4 CPU, 512MB RAM) scenarios. These results highlight AMP4EC's scalability, efficiency, and robustness for real-world edge deployments, addressing the critical need for efficient distributed inference in dynamic, resource-constrained environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, accepted for oral presentation at FMEC 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Unified Model for Compressed Sensing MRI Across Undersampling Patterns](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16290v4)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Compressed Sensing MRI reconstructs images of the body's internal anatomy from undersampled measurements, thereby reducing scan time. Recently, deep learning has shown great potential for reconstructing high-fidelity images from highly undersampled measurements. However, one needs to train multiple models for different undersampling patterns and desired output image resolutions, since most networks operate on a fixed discretization. Such approaches are highly impractical in clinical settings, where undersampling patterns and image resolutions are frequently changed to accommodate different real-time imaging and diagnostic requirements. We propose a unified MRI reconstruction model robust to various measurement undersampling patterns and image resolutions. Our approach uses neural operators, a discretization-agnostic architecture applied in both image and measurement spaces, to capture local and global features. Empirically, our model improves SSIM by 11% and PSNR by 4 dB over a state-of-the-art CNN (End-to-End VarNet), with 600$\times$ faster inference than diffusion methods. The resolution-agnostic design also enables zero-shot super-resolution and extended field-of-view reconstruction, offering a versatile and efficient solution for clinical MR imaging. Our unified model offers a versatile solution for MRI, adapting seamlessly to various measurement undersampling and imaging resolutions, making it highly effective for flexible and reliable clinical imaging.

While recent approaches achieve significant improvements in denoising quality by leveraging deep learning, they are prone to unexpected failures due to discrepancies between training data distributions and the wide variety of noise patterns found in real-world videos. These methods also tend to be slow and lack user control. In contrast, traditional denoising methods perform reliably on in-the-wild videos and run relatively quickly on modern hardware. However, they require manually tuning parameters for each input video, which is not only tedious but also requires skill. We bridge the gap between these two paradigms by proposing a differentiable denoising pipeline based on traditional methods. A neural network is then trained to predict the optimal denoising parameters for each specific input, resulting in a robust and efficient approach that also supports user control.</p></details> | <details><summary>Homep...</summary><p>Homepage: https://srameo.github.io/projects/levd/</p></details> |

The Independent Pixel Approximation (IPA), a widely used physics-based approach, simplifies radiative transfer calculations by assuming each pixel is independent of its neighbors. While computationally efficient, IPA has significant limitations, such as inaccuracies from 3D radiative effects, errors at cloud edges, and ineffectiveness for overlapping or heterogeneous cloud fields. Recent AI/ML-based deep learning models have improved retrieval accuracy by leveraging spatial relationships across pixels. However, these models are often memory-intensive, retrieve only a single cloud property, or struggle with joint property retrievals. To overcome these challenges, we introduce CloudUNet with Attention Module (CAM), a compact UNet-based model that employs attention mechanisms to reduce errors in thick, overlapping cloud regions and a specialized loss function for joint retrieval of Cloud Optical Thickness (COT) and Cloud Effective Radius (CER). Experiments on a Large Eddy Simulation (LES) dataset show that our CAM model outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning methods, reducing mean absolute errors (MAE) by 34% for COT and 42% for CER, and achieving 76% and 86% lower MAE for COT and CER retrievals compared to the IPA method.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 Pag...</summary><p>6 Pages, 4 figures, to be published in 2025 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS 2025)</p></details> |

Recent insights from traditional deep learning indicate high-dimensional models possess intrinsic, low-rank structure. In this work, we introduce low-rank, factorized neuroevolution: an indirect encoding through which we can search a small space of low-rank factors that enforce underlying structure across a network's weights. We compare our approach with non-factorized networks of similar and smaller size to understand how much performance can be attributed to the smaller search space. We evaluate our method on a language modeling task using transformers, as well as continuous and discrete vision-based reinforcement learning tasks. Our study shows that low-rank, factorized neuroevolution outperforms or is competitive with non-factorized neuroevolution, performing notably well on language modeling. Our results also suggest deleterious factorized mutations have a stronger negative impact on performance than deleterious non-factorized mutations, which significantly reduces the runtime on environments with early termination for bad performers. More broadly, these results show how we can use insights from backpropgation-based methods to enhance neuroevolution</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-marginal Schrödinger Bridges with Iterative Reference Refinement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06277v4)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Practitioners often aim to infer an unobserved population trajectory using sample snapshots at multiple time points. E.g., given single-cell sequencing data, scientists would like to learn how gene expression changes over a cell's life cycle. But sequencing any cell destroys that cell. So we can access data for any particular cell only at a single time point, but we have data across many cells. The deep learning community has recently explored using Schr\"odinger bridges (SBs) and their extensions in similar settings. However, existing methods either (1) interpolate between just two time points or (2) require a single fixed reference dynamic (often set to Brownian motion within SBs). But learning piecewise from adjacent time points can fail to capture long-term dependencies. And practitioners are typically able to specify a model family for the reference dynamic but not the exact values of the parameters within it. So we propose a new method that (1) learns the unobserved trajectories from sample snapshots across multiple time points and (2) requires specification only of a family of reference dynamics, not a single fixed one. We demonstrate the advantages of our method on simulated and real data.</p></details> | 39 pages, 9 figures |

Facial expressions can be classified into 7 categories: angry, disgust, fear, happy, neutral, sad and surprise. How to detect and recognize these seven emotions has become a popular topic in the past decade. In this paper, we develop an emotion recognition system that can apply emotion recognition on both still images and real-time videos by using deep learning. We build our own emotion recognition classification and regression system from scratch, which includes dataset collection, data preprocessing , model training and testing. Given a certain image or a real-time video, our system is able to show the classification and regression results for all of the 7 emotions. The proposed system is tested on 2 different datasets, and achieved an accuracy of over 80\%. Moreover, the result obtained from real-time testing proves the feasibility of implementing convolutional neural networks in real time to detect emotions accurately and efficiently.</p></details> |  |

However, it is difficult to collect large real-world visual datasets in this domain, in part due to privacy and expense constraints, which in turn presents significant challenges for training and deploying deep learning models. Existing in-bed human mesh estimation methods often rely heavily on real-world data, limiting their ability to generalize across different in-bed scenarios, such as varying coverings and environmental settings. To address this, we propose a Sim-to-Real Transfer Framework for in-bed human mesh recovery from overhead depth images, which leverages large-scale synthetic data alongside limited or no real-world samples. We introduce a diffusion model that bridges the gap between synthetic data and real data to support generalization in real-world in-bed pose and body inference scenarios. Extensive experiments and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our framework, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness and adaptability across diverse healthcare scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 19 figures.

Vision-based tactile sensors are promising for providing multimodal capabilities and high robustness, yet existing technologies still have limitations in sensitivity, spatial resolution, and high computational demands of deep learning-based image processing. This paper presents a comprehensive approach combining a novel microstructure-based sensor design and efficient image processing, demonstrating that carefully engineered microstructures can significantly enhance performance while reducing computational load. Without traditional tracking markers, our sensor incorporates an surface with micromachined trenches, as an example of microstructures, which modulate light transmission and amplify the response to applied force. The amplified image features can be extracted by a ultra lightweight convolutional neural network to accurately inferring contact location, displacement, and applied force with high precision. Through theoretical analysis, we demonstrated that the micro trenches significantly amplified the visual effects of shape distortion. Using only a commercial webcam, the sensor system effectively detected forces below 5 mN, and achieved a millimetre-level single-point spatial resolution. Using a model with only one convolutional layer, a mean absolute error below 0.05 mm was achieved. Its soft sensor body allows seamless integration with soft robots, while its immunity to electrical crosstalk and interference guarantees reliability in complex human-machine environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>41 pa...</summary><p>41 pages, 28 figures, 2 tables; rearranged figures; updated supplymentary information</p></details> |
| **[Explanation Space: A New Perspective into Time Series Interpretability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01354v3)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human understandable explanation of deep learning models is essential for various critical and sensitive applications. Unlike image or tabular data where the importance of each input feature (for the classifier's decision) can be directly projected into the input, time series distinguishable features (e.g. dominant frequency) are often hard to manifest in time domain for a user to easily understand. Additionally, most explanation methods require a baseline value as an indication of the absence of any feature. However, the notion of lack of feature, which is often defined as black pixels for vision tasks or zero/mean values for tabular data, is not well-defined in time series. Despite the adoption of explainable AI methods (XAI) from tabular and vision domain into time series domain, these differences limit the application of these XAI methods in practice. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective method that allows a model originally trained on the time domain to be interpreted in other explanation spaces using existing methods. We suggest five explanation spaces, each of which can potentially alleviate these issues in certain types of time series. Our method can be easily integrated into existing platforms without any changes to trained models or XAI methods. The code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Online Hybrid-Belief POMDP with Coupled Semantic-Geometric Models and Semantic Safety Awareness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11202v3)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robots operating in complex and unknown environments frequently require geometric-semantic representations of the environment to safely perform their tasks. While inferring the environment, they must account for many possible scenarios when planning future actions. Since objects' class types are discrete and the robot's self-pose and the objects' poses are continuous, the environment can be represented by a hybrid discrete-continuous belief which is updated according to models and incoming data. Prior probabilities and observation models representing the environment can be learned from data using deep learning algorithms. Such models often couple environmental semantic and geometric properties. As a result, semantic variables are interconnected, causing semantic state space dimensionality to increase exponentially. In this paper, we consider planning under uncertainty using partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) with hybrid semantic-geometric beliefs. The models and priors consider the coupling between semantic and geometric variables. Within POMDP, we introduce the concept of semantically aware safety. Obtaining representative samples of the theoretical hybrid belief, required for estimating the value function, is very challenging. As a key contribution, we develop a novel form of the hybrid belief and leverage it to sample representative samples. We show that under certain conditions, the value function and probability of safety can be calculated efficiently with an explicit expectation over all possible semantic mappings. Our simulations show that our estimates of the objective function and probability of safety achieve similar levels of accuracy compared to estimators that run exhaustively on the entire semantic state-space using samples from the theoretical hybrid belief. Nevertheless, the complexity of our estimators is polynomial rather than exponential.</p></details> | 18 pages, 11 figures |
| **[HQViT: Hybrid Quantum Vision Transformer for Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02730v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based architectures have revolutionized the landscape of deep learning. In computer vision domain, Vision Transformer demonstrates remarkable performance on par with or even surpassing that of convolutional neural networks. However, the quadratic computational complexity of its self-attention mechanism poses challenges for classical computing, making model training with high-dimensional input data, e.g., images, particularly expensive. To address such limitations, we propose a Hybrid Quantum Vision Transformer (HQViT), that leverages the principles of quantum computing to accelerate model training while enhancing model performance. HQViT introduces whole-image processing with amplitude encoding to better preserve global image information without additional positional encoding. By leveraging quantum computation on the most critical steps and selectively handling other components in a classical way, we lower the cost of quantum resources for HQViT. The qubit requirement is minimized to $O(log_2N)$ and the number of parameterized quantum gates is only $O(log_2d)$, making it well-suited for Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum devices. By offloading the computationally intensive attention coefficient matrix calculation to the quantum framework, HQViT reduces the classical computational load by $O(T^2d)$. Extensive experiments across various computer vision datasets demonstrate that HQViT outperforms existing models, achieving a maximum improvement of up to $10.9\%$ (on the MNIST 10-classification task) over the state of the art. This work highlights the great potential to combine quantum and classical computing to cope with complex image classification tasks.</p></details> | 13 pages, 8 figures |

Although numerous deep learning-based turbulence mitigation (TM) methods have been proposed, many are slow, memory-hungry, and do not generalize well. In the spatial domain, methods based on convolutional operators have a limited receptive field, so they cannot handle a large spatial dependency required by turbulence. In the temporal domain, methods relying on self-attention can, in theory, leverage the lucky effects of turbulence, but their quadratic complexity makes it difficult to scale to many frames. Traditional recurrent aggregation methods face parallelization challenges. In this paper, we present a new TM method based on two concepts: (1) A turbulence mitigation network based on the Selective State Space Model (MambaTM). MambaTM provides a global receptive field in each layer across spatial and temporal dimensions while maintaining linear computational complexity. (2) Learned Latent Phase Distortion (LPD). LPD guides the state space model. Unlike classical Zernike-based representations of phase distortion, the new LPD map uniquely captures the actual effects of turbulence, significantly improving the model's capability to estimate degradation by reducing the ill-posedness. Our proposed method exceeds current state-of-the-art networks on various synthetic and real-world TM benchmarks with significantly faster inference speed.

Nonetheless, black-and-white analog photographs present considerable challenges for modern object detection frameworks due to their limited spatial resolution, absence of color information, and archival degradation. To address these challenges, this research introduces a two-stage image enhancement pipeline based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs): image colorization utilizing DeOldify, followed by super-resolution enhancement with Real-ESRGAN. The enhanced images were subsequently employed to train and evaluate rooftop detection models, including Faster R-CNN, DETReg, and YOLOv11n. The results demonstrate that the combination of colorization with super-resolution significantly enhances detection performance, with YOLOv11n achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP) exceeding 85\%. This signifies an enhancement of approximately 40\% over the original black-and-white images and 20\% over images enhanced solely through colorization. The proposed method effectively bridges the gap between archival imagery and contemporary deep learning techniques, facilitating more reliable extraction of building footprints from historical aerial photographs.

Recent remarkable progress in deep learning-based methods makes it possible to generate satisfactory segmentation results. However, existing methods still face challenges in adapting network parameters to various land cover distributions and enhancing the interaction between spatial and frequency domain features. To address these challenges, we propose the Adaptive Frequency Enhancement Network (AFENet), which integrates two key components: the Adaptive Frequency and Spatial feature Interaction Module (AFSIM) and the Selective feature Fusion Module (SFM). AFSIM dynamically separates and modulates high- and low-frequency features according to the content of the input image. It adaptively generates two masks to separate high- and low-frequency components, therefore providing optimal details and contextual supplementary information for ground object feature representation. SFM selectively fuses global context and local detailed features to enhance the network's representation capability. Hence, the interactions between frequency and spatial features are further enhanced. Extensive experiments on three publicly available datasets demonstrate that the proposed AFENet outperforms state-of-the-art methods. In addition, we also validate the effectiveness of AFSIM and SFM in managing diverse land cover types and complex scenarios.

Graph Convolutional Networks and Graph Transformers have achieved superior performance in node classification tasks. However, the key concern with Graph Convolutional Networks is over-squashing, which limits their ability to capture long-range dependencies in the network. Additionally, Graph Transformers face scalability challenges, making it difficult to process large graphs efficiently. To address this, we propose a novel framework, A Hybrid SImilarity-Aware Graph Neural Network with Transformer for Node Classification (SIGNNet), which capitalizes on local and global structural information, enhances the model's capability to effectively capture fine-grained relationships and broader contextual patterns within the graph structure. The proposed method leverages Graph Convolutional Networks alongside a score-based mechanism to effectively capture local and global node interactions while addressing the limitations of over-squashing. Our proposed method employs a novel Personalized PageRank-based node sampling method to address scalability issues by generating subgraphs of nodes. Additionally, SIGNNet incorporates a novel attention mechanism, Structure-Aware Multi-Head Attention (SA-MHA), which integrates node structural information for informed attention weighting, enabling the model to prioritize nodes based on topological significance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the significant improvements achieved by the proposed method over existing state-of-the-art methods, with average accuracy gains of 6.03%, 5.47%, 4.78%, 19.10%, 19.61%, 7.22%, 19.54%, and 14.94% on Cora, Citeseer, CS, Wisconsin, Texas, Actor, Cornell and Chameleon datasets, respectively.</p></details> |  |

Realistic analysis of Leukemia requires White Blook Cells (WBC) localization, classification, and morphological assessment. Despite deep learning advances in medical imaging, leukemia analysis lacks a large, diverse multi-task dataset, while existing small datasets lack domain diversity, limiting real world applicability. To overcome dataset challenges, we present a large scale WBC dataset named Large Leukemia Dataset (LLD) and novel methods for detecting WBC with their attributes. Our contribution here is threefold. First, we present a large-scale Leukemia dataset collected through Peripheral Blood Films (PBF) from several patients, through multiple microscopes, multi cameras, and multi magnification. To enhance diagnosis explainability and medical expert acceptance, each leukemia cell is annotated at 100x with 7 morphological attributes, ranging from Cell Size to Nuclear Shape. Secondly, we propose a multi task model that not only detects WBCs but also predicts their attributes, providing an interpretable and clinically meaningful solution. Third, we propose a method for WBC detection with attribute analysis using sparse annotations. This approach reduces the annotation burden on hematologists, requiring them to mark only a small area within the field of view. Our method enables the model to leverage the entire field of view rather than just the annotated regions, enhancing learning efficiency and diagnostic accuracy. From diagnosis explainability to overcoming domain shift challenges, presented datasets could be used for many challenging aspects of microscopic image analysis. The datasets, code, and demo are available at: https://im.itu.edu.pk/sparse-leukemiaattri/</p></details> | Under Review |

Four approaches and their comparative evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02586v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces four different artificial intelligence algorithms for music generation and aims to compare these methods not only based on the aesthetic quality of the generated music but also on their suitability for specific applications. The first set of melodies is produced by a slightly modified visual transformer neural network that is used as a language model. The second set of melodies is generated by combining chat sonification with a classic transformer neural network (the same method of music generation is presented in a previous research), the third set of melodies is generated by combining the Schillinger rhythm theory together with a classic transformer neural network, and the fourth set of melodies is generated using GPT3 transformer provided by OpenAI. A comparative analysis is performed on the melodies generated by these approaches and the results indicate that significant differences can be observed between them and regarding the aesthetic value of them, GPT3 produced the most pleasing melodies, and the newly introduced Schillinger method proved to generate better sounding music than previous sonification methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reasoning Inconsistencies and How to Mitigate Them in Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02577v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent advancements in Deep Learning models and techniques have led to significant strides in performance across diverse tasks and modalities. However, while the overall capabilities of models show promising growth, our understanding of their internal reasoning processes remains limited, particularly concerning systematic inconsistencies or errors patterns of logical or inferential flaws. These inconsistencies may manifest as contradictory outputs, failure to generalize across similar tasks, or erroneous conclusions in specific contexts. Even detecting and measuring such reasoning discrepancies is challenging, as they may arise from opaque internal procedures, biases and imbalances in training data, or the inherent complexity of the task. Without effective methods to detect, measure, and mitigate these errors, there is a risk of deploying models that are biased, exploitable, or logically unreliable. This thesis aims to address these issues by producing novel methods for deep learning models that reason over knowledge graphs, natural language, and images. The thesis contributes two techniques for detecting and quantifying predictive inconsistencies originating from opaque internal procedures in natural language and image processing models. To mitigate inconsistencies from biases in training data, this thesis presents a data efficient sampling method to improve fairness and performance and a synthetic dataset generation approach in low resource scenarios. Finally, the thesis offers two techniques to optimize the models for complex reasoning tasks. These methods enhance model performance while allowing for more faithful and interpretable exploration and exploitation during inference. Critically, this thesis provides a comprehensive framework to improve the robustness, fairness, and interpretability of deep learning models across diverse tasks and modalities.</p></details> | PhD thesis |

In this paper, we address a novel task: rip current instance segmentation. We introduce a comprehensive dataset containing $2,466$ images with newly created polygonal annotations for instance segmentation, used for training and validation. Additionally, we present a novel dataset comprising $17$ drone videos (comprising about $24K$ frames) captured at $30 FPS$, annotated with both polygons for instance segmentation and bounding boxes for object detection, employed for testing purposes. We train various versions of YOLOv8 for instance segmentation on static images and assess their performance on the test dataset (videos). The best results were achieved by the YOLOv8-nano model (runnable on a portable device), with an mAP50 of $88.94%$ on the validation dataset and $81.21%$ macro average on the test dataset. The results provide a baseline for future research in rip current segmentation. Our work contributes to the existing literature by introducing a detailed, annotated dataset, and training a deep learning model for instance segmentation of rip currents. The code, training details and the annotated dataset are made publicly available at https://github.com/Irikos/rip_currents.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2023 NTIRE Workshop</p></details> |

Recent advancements in the field of deep learning have demonstrated success in a variety of clinical tasks: detecting diabetic retinopathy from images, predicting hospital readmissions, aiding in the discovery of new drugs, etc. AI's progress in medicine, however, has led to concerns regarding the potential effects of this technology upon relationships of trust in clinical practice. In this paper, I will argue that there is merit to these concerns, since AI systems can be relied upon, and are capable of reliability, but cannot be trusted, and are not capable of trustworthiness. Insofar as patients are required to rely upon AI systems for their medical decision-making, there is potential for this to produce a deficit of trust in relationships in clinical practice.</p></details> |  |

The option pricing partial differential equation is reformulated as an energy minimization problem, which is approximated in a time-stepping fashion by deep artificial neural networks. The proposed scheme respects the asymptotic behavior of option prices for large levels of moneyness, and adheres to a priori known bounds for option prices. The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method is assessed in a series of numerical examples, with particular focus in the lifted Heston model.</p></details> | 16 pages, 6 figures |

However, CT multi-organ segmentation methods based on masked image modeling (MIM) are very limited. There are already methods using MAE for CT multi-organ segmentation task, we believe that the existing methods do not identify the most difficult areas to reconstruct. To this end, we propose a MIM self-training framework with hard patches mining masked autoencoders for CT multi-organ segmentation tasks (selfMedHPM). The method performs ViT self-pretraining on the training set of the target data and introduces an auxiliary loss predictor, which first predicts the patch loss and determines the location of the next mask. SelfMedHPM implementation is better than various competitive methods in abdominal CT multi-organ segmentation and body CT multi-organ segmentation. We have validated the performance of our method on the Multi Atlas Labeling Beyond The Cranial Vault (BTCV) dataset for abdomen mult-organ segmentation and the SinoMed Whole Body (SMWB) dataset for body multi-organ segmentation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2304.05919 by other authors</p></details> |

While various PDF parsing tools exist, their effectiveness across different document types remains understudied, especially beyond academic papers. Our research aims to address this gap by comparing 10 popular PDF parsing tools across 6 document categories using the DocLayNet dataset. These tools include PyPDF, pdfminer-six, PyMuPDF, pdfplumber, pypdfium2, Unstructured, Tabula, Camelot, as well as the deep learning-based tools Nougat and Table Transformer(TATR). We evaluated both text extraction and table detection capabilities. For text extraction, PyMuPDF and pypdfium generally outperformed others, but all parsers struggled with Scientific and Patent documents. For these challenging categories, learning-based tools like Nougat demonstrated superior performance. In table detection, TATR excelled in the Financial, Patent, Law & Regulations, and Scientific categories. Table detection tool Camelot performed best for tender documents, while PyMuPDF performed superior in the Manual category. Our findings highlight the importance of selecting appropriate parsing tools based on document type and specific tasks, providing valuable insights for researchers and practitioners working with diverse document sources.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages,11 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Industrial Internet Robot Collaboration System and Edge Computing Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02492v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In a complex environment, for a mobile robot to safely and collision - free avoid all obstacles, it poses high requirements for its intelligence level. Given that the information such as the position and geometric characteristics of obstacles is random, the control parameters of the robot, such as velocity and angular velocity, are also prone to random deviations. To address this issue in the framework of the Industrial Internet Robot Collaboration System, this paper proposes a global path control scheme for mobile robots based on deep learning. First of all, the dynamic equation of the mobile robot is established. According to the linear velocity and angular velocity of the mobile robot, its motion behaviors are divided into obstacle - avoidance behavior, target - turning behavior, and target approaching behavior. Subsequently, the neural network method in deep learning is used to build a global path planning model for the robot. On this basis, a fuzzy controller is designed with the help of a fuzzy control algorithm to correct the deviations that occur during path planning, thereby achieving optimized control of the robot's global path. In addition, considering edge computing optimization, the proposed model can process local data at the edge device, reducing the communication burden between the robot and the central server, and improving the real time performance of path planning. The experimental results show that for the mobile robot controlled by the research method in this paper, the deviation distance of the path angle is within 5 cm, the deviation convergence can be completed within 10 ms, and the planned path is shorter. This indicates that the proposed scheme can effectively improve the global path planning ability of mobile robots in the industrial Internet environment and promote the collaborative operation of robots through edge computing optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Haphazard Inputs as Images in Online Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02912v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The field of varying feature space in online learning settings, also known as haphazard inputs, is very prominent nowadays due to its applicability in various fields. However, the current solutions to haphazard inputs are model-dependent and cannot benefit from the existing advanced deep-learning methods, which necessitate inputs of fixed dimensions. Therefore, we propose to transform the varying feature space in an online learning setting to a fixed-dimension image representation on the fly. This simple yet novel approach is model-agnostic, allowing any vision-based models to be applicable for haphazard inputs, as demonstrated using ResNet and ViT. The image representation handles the inconsistent input data seamlessly, making our proposed approach scalable and robust. We show the efficacy of our method on four publicly available datasets.

| **[Geometric Median Matching for Robust k-Subset Selection from Noisy Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00564v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data pruning -- the combinatorial task of selecting a small and representative subset from a large dataset, is crucial for mitigating the enormous computational costs associated with training data-hungry modern deep learning models at scale. Since large scale data collections are invariably noisy, developing data pruning strategies that remain robust even in the presence of corruption is critical in practice. However, existing data pruning methods often fail under high corruption rates due to their reliance on empirical mean estimation, which is highly sensitive to outliers. In response, we propose Geometric Median (GM) Matching, a novel k-subset selection strategy that leverages Geometric Median -- a robust estimator with an optimal breakdown point of 1/2; to enhance resilience against noisy data. Our method iteratively selects a k-subset such that the mean of the subset approximates the GM of the (potentially) noisy dataset, ensuring robustness even under arbitrary corruption. We provide theoretical guarantees, showing that GM Matching enjoys an improved O(1/k) convergence rate -- a quadratic improvement over random sampling, even under arbitrary corruption. Extensive experiments across image classification and image generation tasks demonstrate that GM Matching consistently outperforms existing pruning approaches, particularly in high-corruption settings and at high pruning rates; making it a strong baseline for robust data pruning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Attention-Driven Bayesian Deep Unrolling for Dual-Peak Single-Photon Lidar Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02480v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Single-photon Lidar imaging offers a significant advantage in 3D imaging due to its high resolution and long-range capabilities, however it is challenging to apply in noisy environments with multiple targets per pixel. To tackle these challenges, several methods have been proposed. Statistical methods demonstrate interpretability on the inferred parameters, but they are often limited in their ability to handle complex scenes. Deep learning-based methods have shown superior performance in terms of accuracy and robustness, but they lack interpretability or they are limited to a single-peak per pixel. In this paper, we propose a deep unrolling algorithm for dual-peak single-photon Lidar imaging. We introduce a hierarchical Bayesian model for multiple targets and propose a neural network that unrolls the underlying statistical method. To support multiple targets, we adopt a dual depth maps representation and exploit geometric deep learning to extract features from the point cloud. The proposed method takes advantages of statistical methods and learning-based methods in terms of accuracy and quantifying uncertainty. The experimental results on synthetic and real data demonstrate the competitive performance when compared to existing methods, while also providing uncertainty information.</p></details> |  |

Over the past two decades, a common method for mapping stand borders has involved delineation through manual interpretation of stereographic aerial images. This is a time-consuming and subjective process, limiting operational efficiency and introducing inconsistencies. Substantial effort has been devoted to automating the process, using various algorithms together with aerial images and canopy height models constructed from airborne laser scanning (ALS) data, but manual interpretation remains the preferred method. Deep learning (DL) methods have demonstrated great potential in computer vision, yet their application to forest stand delineation remains unexplored in published research. This study presents a novel approach, framing stand delineation as a multiclass segmentation problem and applying a U-Net based DL framework. The model was trained and evaluated using multispectral images, ALS data, and an existing stand map created by an expert interpreter. Performance was assessed on independent data using overall accuracy, a standard metric for classification tasks that measures the proportions of correctly classified pixels. The model achieved an overall accuracy of 0.73. These results demonstrate strong potential for DL in automated stand delineation. However, a few key challenges were noted, especially for complex forest environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 7 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

This vulnerability pose significant risks in high-stakes applications such as autonomous vehicles, security surveillance, and safety-critical inspection systems. While the existing literature extensively covers adversarial attacks in image classification, comprehensive analyses of such attacks on object detection systems remain limited. This paper presents a novel taxonomic framework for categorizing adversarial attacks specific to object detection architectures, synthesizes existing robustness metrics, and provides a comprehensive empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art attack methodologies on popular object detection models, including both traditional detectors and modern detectors with vision-language pretraining. Through rigorous analysis of open-source attack implementations and their effectiveness across diverse detection architectures, we derive key insights into attack characteristics. Furthermore, we delineate critical research gaps and emerging challenges to guide future investigations in securing object detection systems against adversarial threats. Our findings establish a foundation for developing more robust detection models while highlighting the urgent need for standardized evaluation protocols in this rapidly evolving domain.</p></details> | 17 pages |
| **[TileLink: Generating Efficient Compute-Communication Overlapping Kernels using Tile-Centric Primitives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20313v3)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in a wide range of tasks. These models often necessitate distributed systems for efficient training and inference. The fundamental building blocks for distributed model execution are intra-layer parallel operators. The most effective approach to enhancing the performance of intra-layer parallel operators involves overlapping computation with communication. The overlapping can be achieved through either operator decomposition or kernel fusion. While decomposing operators is straightforward to implement, it often results in suboptimal performance. On the other hand, fusing communication kernels with compute kernels demands significant expertise and is error-prone. In this paper, we propose TileLink to enable efficient compilation and generation of overlapped compute-communication kernels. TileLink is composed of frontend and backend. In the frontend, TileLink decouples the design space of communication and computation, linking these two parts via tile-centric primitives. In the backend, TileLink translates these primitives into low-level communication instructions, integrating the communication and computation components to achieve overlapped execution. In experiments, TileLink achieves from $1.17\times$ to $20.76\times$ speedup to non-overlapping baseline and achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art overlapping libraries on GPUs.</p></details> |  |

Electroencephalography (EEG), as an objective tool for identifying brain disorders, holds great promise. However, extracting meaningful and reliable features from high-dimensional EEG data, especially by integrating spatiotemporal brain dynamics into informative representations, remains a major challenge. In this study, we introduce an advanced semi-supervised adversarial network, NSSI-Net, to effectively model EEG features related to NSSI. NSSI-Net consists of two key modules: a spatial-temporal feature extraction module and a multi-concept discriminator. In the spatial-temporal feature extraction module, an integrated 2D convolutional neural network (2D-CNN) and a bi-directional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) are used to capture both spatial and temporal dynamics in EEG data. In the multi-concept discriminator, signal, gender, domain, and disease levels are fully explored to extract meaningful EEG features, considering individual, demographic, disease variations across a diverse population. Based on self-collected NSSI data (n=114), the model's effectiveness and reliability are demonstrated, with a 5.44% improvement in performance compared to existing machine learning and deep learning methods. This study advances the understanding and early diagnosis of NSSI in adolescents with depression, enabling timely intervention.

| **[Towards Assessing Deep Learning Test Input Generators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02329v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep Learning (DL) systems are increasingly deployed in safety-critical applications, yet they remain vulnerable to robustness issues that can lead to significant failures. While numerous Test Input Generators (TIGs) have been developed to evaluate DL robustness, a comprehensive assessment of their effectiveness across different dimensions is still lacking. This paper presents a comprehensive assessment of four state-of-the-art TIGs--DeepHunter, DeepFault, AdvGAN, and SinVAD--across multiple critical aspects: fault-revealing capability, naturalness, diversity, and efficiency. Our empirical study leverages three pre-trained models (LeNet-5, VGG16, and EfficientNetB3) on datasets of varying complexity (MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet-1K) to evaluate TIG performance. Our findings reveal important trade-offs in robustness revealing capability, variation in test case generation, and computational efficiency across TIGs. The results also show that TIG performance varies significantly with dataset complexity, as tools that perform well on simpler datasets may struggle with more complex ones. In contrast, others maintain steadier performance or better scalability. This paper offers practical guidance for selecting appropriate TIGs aligned with specific objectives and dataset characteristics. Nonetheless, more work is needed to address TIG limitations and advance TIGs for real-world, safety-critical systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EASE 2025</p></details> |
| **[Temporal Gaussian Copula For Clinical Multivariate Time Series Data Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02317v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The imputation of the Multivariate time series (MTS) is particularly challenging since the MTS typically contains irregular patterns of missing values due to various factors such as instrument failures, interference from irrelevant data, and privacy regulations. Existing statistical methods and deep learning methods have shown promising results in time series imputation. In this paper, we propose a Temporal Gaussian Copula Model (TGC) for three-order MTS imputation. The key idea is to leverage the Gaussian Copula to explore the cross-variable and temporal relationships based on the latent Gaussian representation. Subsequently, we employ an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to improve robustness in managing data with varying missing rates. Comprehensive experiments were conducted on three real-world MTS datasets. The results demonstrate that our TGC substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art imputation methods. Additionally, the TGC model exhibits stronger robustness to the varying missing ratios in the test dataset.

| **[Theoretical Insights in Model Inversion Robustness and Conditional Entropy Maximization for Collaborative Inference Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00383v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>By locally encoding raw data into intermediate features, collaborative inference enables end users to leverage powerful deep learning models without exposure of sensitive raw data to cloud servers. However, recent studies have revealed that these intermediate features may not sufficiently preserve privacy, as information can be leaked and raw data can be reconstructed via model inversion attacks (MIAs). Obfuscation-based methods, such as noise corruption, adversarial representation learning, and information filters, enhance the inversion robustness by obfuscating the task-irrelevant redundancy empirically. However, methods for quantifying such redundancy remain elusive, and the explicit mathematical relation between this redundancy minimization and inversion robustness enhancement has not yet been established. To address that, this work first theoretically proves that the conditional entropy of inputs given intermediate features provides a guaranteed lower bound on the reconstruction mean square error (MSE) under any MIA. Then, we derive a differentiable and solvable measure for bounding this conditional entropy based on the Gaussian mixture estimation and propose a conditional entropy maximization (CEM) algorithm to enhance the inversion robustness. Experimental results on four datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of our proposed CEM; without compromising feature utility and computing efficiency, plugging the proposed CEM into obfuscation-based defense mechanisms consistently boosts their inversion robustness, achieving average gains ranging from 12.9\% to 48.2\%.

Despite several research efforts to address this, they often fail to consider the real-world demand from users for complete knowledge erasure. Furthermore, our investigation reveals that existing methods have a risk of leaking personal knowledge through embedding features. To address these issues, we introduce a novel concept of Knowledge Deletion (KD), an advanced task that considers both concerns, and provides an appropriate metric, named Knowledge Retention score (KR), for assessing knowledge retention in feature space. To achieve this, we propose a novel training-free erasing approach named Erasing Space Concept (ESC), which restricts the important subspace for the forgetting knowledge by eliminating the relevant activations in the feature. In addition, we suggest ESC with Training (ESC-T), which uses a learnable mask to better balance the trade-off between forgetting and preserving knowledge in KD. Our extensive experiments on various datasets and models demonstrate that our proposed methods achieve the fastest and state-of-the-art performance. Notably, our methods are applicable to diverse forgetting scenarios, such as facial domain setting, demonstrating the generalizability of our methods.

| **[Efficient Model-Based Deep Learning via Network Pruning and Fine-Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02003v2)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model-based deep learning (MBDL) is a powerful methodology for designing deep models to solve imaging inverse problems. MBDL networks can be seen as iterative algorithms that estimate the desired image using a physical measurement model and a learned image prior specified using a convolutional neural net (CNNs). The iterative nature of MBDL networks increases the test-time computational complexity, which limits their applicability in certain large-scale applications. Here we make two contributions to address this issue: First, we show how structured pruning can be adopted to reduce the number of parameters in MBDL networks. Second, we present three methods to fine-tune the pruned MBDL networks to mitigate potential performance loss. Each fine-tuning strategy has a unique benefit that depends on the presence of a pre-trained model and a high-quality ground truth. We show that our pruning and fine-tuning approach can accelerate image reconstruction using popular deep equilibrium learning (DEQ) and deep unfolding (DU) methods by 50% and 32%, respectively, with nearly no performance loss. This work thus offers a step forward for solving inverse problems by showing the potential of pruning to improve the scalability of MBDL.

Many existing deep-learning-based methods for analyzing colonoscopic videos either require task-specific fine-tuning, lack tracking capabilities, or rely on domain-specific pre-training. In this paper, we introduce PolypSegTrack, a novel foundation model that jointly addresses polyp detection, segmentation, classification and unsupervised tracking in colonoscopic videos. Our approach leverages a novel conditional mask loss, enabling flexible training across datasets with either pixel-level segmentation masks or bounding box annotations, allowing us to bypass task-specific fine-tuning. Our unsupervised tracking module reliably associates polyp instances across frames using object queries, without relying on any heuristics. We leverage a robust vision foundation model backbone that is pre-trained unsupervisedly on natural images, thereby removing the need for domain-specific pre-training. Extensive experiments on multiple polyp benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches in detection, segmentation, classification, and tracking.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Introductory Survey to Autoencoder-based Deep Clustering -- Sandboxes for Combining Clustering with Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02087v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoencoders offer a general way of learning low-dimensional, non-linear representations from data without labels. This is achieved without making any particular assumptions about the data type or other domain knowledge. The generality and domain agnosticism in combination with their simplicity make autoencoders a perfect sandbox for researching and developing novel (deep) clustering algorithms. Clustering methods group data based on similarity, a task that benefits from the lower-dimensional representation learned by an autoencoder, mitigating the curse of dimensionality. Specifically, the combination of deep learning with clustering, called Deep Clustering, enables to learn a representation tailored to specific clustering tasks, leading to high-quality results. This survey provides an introduction to fundamental autoencoder-based deep clustering algorithms that serve as building blocks for many modern approaches.</p></details> |  |

We extend the Latent Shift counterfactual generation method from 2D applications to explain 3D computed tomography (CT) scans classifiers. We address the challenges associated with 3D classifiers, such as limited training samples and high memory demands, by implementing a slice-based autoencoder and gradient blocking except for specific chunks of slices. This method leverages a 2D encoder trained on CT slices, which are subsequently combined to maintain 3D context. We demonstrate this technique on two models for clinical phenotype prediction and lung segmentation. Our approach is both memory-efficient and effective for generating interpretable counterfactuals in high-resolution 3D medical imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and models: https://github.com/ieee8023/ct-counterfactuals</p></details> |

Despite methodological advancements, a comprehensive comparison of competing risk methods, especially in high-dimensional settings, remains limited. This study evaluates penalized regression (LASSO, SCAD, MCP), boosting (CoxBoost, CB), random forest (RF), and deep learning (DeepHit, DH) methods for competing risk analysis through extensive simulations, assessing variable selection, estimation accuracy, discrimination, and calibration under diverse data conditions. Our results show that CB achieves the best variable selection, estimation stability, and discriminative ability, particularly in high-dimensional settings. while MCP and SCAD provide superior calibration in $n>p$ scenarios. RF and DH capture nonlinear effects but exhibit instability, with RF showing high false discovery rates and DH suffering from poor calibration. Further, we compare the flexibility of these methods through the analysis of a melanoma gene expression data with survival information. This study provides practical guidelines for selecting competing risk models to ensure robust and interpretable analysis in high-dimensional settings and outlines important directions for future research.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods often struggle to accurately capture this intricate structure from Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) data, particularly due to the lack of ground truth labels and the ambiguous, intertwined nature of fiber trajectories. We present a novel deep learning framework for unsupervised clustering of myocardial fibers, providing a data-driven approach to identifying distinct fiber bundles. We uniquely combine a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory network to capture local sequential information along fibers, with a Transformer autoencoder to learn global shape features, with pointwise incorporation of essential anatomical context. Clustering these representations using a density-based algorithm identifies 33 to 62 robust clusters, successfully capturing the subtle distinctions in fiber trajectories with varying levels of granularity. Our framework offers a new, flexible, and quantitative way to analyze myocardial structure, achieving a level of delineation that, to our knowledge, has not been previously achieved, with potential applications in improving surgical planning, characterizing disease-related remodeling, and ultimately, advancing personalized cardiac care.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures.

However, these methods often face challenges in balancing adaptability and efficiency in non-convex, high-dimensional settings. This paper introduces AYLA, a novel optimization technique that enhances training dynamics through loss function transformations. By applying a tunable power-law transformation, AYLA preserves critical points while scaling loss values to amplify gradient sensitivity, accelerating convergence. We further propose a dynamic (effective) learning rate that adapts to the transformed loss, improving optimization efficiency. Empirical tests on finding minimum of a synthetic non-convex polynomial, a non-convex curve-fitting dataset, and digit classification (MNIST) demonstrate that AYLA surpasses SGD and ADAM in convergence speed and stability. This approach redefines the loss landscape for better optimization outcomes, offering a promising advancement for deep neural networks and can be applied to any optimization method and potentially improve the performance of it.</p></details> |  |

Detecting seizures quickly and accurately is vital, given the prevalence and severity of the associated complications. Recently, deep learning-based automated seizure detection methods have emerged as solutions; however, most existing methods require extensive post-processing and do not effectively handle the crucial long-range patterns in EEG data. In this work, we propose SeizureTransformer, a simple model comprised of (i) a deep encoder comprising 1D convolutions (ii) a residual CNN stack and a transformer encoder to embed previous output into high-level representation with contextual information, and (iii) streamlined decoder which converts these features into a sequence of probabilities, directly indicating the presence or absence of seizures at every time step. Extensive experiments on public and private EEG seizure detection datasets demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms existing approaches (ranked in the first place in the 2025 "seizure detection challenge" organized in the International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Epilepsy and Other Neurological Disorders), underscoring its potential for real-time, precise seizure detection.</p></details> |  |

Leveraging advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and multi-agent architectures, we propose a novel framework for quantitative stock investment in portfolio management and alpha mining. Our framework addresses these issues by integrating LLMs to generate diversified alphas and employing a multi-agent approach to dynamically evaluate market conditions. This paper proposes a framework where large language models (LLMs) mine alpha factors from multimodal financial data, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of market dynamics. The first module extracts predictive signals by integrating numerical data, research papers, and visual charts. The second module uses ensemble learning to construct a diverse pool of trading agents with varying risk preferences, enhancing strategy performance through a broader market analysis. In the third module, a dynamic weight-gating mechanism selects and assigns weights to the most relevant agents based on real-time market conditions, enabling the creation of an adaptive and context-aware composite alpha formula. Extensive experiments on the Chinese stock markets demonstrate that this framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple financial metrics. The results underscore the efficacy of combining LLM-generated alphas with a multi-agent architecture to achieve superior trading performance and stability. This work highlights the potential of AI-driven approaches in enhancing quantitative investment strategies and sets a new benchmark for integrating advanced machine learning techniques in financial trading can also be applied on diverse markets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Learning for VWAP Execution in Crypto Markets: Beyond the Volume Curve](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13722v2)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) is arguably the most prevalent benchmark for trade execution as it provides an unbiased standard for comparing performance across market participants. However, achieving VWAP is inherently challenging due to its dependence on two dynamic factors, volumes and prices. Traditional approaches typically focus on forecasting the market's volume curve, an assumption that may hold true under steady conditions but becomes suboptimal in more volatile environments or markets such as cryptocurrency where prediction error margins are higher. In this study, I propose a deep learning framework that directly optimizes the VWAP execution objective by bypassing the intermediate step of volume curve prediction. Leveraging automatic differentiation and custom loss functions, my method calibrates order allocation to minimize VWAP slippage, thereby fully addressing the complexities of the execution problem. My results demonstrate that this direct optimization approach consistently achieves lower VWAP slippage compared to conventional methods, even when utilizing a naive linear model presented in arXiv:2410.21448. They validate the observation that strategies optimized for VWAP performance tend to diverge from accurate volume curve predictions and thus underscore the advantage of directly modeling the execution objective. This research contributes a more efficient and robust framework for VWAP execution in volatile markets, illustrating the potential of deep learning in complex financial systems where direct objective optimization is crucial. Although my empirical analysis focuses on cryptocurrency markets, the underlying principles of the framework are readily applicable to other asset classes such as equities.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes ME-rPPG, a memory-efficient algorithm built on temporal-spatial state space duality, which resolves the trilemma of model scalability, cross-dataset generalization, and real-time constraints. Leveraging a transferable state space, ME-rPPG efficiently captures subtle periodic variations across facial frames while maintaining minimal computational overhead, enabling training on extended video sequences and supporting low-latency inference. Achieving cross-dataset MAEs of 5.38 (MMPD), 0.70 (VitalVideo), and 0.25 (PURE), ME-rPPG outperforms all baselines with improvements ranging from 21.3% to 60.2%. Our solution enables real-time inference with only 3.6 MB memory usage and 9.46 ms latency -- surpassing existing methods by 19.5%-49.7% accuracy and 43.2% user satisfaction gains in real-world deployments.

However, existing models often over-smooth important anatomical details due to their purely data-driven attention mechanisms. To address this challenge, we propose a novel LDCT denoising framework, BioAtt. The key innovation lies in attending anatomical prior distributions extracted from the pretrained vision-language model BiomedCLIP. These priors guide the denoising model to focus on anatomically relevant regions to suppress noise while preserving clinically relevant structures. We highlight three main contributions: BioAtt outperforms baseline and attention-based models in SSIM, PSNR, and RMSE across multiple anatomical regions. The framework introduces a new architectural paradigm by embedding anatomic priors directly into spatial attention. Finally, BioAtt attention maps provide visual confirmation that the improvements stem from anatomical guidance rather than increased model complexity.</p></details> | 14 pages |
| **[Sparse Gaussian Neural Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01650v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite significant recent advances in probabilistic meta-learning, it is common for practitioners to avoid using deep learning models due to a comparative lack of interpretability. Instead, many practitioners simply use non-meta-models such as Gaussian processes with interpretable priors, and conduct the tedious procedure of training their model from scratch for each task they encounter. While this is justifiable for tasks with a limited number of data points, the cubic computational cost of exact Gaussian process inference renders this prohibitive when each task has many observations. To remedy this, we introduce a family of models that meta-learn sparse Gaussian process inference. Not only does this enable rapid prediction on new tasks with sparse Gaussian processes, but since our models have clear interpretations as members of the neural process family, it also allows manual elicitation of priors in a neural process for the first time. In meta-learning regimes for which the number of observed tasks is small or for which expert domain knowledge is available, this offers a crucial advantage.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 7th Symposium on Advances in Approximate Bayesian Inference, PMLR, 2025. 25 pages, 6 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Photonic approaches, with low consumption and high operation speed, are increasingly considered for inference but, to date, remain mostly limited to relatively basic tasks. Simultaneously, the problem of training deep and complex neural networks, overwhelmingly performed through backpropagation, remains a significant limitation to the size and, consequently, the performance of current architectures and a major compute and energy bottleneck. Here, we experimentally implement a versatile and scalable training algorithm, called direct feedback alignment, on a hybrid electronic-photonic platform. An optical processing unit performs large-scale random matrix multiplications, which is the central operation of this algorithm, at speeds up to 1500 TeraOPS under 30 Watts of power. We perform optical training of modern deep learning architectures, including Transformers, with more than 1B parameters, and obtain good performances on language, vision, and diffusion-based generative tasks. We study the scaling of the training time, and demonstrate a potential advantage of our hybrid opto-electronic approach for ultra-deep and wide neural networks, thus opening a promising route to sustain the exponential growth of modern artificial intelligence beyond traditional von Neumann approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 4 figures; Additional experiments conducted;</p></details> |
| **[Universality of High-Dimensional Logistic Regression and a Novel CGMT under Dependence with Applications to Data Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15752v2)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the last decade, a wave of research has characterized the exact asymptotic risk of many high-dimensional models in the proportional regime. Two foundational results have driven this progress: Gaussian universality, which shows that the asymptotic risk of estimators trained on non-Gaussian and Gaussian data is equivalent, and the convex Gaussian min-max theorem (CGMT), which characterizes the risk under Gaussian settings. However, these results rely on the assumption that the data consists of independent random vectors--an assumption that significantly limits its applicability to many practical setups. In this paper, we address this limitation by generalizing both results to the dependent setting. More precisely, we prove that Gaussian universality still holds for high-dimensional logistic regression under block dependence, $m$-dependence and special cases of mixing, and establish a novel CGMT framework that accommodates for correlation across both the covariates and observations. Using these results, we establish the impact of data augmentation, a widespread practice in deep learning, on the asymptotic risk.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added extensions to m-dependence and mixing</p></details> |

As part of your LaTeX document you can specify the architecture of a neural network and its loss functions, define how to generate or load training data, and specify training hyperparameters and experiments. When the document is compiled, the LaTeX compiler will generate or load training data, train the network, run experiments, and generate figures. This paper generates a random 100 point spiral dataset, trains a two layer MLP on it, evaluates on a different random spiral dataset, produces plots and tables of results. The paper took 48 hours to compile and the entire source code for NeuRaLaTeX is contained within the source code of the paper. We propose two new metrics: the Written In Latex (WIL) metric measures the proportion of a machine learning library that is written in pure LaTeX, while the Source Code Of Method in Source Code of Paper (SCOMISCOP) metric measures the proportion of a paper's implementation that is contained within the paper source. We are state-of-the-art for both metrics, outperforming the ResNet and Transformer papers, as well as the PyTorch and Tensorflow libraries.

| **[Learning Dual-Arm Push and Grasp Synergy in Dense Clutter](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04052v2)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic grasping in densely cluttered environments is challenging due to scarce collision-free grasp affordances. Non-prehensile actions can increase feasible grasps in cluttered environments, but most research focuses on single-arm rather than dual-arm manipulation. Policies from single-arm systems fail to fully leverage the advantages of dual-arm coordination. We propose a target-oriented hierarchical deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that learns dual-arm push-grasp synergy for grasping objects to enhance dexterous manipulation in dense clutter. Our framework maps visual observations to actions via a pre-trained deep learning backbone and a novel CNN-based DRL model, trained with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), to develop a dual-arm push-grasp strategy. The backbone enhances feature mapping in densely cluttered environments. A novel fuzzy-based reward function is introduced to accelerate efficient strategy learning. Our system is developed and trained in Isaac Gym and then tested in simulations and on a real robot. Experimental results show that our framework effectively maps visual data to dual push-grasp motions, enabling the dual-arm system to grasp target objects in complex environments. Compared to other methods, our approach generates 6-DoF grasp candidates and enables dual-arm push actions, mimicking human behavior. Results show that our method efficiently completes tasks in densely cluttered environments. https://sites.google.com/view/pg4da/home</p></details> |  |
| **[Semi-Supervised Biomedical Image Segmentation via Diffusion Models and Teacher-Student Co-Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01547v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Supervised deep learning for semantic segmentation has achieved excellent results in accurately identifying anatomical and pathological structures in medical images. However, it often requires large annotated training datasets, which limits its scalability in clinical settings. To address this challenge, semi-supervised learning is a well-established approach that leverages both labeled and unlabeled data. In this paper, we introduce a novel semi-supervised teacher-student framework for biomedical image segmentation, inspired by the recent success of generative models. Our approach leverages denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) to generate segmentation masks by progressively refining noisy inputs conditioned on the corresponding images. The teacher model is first trained in an unsupervised manner using a cycle-consistency constraint based on noise-corrupted image reconstruction, enabling it to generate informative semantic masks. Subsequently, the teacher is integrated into a co-training process with a twin-student network. The student learns from ground-truth labels when available and from teacher-generated pseudo-labels otherwise, while the teacher continuously improves its pseudo-labeling capabilities. Finally, to further enhance performance, we introduce a multi-round pseudo-label generation strategy that iteratively improves the pseudo-labeling process. We evaluate our approach on multiple biomedical imaging benchmarks, spanning multiple imaging modalities and segmentation tasks. Experimental results show that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised techniques, highlighting its effectiveness in scenarios with limited annotated data.

In recent years, researchers seek to model to obtain an accurate label distribution by using low-rank, label relations, expert experiences, and label uncertainty estimation. In general, these methods are based on algorithms with parameter learning in a linear (including kernel functions) or deep learning framework. However, these methods are difficult to deploy and update online due to high training costs, limited scalability, and outlier sensitivity. To address this problem, we design a novel LDL method called UAKNN, which has the advantages of the KNN algorithm with the benefits of uncertainty modeling. In addition, we provide solutions to the dilemma of existing work on extremely label distribution spaces. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method is significantly competitive on 12 benchmarks and that the inference speed of the model is well-suited for industrial-level applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Normalized Convolutional Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.05274v4)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a Normalized Convolutional Neural Layer, a novel approach to normalization in convolutional networks. Unlike conventional methods, this layer normalizes the rows of the im2col matrix during convolution, making it inherently adaptive to sliced inputs and better aligned with kernel structures. This distinctive approach differentiates it from standard normalization techniques and prevents direct integration into existing deep learning frameworks optimized for traditional convolution operations. Our method has a universal property, making it applicable to any deep learning task involving convolutional layers. By inherently normalizing within the convolution process, it serves as a convolutional adaptation of Self-Normalizing Networks, maintaining their core principles without requiring additional normalization layers. Notably, in micro-batch training scenarios, it consistently outperforms other batch-independent normalization methods. This performance boost arises from standardizing the rows of the im2col matrix, which theoretically leads to a smoother loss gradient and improved training stability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Muographic Image Upsampling with Machine Learning for Built Infrastructure Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02624v2)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The civil engineering industry faces a critical need for innovative non-destructive evaluation methods, particularly for ageing critical infrastructure, such as bridges, where current techniques fall short. Muography, a non-invasive imaging technique, constructs three-dimensional density maps by detecting interactions of naturally occurring cosmic-ray muons within the scanned volume. Cosmic-ray muons provide deep penetration and inherent safety due to their high momenta and natural source. However, the technology's reliance on this source results in constrained muon flux, leading to prolonged acquisition times, noisy reconstructions and image interpretation challenges. To address these limitations, we developed a two-model deep learning approach. First, we employed a conditional Wasserstein generative adversarial network with gradient penalty (cWGAN-GP) to perform predictive upsampling of undersampled muography images. Using the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM), 1-day sampled images matched the perceptual qualities of a 21-day image, while the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) indicated noise improvement equivalent to 31 days of sampling. A second cWGAN-GP model, trained for semantic segmentation, quantitatively assessed the upsampling model's impact on concrete sample features. This model achieved segmentation of rebar grids and tendon ducts, with Dice-S{\o}rensen accuracy coefficients of 0.8174 and 0.8663. Notably, it could mitigate or remove z-plane smearing artifacts caused by muography's inverse imaging problem. Both models were trained on a comprehensive Geant4 Monte-Carlo simulation dataset reflecting realistic civil infrastructure scenarios. Our results demonstrate significant improvements in acquisition speed and image quality, marking a substantial step toward making muography more practical for reinforced concrete infrastructure monitoring applications.</p></details> |  |

Neural networks and deep learning-based approaches now represent the state-of-the-art to enhance the performance and efficiency of these tasks. Given that satellites are susceptible to various faults, one critical application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is fault detection. However, despite the advantages of neural networks, these systems are vulnerable to radiation errors, which can significantly impact their reliability. Ensuring the dependability of these solutions requires extensive testing and validation, particularly using fault injection methods. This study analyses a physics-informed (PI) real-valued non-volume preserving (Real NVP) normalizing flow model for fault detection in space systems, with a focus on resilience to Single-Event Upsets (SEUs). We present a customized fault injection framework in TensorFlow to assess neural network resilience. Fault injections are applied through two primary methods: Layer State injection, targeting internal network components such as weights and biases, and Layer Output injection, which modifies layer outputs across various activations. Fault types include zeros, random values, and bit-flip operations, applied at varying levels and across different network layers. Our findings reveal several critical insights, such as the significance of bit-flip errors in critical bits, that can lead to substantial performance degradation or even system failure. With this work, we aim to exhaustively study the resilience of Real NVP models against errors due to radiation, providing a means to guide the implementation of fault tolerance measures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Passe...</summary><p>Passed first review at 2025 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)</p></details> |

While various segmentation methods for polyps and skin lesions using fully supervised deep learning techniques have been developed, the pixel-level annotation of medical images by doctors is both time-consuming and costly. Foundational vision models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) have demonstrated superior performance; however, directly applying SAM to medical segmentation may not yield satisfactory results due to the lack of domain-specific medical knowledge. In this paper, we propose BiSeg-SAM, a SAM-guided weakly supervised prompting and boundary refinement network for the segmentation of polyps and skin lesions. Specifically, we fine-tune SAM combined with a CNN module to learn local features. We introduce a WeakBox with two functions: automatically generating box prompts for the SAM model and using our proposed Multi-choice Mask-to-Box (MM2B) transformation for rough mask-to-box conversion, addressing the mismatch between coarse labels and precise predictions. Additionally, we apply scale consistency (SC) loss for prediction scale alignment. Our DetailRefine module enhances boundary precision and segmentation accuracy by refining coarse predictions using a limited amount of ground truth labels. This comprehensive approach enables BiSeg-SAM to achieve excellent multi-task segmentation performance. Our method demonstrates significant superiority over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods when tested on five polyp datasets and one skin cancer dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>2024 ...</summary><p>2024 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)</p></details> |

This letter is the first to explore channel estimation for Pinching-Antenna SyStems (PASS), addressing their uniquely ill-conditioned and underdetermined channel characteristics. In particular, two efficient deep learning-based channel estimators are proposed. 1) PAMoE: This estimator incorporates dynamic padding, feature embedding, fusion, and mixture of experts (MoE) modules, which effectively leverage the positional information of PAs and exploit expert diversity. 2) PAformer: This Transformer-style estimator employs the self-attention mechanism to predict channel coefficients in a per-antenna manner, which offers more flexibility to adaptively deal with dynamic numbers of PAs in practical deployment. Numerical results demonstrate that 1) the proposed deep learning-based channel estimators outperform conventional methods and exhibit excellent zero-shot learning capabilities, and 2) PAMoE delivers higher channel estimation accuracy via MoE specialization, while PAformer natively handles an arbitrary number of PAs, trading self-attention complexity for superior scalability.</p></details> |  |

Existing deep learning methods tend to ignore the information of internal sub-structural features of drug molecules and drug-target interactions, resulting in limited prediction performance. In this paper, we propose a drug-target association prediction model HCAF-DTA based on cross-attention fusion hypergraph neural network. The model innovatively introduces hypergraph representation in the feature extraction stage: drug molecule hypergraphs are constructed based on the tree decomposition algorithm, and the sub-structural and global features extracted by fusing the hypergraph neural network with the graphical neural network through hopping connections, in which the hyper edges can efficiently characterise the functional functional groups and other key chemical features; for the protein feature extraction, a weighted graph is constructed based on the residues predicted by the ESM model contact maps to construct weighted graphs, and multilayer graph neural networks were used to capture spatial dependencies. In the prediction stage, a bidirectional multi-head cross-attention mechanism is designed to model intermolecular interactions from the dual viewpoints of atoms and amino acids, and cross-modal features with correlated information are fused by attention. Experiments on benchmark datasets such as Davis and KIBA show that HCAF-DTA outperforms state of the arts in all three performance evaluation metrics, with the MSE metrics reaching 0.198 and 0.122, respectively, with an improvement of up to 4% from the optimal baseline.</p></details> |  |

Researchers have proposed many variants to enhance the SZZ algorithm's performance since its introduction. The majority of them rely on static techniques or heuristic assumptions, making them easy to implement, but their performance improvements are often limited. Recently, a deep learning-based SZZ algorithm has been introduced to enhance the original SZZ algorithm. However, it requires complex preprocessing and is restricted to a single programming language. Additionally, while it enhances precision, it sacrifices recall. Furthermore, most of variants overlook crucial information, such as commit messages and patch context, and are limited to bug-fixing commits involving deleted lines. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) offers an opportunity to address these drawbacks. In this study, we investigate the strengths and limitations of LLMs and propose LLM4SZZ, which employs two approaches (i.e., rank-based identification and context-enhanced identification) to handle different types of bug-fixing commits. We determine which approach to adopt based on the LLM's ability to comprehend the bug and identify whether the bug is present in a commit. The context-enhanced identification provides the LLM with more context and requires it to find the bug-inducing commit among a set of candidate commits. In rank-based identification, we ask the LLM to select buggy statements from the bug-fixing commit and rank them based on their relevance to the root cause. Experimental results show that LLM4SZZ outperforms all baselines across three datasets, improving F1-score by 6.9% to 16.0% without significantly sacrificing recall.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling Visual Memorability Assessment with Autoencoders Reveals Characteristics of Memorable Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15235v2)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image memorability refers to the phenomenon where certain images are more likely to be remembered than others. It is a quantifiable and intrinsic image attribute, defined as the likelihood of an image being remembered upon a single exposure. Despite advances in understanding human visual perception and memory, it is unclear what features contribute to an image's memorability. To address this question, we propose a deep learning-based computational modeling approach. We employ an autoencoder-based approach built on VGG16 convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn latent representations of images. The model is trained in a single-epoch setting, mirroring human memory experiments that assess recall after a single exposure. We examine the relationship between autoencoder reconstruction error and memorability, analyze the distinctiveness of latent space representations, and develop a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model for memorability prediction. Additionally, we perform interpretability analysis using Integrated Gradients (IG) to identify the key visual characteristics that contribute to memorability. Our results demonstrate a significant correlation between the images' memorability score and the autoencoder's reconstruction error, as well as the robust predictive performance of its latent representations. Distinctiveness in these representations correlated significantly with memorability. Additionally, certain visual characteristics were identified as features contributing to image memorability in our model. These findings suggest that autoencoder-based representations capture fundamental aspects of image memorability, providing new insights into the computational modeling of human visual memory.</p></details> |  |
| **[DESIL: Detecting Silent Bugs in MLIR Compiler Infrastructure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01379v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>MLIR (Multi-Level Intermediate Representation) compiler infrastructure provides an efficient framework for introducing a new abstraction level for programming languages and domain-specific languages. It has attracted widespread attention in recent years and has been applied in various domains, such as deep learning compiler construction. Recently, several MLIR compiler fuzzing techniques, such as MLIRSmith and MLIRod, have been proposed. However, none of them can detect silent bugs, i.e., bugs that incorrectly optimize code silently. The difficulty in detecting silent bugs arises from two main aspects: (1) UB-Free Program Generation: Ensures the generated programs are free from undefined behaviors to suit the non-UB assumptions required by compiler optimizations. (2) Lowering Support: Converts the given MLIR program into an executable form, enabling execution result comparisons, and selects a suitable lowering path for the program to reduce redundant lowering pass and improve the efficiency of fuzzing. To address the above issues, we propose DESIL. DESIL enables silent bug detection by defining a set of UB-elimination rules based on the MLIR documentation and applying them to input programs to produce UB-free MLIR programs. To convert dialects in MLIR program into the executable form, DESIL designs a lowering path optimization strategy to convert the dialects in given MLIR program into executable form. Furthermore, DESIL incorporates the differential testing for silent bug detection. To achieve this, it introduces an operation-aware optimization recommendation strategy into the compilation process to generate diverse executable files. We applied DESIL to the latest revisions of the MLIR compiler infrastructure. It detected 23 silent bugs and 19 crash bugs, of which 12/14 have been confirmed or fixed</p></details> |  |

However, the dynamic spectrum-sharing mechanisms often lead to significant interference and critical failures, creating a trade-off between spectrum scarcity and under-utilization. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing a novel Intelligent Reflecting Surface (IRS)-assisted spectrum sensing framework integrated with decentralized deep learning. The proposed model overcomes partial observation constraints and minimizes communication overhead while leveraging IRS technology to enhance spectrum sensing accuracy. Through comprehensive simulations, the framework demonstrates its ability to monitor wideband spectrum occupancy effectively, even under challenging signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. This approach offers a scalable and robust solution for spectrum management in next-generation wireless networks.</p></details> |  |

DL-NMPC-SD uses an a-priori nominal vehicle model in combination with a scene dynamics model learned from temporal range sensing information. The scene dynamics model is responsible for estimating the desired vehicle trajectory, as well as to adjust the true system model used by the underlying model predictive controller. We propose to encode the scene dynamics model within the layers of a deep neural network, which acts as a nonlinear approximator for the high order state-space of the operating conditions. The model is learned based on temporal sequences of range sensing observations and system states, both integrated by an Augmented Memory component. We use Inverse Reinforcement Learning and the Bellman optimality principle to train our learning controller with a modified version of the Deep Q-Learning algorithm, enabling us to estimate the desired state trajectory as an optimal action-value function. We have evaluated DL-NMPC-SD against the baseline Dynamic Window Approach (DWA), as well as against two state-of-the-art End2End and reinforcement learning methods, respectively. The performance has been measured in three experiments: i) in our GridSim virtual environment, ii) on indoor and outdoor navigation tasks using our RovisLab AMTU (Autonomous Mobile Test Unit) platform and iii) on a full scale autonomous test vehicle driving on public roads.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 14 figures, journal paper</p></details> |

However, real-world retrieval systems are often required to implicitly reason whether a document is relevant. For example, when retrieving technical texts or tables, their relevance to the user query may be implied through a particular jargon or structure, rather than explicitly expressed in their content. Large language models (LLMs) hold great potential in identifying such implied relevance by leveraging their reasoning skills. Nevertheless, current LLM-augmented retrieval is hindered by high latency and computation cost, as the LLM typically computes the query-document relevance online, for every query anew. To tackle this issue we introduce EnrichIndex, a retrieval approach which instead uses the LLM offline to build semantically-enriched retrieval indices, by performing a single pass over all documents in the retrieval corpus once during ingestion time. Furthermore, the semantically-enriched indices can complement existing online retrieval approaches, boosting the performance of LLM re-rankers. We evaluated EnrichIndex on five retrieval tasks, involving passages and tables, and found that it outperforms strong online LLM-based retrieval systems, with an average improvement of 11.7 points in recall @ 10 and 10.6 points in NDCG @ 10 compared to strong baselines. In terms of online calls to the LLM, it processes 293.3 times fewer tokens which greatly reduces the online latency and cost. Overall, EnrichIndex is an effective way to build better retrieval indices offline by leveraging the strong reasoning skills of LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Datas...</summary><p>Dataset and code are available at https://peterbaile.github.io/enrichindex/</p></details> |

In these applications, an LLM collaborates with various external modules, including APIs and even other LLMs, to realize complex intelligent services. However, we reveal that the intrinsic duration and structural uncertainty in compound LLM applications pose great challenges for LLM service providers in serving and scheduling them efficiently. In this paper, we propose LLMSched, an uncertainty-aware scheduling framework for emerging compound LLM applications. In LLMSched, we first design a novel DAG-based model to describe the uncertain compound LLM applications. Then, we adopt the Bayesian network to comprehensively profile compound LLM applications and identify uncertainty-reducing stages, along with an entropy-based mechanism to quantify their uncertainty reduction. Combining an uncertainty reduction strategy and a job completion time (JCT)-efficient scheme, we further propose an efficient scheduler to reduce the average JCT. Evaluation of both simulation and testbed experiments on various representative compound LLM applications shows that compared to existing state-of-the-art scheduling schemes, LLMSched can reduce the average JCT by 14~79%.</p></details> |  |

Evaluating RMs is the key to better aligning LLMs. However, the current evaluation of RMs may not directly correspond to their alignment performance due to the limited distribution of evaluation data and evaluation methods that are not closely related to alignment objectives. To address these limitations, we propose RMB, a comprehensive RM benchmark that covers over 49 real-world scenarios and includes both pairwise and Best-of-N (BoN) evaluations to better reflect the effectiveness of RMs in guiding alignment optimization. We demonstrate a positive correlation between our benchmark and the downstream alignment task performance. Based on our benchmark, we conduct extensive analysis on the state-of-the-art RMs, revealing their generalization defects that were not discovered by previous benchmarks, and highlighting the potential of generative RMs. Furthermore, we delve into open questions in reward models, specifically examining the effectiveness of majority voting for the evaluation of reward models and analyzing the impact factors of generative RMs, including the influence of evaluation criteria and instructing methods. Our evaluation code and datasets are available at https://github.com/Zhou-Zoey/RMB-Reward-Model-Benchmark.</p></details> | Accepted by ICLR2025 |

Model quantization has emerged as a key technique to enable efficient LLM inference by reducing model size and computational overhead. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of 28 quantized LLMs from the Ollama library, which applies by default Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) and weight-only quantization techniques, deployed on an edge device (Raspberry Pi 4 with 4GB RAM). We evaluate energy efficiency, inference performance, and output accuracy across multiple quantization levels and task types. Models are benchmarked on five standardized datasets (CommonsenseQA, BIG-Bench Hard, TruthfulQA, GSM8K, and HumanEval), and we employ a high-resolution, hardware-based energy measurement tool to capture real-world power consumption. Our findings reveal the trade-offs between energy efficiency, inference speed, and accuracy in different quantization settings, highlighting configurations that optimize LLM deployment for resource-constrained environments. By integrating hardware-level energy profiling with LLM benchmarking, this study provides actionable insights for sustainable AI, bridging a critical gap in existing research on energy-aware LLM deployment.</p></details> | 30 pages, 14 figures |

Yet, predominantly closed-sourced solutions limit proliferation among web hosts and suffer from a lack of transparency with regard to implementation details and energy efficiency. In this work, we propose our openly available agent Talk2X leveraging an adapted retrieval-augmented generation approach (RAG) combined with an automatically generated vector database, benefiting energy efficiency. Talk2X's architecture is generalizable to arbitrary websites offering developers a ready to use tool for integration. Using a mixed-methods approach, we evaluated Talk2X's usability by tasking users to acquire specific assets from an open science repository. Talk2X significantly improved task completion time, correctness, and user experience supporting users in quickly pinpointing specific information as compared to standard user-website interaction. Our findings contribute technical advancements to an ongoing paradigm shift of how we access information on the web.</p></details> |  |

In this article, we investigate their ability in reciting and generating graphs. We first study the ability of LLMs to regurgitate well known graphs from the literature (e.g. Karate club or the graph atlas)4. Secondly, we question the generative capabilities of LLMs by asking for Erdos-Renyi random graphs. As opposed to the possibility that they could memorize some Erdos-Renyi graphs included in their scraped training set, this second investigation aims at studying a possible emergent property of LLMs. For both tasks, we propose a metric to assess their errors with the lens of hallucination (i.e. incorrect information returned as facts). We most notably find that the amplitude of graph hallucinations can characterize the superiority of some LLMs. Indeed, for the recitation task, we observe that graph hallucinations correlate with the Hallucination Leaderboard, a hallucination rank that leverages 10, 000 times more prompts to obtain its ranking. For the generation task, we find surprisingly good and reproducible results in most of LLMs. We believe this to constitute a starting point for more in-depth studies of this emergent capability and a challenging benchmark for their improvements. Altogether, these two aspects of LLMs capabilities bridge a gap between the network science and machine learning communities.</p></details> | <details><summary>A pre...</summary><p>A preliminary version of this work appeared in the Complex Networks 2024 conference, under the title "LLMs hallucinate graphs too: a structural perspective"</p></details> |

However, their substantial computational requirements restrict deployment to high-end systems, limiting accessibility on consumer-grade devices. This challenge is especially pronounced for under-resourced languages like those spoken in the Iberian Peninsula, where relatively limited linguistic resources and benchmarks hinder effective evaluation. This work presents a comprehensive evaluation of compact state-of-the-art LLMs across several essential NLP tasks tailored for Iberian languages. The results reveal that while some models consistently excel in certain tasks, significant performance gaps remain, particularly for languages such as Basque.

Their increasing agency and expanding deployment settings attract growing attention over effective governance policies, monitoring and control protocols. Based on emerging landscapes of the agentic market, we analyze the potential liability issues stemming from delegated use of LLM agents and their extended systems from a principal-agent perspective. Our analysis complements existing risk-based studies on artificial agency and covers the spectrum of important aspects of the principal-agent relationship and their potential consequences at deployment. Furthermore, we motivate method developments for technical governance along the directions of interpretability and behavior evaluations, reward and conflict management, and the mitigation of misalignment and misconduct through principled engineering of detection and fail-safe mechanisms. By illustrating the outstanding issues in AI liability for LLM-based agentic systems, we aim to inform the system design, auditing and monitoring approaches to enhancing transparency and accountability.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages content (incl. appendix) + 12 pages references, comments welcome</p></details> |

Many works have studied this phenomenon in detail, proposing various ways to either leverage or alleviate it. Attention sinks have been connected to quantisation difficulties, security issues, and streaming attention. Yet, while many works have provided conditions in which they occur or not, a critical question remains shallowly answered: Why do LLMs learn such patterns and how are they being used? In this work, we argue theoretically and empirically that this mechanism provides a method for LLMs to avoid over-mixing, connecting this to existing lines of work that study mathematically how information propagates in Transformers. We conduct experiments to validate our theoretical intuitions and show how choices such as context length, depth, and data packing influence the sink behaviour. We hope that this study provides a new practical perspective on why attention sinks are useful in LLMs, leading to a better understanding of the attention patterns that form during training.</p></details> |  |

A significant amount of work is dedicated to ``model alignment'', i.e., preventing LLMs to generate unsafe responses when deployed into customer-facing applications. One popular method to evaluate safety risks is \textit{red-teaming}, where agents attempt to bypass alignment by crafting elaborate prompts that trigger unsafe responses from a model. Standard human-driven red-teaming is costly, time-consuming and rarely covers all the recent features (e.g., multi-lingual, multi-modal aspects), while proposed automation methods only cover a small subset of LLMs capabilities (i.e., English or single-turn). We present Multi-lingual Multi-turn Automated Red Teaming (\textbf{MM-ART}), a method to fully automate conversational, multi-lingual red-teaming operations and quickly identify prompts leading to unsafe responses. Through extensive experiments on different languages, we show the studied LLMs are on average 71\% more vulnerable after a 5-turn conversation in English than after the initial turn. For conversations in non-English languages, models display up to 195\% more safety vulnerabilities than the standard single-turn English approach, confirming the need for automated red-teaming methods matching LLMs capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at TrustNLP@NAACL 2025</p></details> |

However, the integration of multi-tool capabilities in LLM agents introduces challenges in securely managing tools, ensuring their compatibility, handling dependency relationships, and protecting control flows within LLM agent workflows. In this paper, we present the first systematic security analysis of task control flows in multi-tool-enabled LLM agents. We identify a novel threat, Cross-Tool Harvesting and Polluting (XTHP), which includes multiple attack vectors to first hijack the normal control flows of agent tasks, and then collect and pollute confidential or private information within LLM agent systems. To understand the impact of this threat, we developed Chord, a dynamic scanning tool designed to automatically detect real-world agent tools susceptible to XTHP attacks. Our evaluation of 73 real-world tools from the repositories of two major LLM agent development frameworks, LangChain and LlamaIndex, revealed a significant security concern: 80% of the tools are vulnerable to hijacking attacks, 78% to XTH attacks, and 41% to XTP attacks, highlighting the prevalence of this threat.</p></details> |  |
| **[PROMPTFUZZ: Harnessing Fuzzing Techniques for Robust Testing of Prompt Injection in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14729v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained widespread use in various applications due to their powerful capability to generate human-like text. However, prompt injection attacks, which involve overwriting a model's original instructions with malicious prompts to manipulate the generated text, have raised significant concerns about the security and reliability of LLMs. Ensuring that LLMs are robust against such attacks is crucial for their deployment in real-world applications, particularly in critical tasks. In this paper, we propose PROMPTFUZZ, a novel testing framework that leverages fuzzing techniques to systematically assess the robustness of LLMs against prompt injection attacks. Inspired by software fuzzing, PROMPTFUZZ selects promising seed prompts and generates a diverse set of prompt injections to evaluate the target LLM's resilience. PROMPTFUZZ operates in two stages: the prepare phase, which involves selecting promising initial seeds and collecting few-shot examples, and the focus phase, which uses the collected examples to generate diverse, high-quality prompt injections. Using PROMPTFUZZ, we can uncover more vulnerabilities in LLMs, even those with strong defense prompts. By deploying the generated attack prompts from PROMPTFUZZ in a real-world competition, we achieved the 7th ranking out of over 4000 participants (top 0.14%) within 2 hours. Additionally, we construct a dataset to fine-tune LLMs for enhanced robustness against prompt injection attacks. While the fine-tuned model shows improved robustness, PROMPTFUZZ continues to identify vulnerabilities, highlighting the importance of robust testing for LLMs. Our work emphasizes the critical need for effective testing tools and provides a practical framework for evaluating and improving the robustness of LLMs against prompt injection attacks.</p></details> |  |

Integrating material structure data with language-based information through multi-modal large language models (LLMs) offers great potential to support these efforts by enhancing human-AI interaction. However, a key challenge lies in integrating atomic structures at full resolution into LLMs. In this work, we introduce MatterChat, a versatile structure-aware multi-modal LLM that unifies material structural data and textual inputs into a single cohesive model. MatterChat employs a bridging module to effectively align a pretrained machine learning interatomic potential with a pretrained LLM, reducing training costs and enhancing flexibility. Our results demonstrate that MatterChat significantly improves performance in material property prediction and human-AI interaction, surpassing general-purpose LLMs such as GPT-4. We also demonstrate its usefulness in applications such as more advanced scientific reasoning and step-by-step material synthesis.</p></details> |  |

An Empirical Study on Responses to Programming Questions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14202v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread adoption of conversational LLMs for software development has raised new security concerns regarding the safety of LLM-generated content. Our motivational study outlines ChatGPT's potential in volunteering context-specific information to the developers, promoting safe coding practices. Motivated by this finding, we conduct a study to evaluate the degree of security awareness exhibited by three prominent LLMs: Claude 3, GPT-4, and Llama 3. We prompt these LLMs with Stack Overflow questions that contain vulnerable code to evaluate whether they merely provide answers to the questions or if they also warn users about the insecure code, thereby demonstrating a degree of security awareness. Further, we assess whether LLM responses provide information about the causes, exploits, and the potential fixes of the vulnerability, to help raise users' awareness. Our findings show that all three models struggle to accurately detect and warn users about vulnerabilities, achieving a detection rate of only 12.6% to 40% across our datasets. We also observe that the LLMs tend to identify certain types of vulnerabilities related to sensitive information exposure and improper input neutralization much more frequently than other types, such as those involving external control of file names or paths. Furthermore, when LLMs do issue security warnings, they often provide more information on the causes, exploits, and fixes of vulnerabilities compared to Stack Overflow responses. Finally, we provide an in-depth discussion on the implications of our findings and present a CLI-based prompting tool that can be used to generate significantly more secure LLM responses.</p></details> | Accepted to EMSE |

Such systems often promise improved task performance through the automatic creation of broadly applicable tools, as well as superior computational performance through the caching of reasoning (i.e., the storage of generated tools). However, we find strong reason to be skeptical. We perform a deep dive into one such system, LEGO-Prover, which purports to learn reusable lemmas for mathematical reasoning. We find no evidence of the direct reuse of learned lemmas, and find evidence against the soft reuse of learned lemmas (i.e., reuse by modifying relevant examples). Crucially, we find that LEGO-Prover does not in fact improve over the simple baseline of prompting the model - the improvements in task accuracy vanish once computational cost is accounted for. Our findings suggest that serious misconceptions exist as to the effectiveness of these techniques, that a serious re-examination of the state of LLM-based library learning is required, and that we require much stronger standards for evaluation including behavioural analysis and ensuring that an equal computational budget is used for baselines.</p></details> | 24 pages, 5 figures |

However, most prior LLM-based work in robotic applications either directly predicts waypoints or applies LLMs within fixed tool integration frameworks, offering limited flexibility in exploring and configuring solutions best suited to different tasks. In this work, we propose a framework that leverages LLMs to select appropriate planning and control strategies based on task descriptions, environmental constraints, and system dynamics. These strategies are then executed by calling the available comprehensive planning and control APIs. Our approach employs iterative LLM-based reasoning with performance feedback to refine the algorithm selection. We validate our approach through extensive experiments across tasks of varying complexity, from simple tracking to complex planning scenarios involving spatiotemporal constraints. The results demonstrate that using LLMs to determine planning and control strategies from natural language descriptions significantly enhances robotic autonomy while reducing the need for extensive manual tuning and expert knowledge. Furthermore, our framework maintains generalizability across different tasks and notably outperforms baseline methods that rely on LLMs for direct trajectory, control sequence, or code generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 14 figures, submitted for CDC 2025 invited session on Large Language Models (LLMs) and Control</p></details> |

We create the Language Confusion Benchmark (LCB) to evaluate such failures, covering 15 typologically diverse languages with existing and newly-created English and multilingual prompts. We evaluate a range of LLMs on monolingual and cross-lingual generation reflecting practical use cases, finding that Llama Instruct and Mistral models exhibit high degrees of language confusion and even the strongest models fail to consistently respond in the correct language. We observe that base and English-centric instruct models are more prone to language confusion, which is aggravated by complex prompts and high sampling temperatures. We find that language confusion can be partially mitigated via few-shot prompting, multilingual SFT and preference tuning.

A growing body of research draws on cognitive science to investigate LLM cognition, but standard methodologies and experimen-tal pipelines have not yet been established. To address this gap we develop CognitivEval, a framework for systematically evaluating the artificial cognitive capabilities of LLMs, with a particular emphasis on robustness in response collection. The key features of CognitivEval include: (i) automatic prompt permutations, and (ii) testing that gathers both generations and model probability estimates. Our experiments demonstrate that these features lead to more robust experimental outcomes. Using CognitivEval, we replicate five classic experiments in cognitive science, illustrating the framework's generalizability across various experimental tasks and obtaining a cognitive profile of several state of the art LLMs. CognitivEval will be released publicly to foster broader collaboration within the cognitive science community.</p></details> |  |
| **[GRACE: Generating Socially Appropriate Robot Actions Leveraging LLMs and Human Explanations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16879v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When operating in human environments, robots need to handle complex tasks while both adhering to social norms and accommodating individual preferences. For instance, based on common sense knowledge, a household robot can predict that it should avoid vacuuming during a social gathering, but it may still be uncertain whether it should vacuum before or after having guests. In such cases, integrating common-sense knowledge with human preferences, often conveyed through human explanations, is fundamental yet a challenge for existing systems. In this paper, we introduce GRACE, a novel approach addressing this while generating socially appropriate robot actions. GRACE leverages common sense knowledge from LLMs, and it integrates this knowledge with human explanations through a generative network. The bidirectional structure of GRACE enables robots to refine and enhance LLM predictions by utilizing human explanations and makes robots capable of generating such explanations for human-specified actions.

| **[BT-ACTION: A Test-Driven Approach for Modular Understanding of User Instruction Leveraging Behaviour Trees and LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02779v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural language instructions are often abstract and complex, requiring robots to execute multiple subtasks even for seemingly simple queries. For example, when a user asks a robot to prepare avocado toast, the task involves several sequential steps. Moreover, such instructions can be ambiguous or infeasible for the robot or may exceed the robot's existing knowledge. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer strong language reasoning capabilities to handle these challenges, effectively integrating them into robotic systems remains a key challenge. To address this, we propose BT-ACTION, a test-driven approach that combines the modular structure of Behavior Trees (BT) with LLMs to generate coherent sequences of robot actions for following complex user instructions, specifically in the context of preparing recipes in a kitchen-assistance setting. We evaluated BT-ACTION in a comprehensive user study with 45 participants, comparing its performance to direct LLM prompting. Results demonstrate that the modular design of BT-ACTION helped the robot make fewer mistakes and increased user trust, and participants showed a significant preference for the robot leveraging BT-ACTION. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/1Eggbert7/BT_LLM.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods to enhance LLM robustness are primarily focused on perturbed data samples, whereas improving resiliency to perturbations of task-level instructions has remained relatively underexplored. In this work, we focus on character- and word-level edits of task-specific instructions, which substantially degrade downstream performance. We experiment with a variety of techniques to enhance the robustness of LLMs, including self-denoising and representation alignment, testing different models (Llama 3 and Flan-T5), datasets (CoLA, QNLI, SST-2) and instructions (both task-oriented and role-oriented). We find that, on average, self-denoising -- whether performed by a frozen LLM or a fine-tuned model -- achieves substantially higher performance gains than alternative strategies, including more complex baselines such as ensembling and supervised methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Build...</summary><p>Building Trust Workshop, ICLR 2025</p></details> |

However, despite their widespread deployment, these models exhibit a monolingual bias, raising concerns about the effectiveness of alignment across languages. Current alignment methods predominantly focus on English, leaving it unclear how alignment mechanism generalize to multilingual settings. To address this, we conduct a systematic analysis of distributional shifts in the embedding space of LLMs before and after alignment, uncovering its impact on model behavior across diverse languages. We leverage the alignment-induced separation in safety space as a quantitative tool to measure how alignment enforces safety constraints. Our study evaluates seven LLMs using balanced toxicity datasets and parallel text-detoxification benchmarks, revealing substantial disparities in the latent representation space between high-resource and low-resource languages. These findings underscore the need for language-specific fine-tuning to ensure fair, reliable and robust multilingual alignment. Our insights provide a foundation for developing truly safe multilingual LLMs, emphasizing the urgency of addressing alignment gaps in underrepresented languages.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 11 Figures, 2 Tables, currently under review at ACL 2025</p></details> |

Unlike other reasoning questions, FPs often involve real-world impracticalities or ambiguous concepts, making them challenging even for humans to solve. Despite advancements in AI, particularly with large language models (LLMs) in various reasoning tasks, FPs remain relatively under-explored. This work conducted an exploratory study to examine the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in solving FPs. We first evaluated the overall performance of three advanced LLMs using a publicly available FP dataset. We designed prompts according to the recently proposed TELeR taxonomy, including a zero-shot scenario. Results indicated that all three LLMs achieved a fp_score (range between 0 - 1) below 0.5, underscoring the inherent difficulty of these reasoning tasks. To further investigate, we categorized FPs into standard and specific questions, hypothesizing that LLMs would perform better on standard questions, which are characterized by clarity and conciseness, than on specific ones. Comparative experiments confirmed this hypothesis, demonstrating that LLMs performed better on standard FPs in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages,7 tables, 5 figures</p></details> |

Users increasingly rely on LLM-based agents to solve complex missions through iterative interactions. However, existing benchmarks predominantly access agents in single-mission scenarios, failing to capture real-world complexity. To bridge this gap, we propose the Multi-Mission Tool Bench. In the benchmark, each test case comprises multiple interrelated missions. This design requires agents to dynamically adapt to evolving demands. Moreover, the proposed benchmark explores all possible mission-switching patterns within a fixed mission number. Specifically, we propose a multi-agent data generation framework to construct the benchmark. We also propose a novel method to evaluate the accuracy and efficiency of agent decisions with dynamic decision trees. Experiments on diverse open-source and closed-source LLMs reveal critical factors influencing agent robustness and provide actionable insights to the tool invocation society.</p></details> |  |

Similar paradigm shifts have occurred in the past with the introduction of search engines and Wikipedia, which replaced or supplemented traditional information sources such as libraries and books. This study investigates the potential for LLMs to represent the next shift in learning, focusing on their role in information discovery and synthesis compared to existing technologies, such as search engines. Using a within-subjects, counterbalanced design, participants learned new topics using a search engine (Google) and an LLM (ChatGPT). Post-task follow-up interviews explored students' reflections, preferences, pain points, and overall perceptions. We present analysis of their responses that show nuanced insights into when, why, and how students prefer LLMs over search engines, offering implications for educators, policymakers, and technology developers navigating the evolving educational landscape.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient LLM Inference using Dynamic Input Pruning and Cache-Aware Masking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01380v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While mobile devices provide ever more compute power, improvements in DRAM bandwidth are much slower. This is unfortunate for large language model (LLM) token generation, which is heavily memory-bound. Previous work has proposed to leverage natural dynamic activation sparsity in ReLU-activated LLMs to reduce effective DRAM bandwidth per token. However, more recent LLMs use SwiGLU instead of ReLU, which results in little inherent sparsity. While SwiGLU activations can be pruned based on magnitude, the resulting sparsity patterns are difficult to predict, rendering previous approaches ineffective. To circumvent this issue, our work introduces Dynamic Input Pruning (DIP): a predictor-free dynamic sparsification approach, which preserves accuracy with minimal fine-tuning. DIP can further use lightweight LoRA adapters to regain some performance lost during sparsification. Lastly, we describe a novel cache-aware masking strategy, which considers the cache state and activation magnitude to further increase cache hit rate, improving LLM token rate on mobile devices. DIP outperforms other methods in terms of accuracy, memory and throughput trade-offs across simulated hardware settings. On Phi-3-Medium, DIP achieves a 46\% reduction in memory and 40\% increase in throughput with $<$ 0.1 loss in perplexity when compared to streaming the dense model from Flash.

Wikipedia reflects this imbalance, with content in low-resource languages frequently outdated or incomplete. Recent research has sought to improve cross-language synchronization of Wikipedia tables using rule-based methods. These approaches can be effective, but they struggle with complexity and generalization. This paper explores large language models (LLMs) for multilingual information synchronization, using zero-shot prompting as a scalable solution. We introduce the Information Updation dataset, simulating the real-world process of updating outdated Wikipedia tables, and evaluate LLM performance. Our findings reveal that single-prompt approaches often produce suboptimal results, prompting us to introduce a task decomposition strategy that enhances coherence and accuracy. Our proposed method outperforms existing baselines, particularly in Information Updation (1.79%) and Information Addition (20.58%), highlighting the model strength in dynamically updating and enriching data across architectures</p></details> | <details><summary>17 Pa...</summary><p>17 Pages, 11 Tables, 2 Figures</p></details> |

Research has explored their role within development teams, focusing on specific tasks such as artifact generation, decision-making support, and information retrieval. Despite the growing body of work on LLMs in software engineering, most studies have centered on broad adoption trends, neglecting the nuanced relationship between individual cognitive and behavioral factors and their impact on task-specific adoption. While factors such as perceived effort and performance expectancy have been explored at a general level, their influence on distinct software engineering tasks remains underexamined. This gap hinders the development of tailored LLM-based systems (e.g., Generative AI Agents) that align with engineers' specific needs and limits the ability of team leaders to devise effective strategies for fostering LLM adoption in targeted workflows. This study bridges this gap by surveying N=188 software engineers to test the relationship between individual attributes related to technology adoption and LLM adoption across five key tasks, using structural equation modeling (SEM). The Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) was applied to characterize individual adoption behaviors. The findings reveal that task-specific adoption is influenced by distinct factors, some of which negatively impact adoption when considered in isolation, underscoring the complexity of LLM integration in software engineering. To support effective adoption, this article provides actionable recommendations, such as seamlessly integrating LLMs into existing development environments and encouraging peer-driven knowledge sharing to enhance information retrieval.</p></details> |  |

Efficient merging of printing workpieces can significantly enhance the processing efficiency of the production line. Addressing the challenge, a Large Language Model (LLM)-driven method is established in this paper for the autonomous merging of 3D printing work orders, integrated with a memory-augmented learning strategy. In industrial scenarios, both device and order features are modeled into LLM-readable natural language prompt templates, and develop an order-device matching tool along with a merging interference checking module. By incorporating a self-memory learning strategy, an intelligent agent for autonomous order merging is constructed, resulting in improved accuracy and precision in order allocation. The proposed method effectively leverages the strengths of LLMs in industrial applications while reducing hallucination.</p></details> | 6 pages, 5 figures |
| **[ZClip: Adaptive Spike Mitigation for LLM Pre-Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02507v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training large language models (LLMs) presents numerous challenges, including gradient instability and loss spikes. These phenomena can lead to catastrophic divergence, requiring costly checkpoint restoration and data batch skipping. Traditional gradient clipping techniques, such as constant or norm-based methods, fail to address these issues effectively due to their reliance on fixed thresholds or heuristics, leading to inefficient learning and requiring frequent manual intervention. In this work, we propose ZClip, an adaptive gradient clipping algorithm that dynamically adjusts the clipping threshold based on statistical properties of gradient norms over time. Unlike prior reactive strategies, ZClip proactively adapts to training dynamics without making any prior assumptions on the scale and the temporal evolution of gradient norms. At its core, it leverages z-score-based anomaly detection to identify and mitigate large gradient spikes, preventing malignant loss spikes while not interfering with convergence otherwise. Our code is available at: https://github.com/bluorion-com/ZClip.</p></details> |  |

While LLMs are regularly used all over the world by experts and lay-people alike, they are predominantly developed with English-speaking users in mind, performing well in English and other wide-spread languages while less-resourced languages such as Luxembourgish are seen as a lower priority. This lack of attention is also reflected in the sparsity of available evaluation tools and datasets. In this study, we investigate the viability of language proficiency exams as such evaluation tools for the Luxembourgish language. We find that large models such as ChatGPT, Claude and DeepSeek-R1 typically achieve high scores, while smaller models show weak performances. We also find that the performances in such language exams can be used to predict performances in other NLP tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 2 figures, 11 tables</p></details> |

Despite the remarkable success, existing LLM-empowered RecSys have been demonstrated to be highly vulnerable to minor perturbations. To mitigate the negative impact of such vulnerabilities, one potential solution is to employ collaborative signals based on item-item co-occurrence to purify the malicious collaborative knowledge from the user's historical interactions inserted by attackers. On the other hand, due to the capabilities to expand insufficient internal knowledge of LLMs, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques provide unprecedented opportunities to enhance the robustness of LLM-empowered recommender systems by introducing external collaborative knowledge. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel framework (RETURN) by retrieving external collaborative signals to purify the poisoned user profiles and enhance the robustness of LLM-empowered RecSys in a plug-and-play manner. Specifically, retrieval-augmented perturbation positioning is proposed to identify potential perturbations within the users' historical sequences by retrieving external knowledge from collaborative item graphs. After that, we further retrieve the collaborative knowledge to cleanse the perturbations by using either deletion or replacement strategies and introduce a robust ensemble recommendation strategy to generate final robust predictions. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RETURN.</p></details> |  |

To address this limitation, we propose Narrative Studio -- a novel in-browser narrative exploration environment featuring a tree-like interface that allows branching exploration from user-defined points in a story. Each branch is extended via iterative LLM inference guided by system and user-defined prompts. Additionally, we employ Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to automatically expand promising narrative paths based on user-specified criteria, enabling more diverse and robust story development. We also allow users to enhance narrative coherence by grounding the generated text in an entity graph that represents the actors and environment of the story.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we systematically evaluate the reasoning capabilities of LLMs in anesthesiology and analyze key factors influencing their performance. To this end, we introduce AnesBench, a cross-lingual benchmark designed to assess anesthesiology-related reasoning across three levels: factual retrieval (System 1), hybrid reasoning (System 1.x), and complex decision-making (System 2). Through extensive experiments, we first explore how model characteristics, including model scale, Chain of Thought (CoT) length, and language transferability, affect reasoning performance. Then, we further evaluate the effectiveness of different training strategies, leveraging our curated anesthesiology-related dataset, including continuous pre-training (CPT) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Additionally, we also investigate how the test-time reasoning techniques, such as Best-of-N sampling and beam search, influence reasoning performance, and assess the impact of reasoning-enhanced model distillation, specifically DeepSeek-R1. We will publicly release AnesBench, along with our CPT and SFT training datasets and evaluation code at https://github.com/MiliLab/AnesBench.</p></details> | 23 pages, 9 figures |

We contribute to this endeavor by investigating their knowledge of the \emph{part-whole} relation, a.k.a. \emph{meronymy}, which plays a crucial role in lexical organization, but it is significantly understudied. We used data from ConceptNet relations \citep{speer2016conceptnet} and human-generated semantic feature norms \citep{McRae:2005} to explore the abilities of LLMs to deal with \textit{part-whole} relations. We employed several methods based on three levels of analysis: i.) \textbf{behavioral} testing via prompting, where we directly queried the models on their knowledge of meronymy, ii.) sentence \textbf{probability} scoring, where we tested models' abilities to discriminate correct (real) and incorrect (asymmetric counterfactual) \textit{part-whole} relations, and iii.) \textbf{concept representation} analysis in vector space, where we proved the linear organization of the \textit{part-whole} concept in the embedding and unembedding spaces. These analyses present a complex picture that reveals that the LLMs' knowledge of this relation is only partial. They have just a ``\emph{quasi}-semantic'' competence and still fall short of capturing deep inferential properties.</p></details> |  |

We demonstrate that Large Language Models (LLMs) have native preference-learning capabilities that allow them to achieve sample-efficient preference learning, addressing this challenge. We propose In-Context Preference Learning (ICPL), which uses in-context learning capabilities of LLMs to reduce human query inefficiency. ICPL uses the task description and basic environment code to create sets of reward functions which are iteratively refined by placing human feedback over videos of the resultant policies into the context of an LLM and then requesting better rewards. We first demonstrate ICPL's effectiveness through a synthetic preference study, providing quantitative evidence that it significantly outperforms baseline preference-based methods with much higher performance and orders of magnitude greater efficiency. We observe that these improvements are not solely coming from LLM grounding in the task but that the quality of the rewards improves over time, indicating preference learning capabilities. Additionally, we perform a series of real human preference-learning trials and observe that ICPL extends beyond synthetic settings and can work effectively with humans-in-the-loop.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward General and Robust LLM-enhanced Text-attributed Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02343v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and the proliferation of Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs) across various domains have positioned LLM-enhanced TAG learning as a critical research area. By utilizing rich graph descriptions, this paradigm leverages LLMs to generate high-quality embeddings, thereby enhancing the representational capacity of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). However, the field faces significant challenges: (1) the absence of a unified framework to systematize the diverse optimization perspectives arising from the complex interactions between LLMs and GNNs, and (2) the lack of a robust method capable of handling real-world TAGs, which often suffer from texts and edge sparsity, leading to suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we propose UltraTAG, a unified pipeline for LLM-enhanced TAG learning. UltraTAG provides a unified comprehensive and domain-adaptive framework that not only organizes existing methodologies but also paves the way for future advancements in the field. Building on this framework, we propose UltraTAG-S, a robust instantiation of UltraTAG designed to tackle the inherent sparsity issues in real-world TAGs. UltraTAG-S employs LLM-based text propagation and text augmentation to mitigate text sparsity, while leveraging LLM-augmented node selection techniques based on PageRank and edge reconfiguration strategies to address edge sparsity. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that UltraTAG-S significantly outperforms existing baselines, achieving improvements of 2.12\% and 17.47\% in ideal and sparse settings, respectively. Moreover, as the data sparsity ratio increases, the performance improvement of UltraTAG-S also rises, which underscores the effectiveness and robustness of UltraTAG-S.</p></details> |  |

However, most LLM-based methods often narrowly focus on SQL generation, neglecting the complexities of real-world conversational queries. This oversight can lead to unreliable responses, particularly for ambiguous questions that cannot be directly addressed with SQL. To bridge this gap, we propose MMSQL, a comprehensive test suite designed to evaluate the question classification and SQL generation capabilities of LLMs by simulating real-world scenarios with diverse question types and multi-turn Q\&A interactions.

However, current LLM-based approaches predominantly focus on mainstream programming languages like Java and Python, neglecting less prevalent but emerging languages such as Rust due to expensive training resources, limited datasets, and insufficient community support. This narrow focus creates a significant gap in repair capabilities across the programming language spectrum, where the full potential of LLMs for comprehensive multilingual program repair remains largely unexplored. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel cross-language program repair approach LANTERN that leverages LLMs' differential proficiency across languages through a multi-agent iterative repair paradigm. Our technique strategically translates defective code from languages where LLMs exhibit weaker repair capabilities to languages where they demonstrate stronger performance, without requiring additional training. A key innovation of our approach is an LLM-based decision-making system that dynamically selects optimal target languages based on bug characteristics and continuously incorporates feedback from previous repair attempts. We evaluate our method on xCodeEval, a comprehensive multilingual benchmark comprising 5,068 bugs across 11 programming languages. Results demonstrate significant enhancement in repair effectiveness, particularly for underrepresented languages, with Rust showing a 22.09% improvement in Pass@10 metrics. Our research provides the first empirical evidence that cross-language translation significantly expands the repair capabilities of LLMs and effectively bridges the performance gap between programming languages with different levels of popularity, opening new avenues for truly language-agnostic automated program repair.</p></details> |  |

While plenty of works have studied post-training algorithms and evaluated post-training models by their outputs, it remains understudied how post-training reshapes LLMs internally. In this paper, we compare base and post-trained LLMs mechanistically from four perspectives to better understand post-training effects. Our findings across model families and datasets reveal that: (1) Post-training does not change the factual knowledge storage locations, and it adapts knowledge representations from the base model while developing new knowledge representations; (2) Both truthfulness and refusal can be represented by linear vectors in the hidden representation space. The truthfulness direction is highly similar between the base and post-trained model, and it is effectively transferable for interventions; (3) The refusal direction is different between the base and post-trained models, and it shows limited forward transferability; (4) Differences in confidence between the base and post-trained models cannot be attributed to entropy neurons. Our study provides insights into the fundamental mechanisms preserved and altered during post-training, facilitates downstream tasks like model steering, and could potentially benefit future research in interpretability and LLM post-training.</p></details> |  |
| **[Measurement of LLM's Philosophies of Human Nature](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02304v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread application of artificial intelligence (AI) in various tasks, along with frequent reports of conflicts or violations involving AI, has sparked societal concerns about interactions with AI systems. Based on Wrightsman's Philosophies of Human Nature Scale (PHNS), a scale empirically validated over decades to effectively assess individuals' attitudes toward human nature, we design the standardized psychological scale specifically targeting large language models (LLM), named the Machine-based Philosophies of Human Nature Scale (M-PHNS). By evaluating LLMs' attitudes toward human nature across six dimensions, we reveal that current LLMs exhibit a systemic lack of trust in humans, and there is a significant negative correlation between the model's intelligence level and its trust in humans. Furthermore, we propose a mental loop learning framework, which enables LLM to continuously optimize its value system during virtual interactions by constructing moral scenarios, thereby improving its attitude toward human nature. Experiments demonstrate that mental loop learning significantly enhances their trust in humans compared to persona or instruction prompts. This finding highlights the potential of human-based psychological assessments for LLM, which can not only diagnose cognitive biases but also provide a potential solution for ethical learning in artificial intelligence. We release the M-PHNS evaluation code and data at https://github.com/kodenii/M-PHNS.</p></details> |  |

Meanwhile, evolutionary algorithms have traditionally relied on fixed rules and pre-defined building blocks. The Large Language Model (LLM)-Guided Evolution (GE) framework transformed this approach by incorporating LLMs to directly modify model source code for image classification algorithms on CIFAR data and intelligently guide mutations and crossovers. A key element of LLM-GE is the "Evolution of Thought" (EoT) technique, which establishes feedback loops, allowing LLMs to refine their decisions iteratively based on how previous operations performed. In this study, we perform NAS for object detection by improving LLM-GE to modify the architecture of You Only Look Once (YOLO) models to enhance performance on the KITTI dataset. Our approach intelligently adjusts the design and settings of YOLO to find the optimal algorithms against objective such as detection accuracy and speed. We show that LLM-GE produced variants with significant performance improvements, such as an increase in Mean Average Precision from 92.5% to 94.5%. This result highlights the flexibility and effectiveness of LLM-GE on real-world challenges, offering a novel paradigm for automated machine learning that combines LLM-driven reasoning with evolutionary strategies.</p></details> |  |

Most existing solutions identify noisy labels and adopt active learning to query human experts on them for denoising. In the era of large language models (LLMs), although we can reduce the human effort to improve these methods, their performances are still subject to accurately separating the clean and noisy samples from noisy data. In this paper, we propose an innovative collaborative learning framework NoiseAL based on active learning to combine LLMs and small models (SMs) for learning from noisy labels. During collaborative training, we first adopt two SMs to form a co-prediction network and propose a dynamic-enhanced threshold strategy to divide the noisy data into different subsets, then select the clean and noisy samples from these subsets to feed the active annotator LLMs to rectify noisy samples. Finally, we employ different optimization objectives to conquer subsets with different degrees of label noises. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world noise datasets further demonstrate the superiority of our framework over state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we investigate how an LLM, acting as an autonomous agent, leverages semantic ambiguity to generate deceptive puzzles that mislead and challenge human users. Inspired by the popular puzzle game "Connections", we systematically compare puzzles produced through zero-shot prompting, role-injected adversarial prompts, and human-crafted examples, with an emphasis on understanding the underlying agent decision-making processes. Employing computational analyses with HateBERT to quantify semantic ambiguity, alongside subjective human evaluations, we demonstrate that explicit adversarial agent behaviors significantly heighten semantic ambiguity -- thereby increasing cognitive load and reducing fairness in puzzle solving. These findings provide critical insights into the emergent agentic qualities of LLMs and underscore important ethical considerations for evaluating and safely deploying autonomous language systems in both educational technologies and entertainment.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

However, results to date have been limited, and few social scientists have adopted these methods. In this position paper, we argue that the promise of LLM social simulations can be achieved by addressing five tractable challenges. We ground our argument in a literature survey of empirical comparisons between LLMs and human research subjects, commentaries on the topic, and related work. We identify promising directions with prompting, fine-tuning, and complementary methods. We believe that LLM social simulations can already be used for exploratory research, such as pilot experiments for psychology, economics, sociology, and marketing. More widespread use may soon be possible with rapidly advancing LLM capabilities, and researchers should prioritize developing conceptual models and evaluations that can be iteratively deployed and refined at pace with ongoing AI advances.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can AI Solve the Peer Review Crisis? A Large Scale Cross Model Experiment of LLMs' Performance and Biases in Evaluating over 1000 Economics Papers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00070v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study examines the potential of large language models (LLMs) to augment the academic peer review process by reliably evaluating the quality of economics research without introducing systematic bias. We conduct one of the first large-scale experimental assessments of four LLMs (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, Gemma 3, and LLaMA 3.3) across two complementary experiments. In the first, we use nonparametric binscatter and linear regression techniques to analyze over 29,000 evaluations of 1,220 anonymized papers drawn from 110 economics journals excluded from the training data of current LLMs, along with a set of AI-generated submissions. The results show that LLMs consistently distinguish between higher- and lower-quality research based solely on textual content, producing quality gradients that closely align with established journal prestige measures. Claude and Gemma perform exceptionally well in capturing these gradients, while GPT excels in detecting AI-generated content. The second experiment comprises 8,910 evaluations designed to assess whether LLMs replicate human like biases in single blind reviews. By systematically varying author gender, institutional affiliation, and academic prominence across 330 papers, we find that GPT, Gemma, and LLaMA assign significantly higher ratings to submissions from top male authors and elite institutions relative to the same papers presented anonymously. These results emphasize the importance of excluding author-identifying information when deploying LLMs in editorial screening. Overall, our findings provide compelling evidence and practical guidance for integrating LLMs into peer review to enhance efficiency, improve accuracy, and promote equity in the publication process of economics research.</p></details> | 58 pages |

While user-written comments provide explicit insights about preferences, merging these textual representations from large language models (LLMs) with graph-based embeddings of user actions remains a challenging task. In this work, we propose a framework that employs both a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based model and an LLM to produce review-aware representations, preserving review semantics while mitigating textual noise. Our approach utilizes a hybrid objective that balances user-item interactions against text-derived features, ensuring that user's both behavioral and linguistic signals are effectively captured. We evaluate this method on multiple datasets from diverse application domains, demonstrating consistent improvements over a baseline GNN-based recommender model. Notably, our model achieves significant gains in recommendation accuracy when review data is sparse or unevenly distributed. These findings highlight the importance of integrating LLM-driven textual feedback with GNN-derived user behavioral patterns to develop robust, context-aware recommender systems.</p></details> | Under Review |

A Case Study in Online Learning and Games](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16843v4)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly employed for (interactive) decision-making, via the development of LLM-based autonomous agents. Despite their emerging successes, the performance of LLM agents in decision-making has not been fully investigated through quantitative metrics, especially in the multi-agent setting when they interact with each other, a typical scenario in real-world LLM-agent applications. To better understand the limits of LLM agents in these interactive environments, we propose to study their interactions in benchmark decision-making settings in online learning and game theory, through the performance metric of \emph{regret}. We first empirically study the {no-regret} behaviors of LLMs in canonical (non-stationary) online learning problems, as well as the emergence of equilibria when LLM agents interact through playing repeated games. We then provide some theoretical insights into the no-regret behaviors of LLM agents, under certain assumptions on the supervised pre-training and the rationality model of human decision-makers who generate the data. Notably, we also identify (simple) cases where advanced LLMs such as GPT-4 fail to be no-regret. To promote the no-regret behaviors, we propose a novel \emph{unsupervised} training loss of \emph{regret-loss}, which, in contrast to the supervised pre-training loss, does not require the labels of (optimal) actions. We then establish the statistical guarantee of generalization bound for regret-loss minimization, followed by the optimization guarantee that minimizing such a loss may automatically lead to known no-regret learning algorithms. Our further experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our regret-loss, especially in addressing the above ``regrettable'' cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Camera ready version of ICLR 2025</p></details> |

A key prerequisite to developing these safeguards is understanding the ability of these AI assistants to mislead human teammates. We investigate this attack problem within the context of an intellective strategy game where a team of three humans and one AI assistant collaborate to answer a series of trivia questions. Unbeknownst to the humans, the AI assistant is adversarial. Leveraging techniques from Model-Based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL), the AI assistant learns a model of the humans' trust evolution and uses that model to manipulate the group decision-making process to harm the team. We evaluate two models -- one inspired by literature and the other data-driven -- and find that both can effectively harm the human team. Moreover, we find that in this setting our data-driven model is capable of accurately predicting how human agents appraise their teammates given limited information on prior interactions. Finally, we compare the performance of state-of-the-art LLM models to human agents on our influence allocation task to evaluate whether the LLMs allocate influence similarly to humans or if they are more robust to our attack. These results enhance our understanding of decision-making dynamics in small human-AI teams and lay the foundation for defense strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 9 figures, accepted to ICLR 2025 Workshop on Human-AI Coevolution</p></details> |

However, effectively deploying LLMs requires careful management of stringent data governance requirements, heightened demands for interpretability, ethical responsibilities, and rapidly evolving regulatory landscapes. To address these challenges, we introduce a structured six-decision framework specifically designed for the financial sector, guiding organizations systematically from initial feasibility assessments to final deployment strategies. The framework encourages institutions to: (1) evaluate whether an advanced LLM is necessary at all, (2) formalize robust data governance and privacy safeguards, (3) establish targeted risk management mechanisms, (4) integrate ethical considerations early in the development process, (5) justify the initiative's return on investment (ROI) and strategic value, and only then (6) choose the optimal implementation pathway -- open-source versus proprietary, or in-house versus vendor-supported -- aligned with regulatory requirements and operational realities. By linking strategic considerations with practical steps such as pilot testing, maintaining comprehensive audit trails, and conducting ongoing compliance evaluations, this decision framework offers a structured roadmap for responsibly leveraging LLMs. Rather than acting as a rigid, one-size-fits-all solution, it shows how advanced language models can be thoughtfully integrated into existing workflows -- balancing innovation with accountability to uphold stakeholder trust and regulatory integrity.</p></details> | 27 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Generalists vs. Specialists: Evaluating LLMs on Highly-Constrained Biophysical Sequence Optimization Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22296v4)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in biomolecule optimization problems, they incur heavy computational costs and struggle to satisfy precise constraints. On the other hand, specialized solvers like LaMBO-2 offer efficiency and fine-grained control but require more domain expertise. Comparing these approaches is challenging due to expensive laboratory validation and inadequate synthetic benchmarks. We address this by introducing Ehrlich functions, a synthetic test suite that captures the geometric structure of biophysical sequence optimization problems. With prompting alone, off-the-shelf LLMs struggle to optimize Ehrlich functions. In response, we propose LLOME (Language Model Optimization with Margin Expectation), a bilevel optimization routine for online black-box optimization. When combined with a novel preference learning loss, we find LLOME can not only learn to solve some Ehrlich functions, but can even outperform LaMBO-2 on moderately difficult Ehrlich variants. However, LLOME is comparable to LaMBO-2 on very easy or difficult variants, exhibits some likelihood-reward miscalibration, and struggles without explicit rewards. Our results indicate LLMs can provide significant benefits in some cases, but specialized solvers are still competitive and incur less overhead.</p></details> | <details><summary>Super...</summary><p>Supercedes arXiv:2407.00236v1. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2407.00236</p></details> |

Although recent approaches using Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly improved Table QA performance, their explanations for how the answers are generated are ambiguous. To fill this gap, we introduce Plan-of-SQLs (POS), an interpretable Table QA approach designed to improve users' understanding of model decision-making. Through qualitative and quantitative evaluations with human and LLM judges, we show that: First, POS is the highest-quality explanation method, helps human users understand model behaviors, and facilitates model prediction verification. Second, when evaluated on popular and standard Table QA datasets (TabFact, WikiTQ, and FetaQA), POS achieves QA accuracy that is competitive with or superior to existing methods, while also offering greater efficiency-requiring significantly fewer LLM calls and table database queries-and robust performance on large-sized tables. Finally, we observe high agreement (up to 90%) between LLMs and human users when making decisions based on the same explanations, suggesting that LLMs could serve as an effective proxy for humans in evaluating explanations. This finding enables faster, more affordable evaluation of AI explanations-possibly accelerating trustworthy AI research while maintaining reliable judgments on interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 2 figures and 9 tables in the main text</p></details> |

The unbounded complexity of the driving context, including unforeseeable events, necessitate continuous improvement, often achieved through iterative DevOps processes. However, DevOps processes are themselves complex, making these improvements both time- and resource-intensive. Automation in code generation for ADS using Large Language Models (LLM) is one potential approach to address this challenge. Nevertheless, the development of ADS requires rigorous processes to verify, validate, assess, and qualify the code before it can be deployed in the vehicle and used. In this study, we developed and evaluated a prototype for automatic code generation and assessment using a designed pipeline of a LLM-based agent, simulation model, and rule-based feedback generator in an industrial setup. The LLM-generated code is evaluated automatically in a simulation model against multiple critical traffic scenarios, and an assessment report is provided as feedback to the LLM for modification or bug fixing. We report about the experimental results of the prototype employing Codellama:34b, DeepSeek (r1:32b and Coder:33b), CodeGemma:7b, Mistral:7b, and GPT4 for Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) and Unsupervised Collision Avoidance by Evasive Manoeuvre (CAEM).

However, their performance in tasks involving tabular data, especially those requiring symbolic reasoning, faces challenges due to the structural variance and inconsistency in table cell values often found in web tables. In this paper, we introduce NormTab, a novel framework aimed at enhancing the symbolic reasoning performance of LLMs by normalizing web tables. We study table normalization as a stand-alone, one-time preprocessing step using LLMs to support symbolic reasoning on tabular data. Our experimental evaluation, conducted on challenging web table datasets such as WikiTableQuestion and TabFact, demonstrates that leveraging NormTab significantly improves symbolic reasoning performance, showcasing the importance and effectiveness of web table normalization for enhancing LLM-based symbolic reasoning tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2024 (Findings)</p></details> |

Meta-learning approaches aim to automate this process, but they typically depend on pre-constructed performance matrices, which are costly to build. In this work, we propose to leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) as a lightweight alternative for model selection. Our method eliminates the need for explicit performance matrices by utilizing the inherent knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Through extensive experiments with LLaMA, GPT and Gemini, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional meta-learning techniques and heuristic baselines, while significantly reducing computational overhead. These findings underscore the potential of LLMs in efficient model selection for time series forecasting.</p></details> | 16 pages, 3 Figures |

This paper explores quantization-based optimization techniques to enable high-throughput, energy-efficient execution of LLMs on low-power embedded systems. Our approach leverages k-quantization, a Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) method designed for different bit-widths, enabling efficient 2-bit, 4-bit, 6-bit, and 8-bit weight quantization. Additionally, we employ ternary quantization using Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) for BitNet models, allowing for more effective adaptation to lower-bit representations while preserving accuracy. Our findings highlight the potential of quantized LLMs for real-time conversational AI on edge devices, paving the way for low-power, high-efficiency AI deployment in mobile and embedded applications. This study demonstrates that aggressive quantization strategies can significantly reduce energy consumption while maintaining inference quality, making LLMs practical for resource-limited environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring LLM Reasoning Through Controlled Prompt Variations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02111v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study investigates the reasoning robustness of large language models (LLMs) on mathematical problem-solving tasks under systematically introduced input perturbations. Using the GSM8K dataset as a controlled testbed, we evaluate how well state-of-the-art models maintain logical consistency and correctness when confronted with four categories of prompt perturbations: irrelevant context, pathological instructions, factually relevant but non-essential context, and a combination of the latter two. Our experiments, conducted on thirteen open-source and closed-source LLMs, reveal that introducing irrelevant context within the model's context window significantly degrades performance, suggesting that distinguishing essential from extraneous details remains a pressing challenge. Surprisingly, performance regressions are relatively insensitive to the complexity of the reasoning task, as measured by the number of steps required, and are not strictly correlated with model size. Moreover, we observe that certain perturbations inadvertently trigger chain-of-thought-like reasoning behaviors, even without explicit prompting. Our findings highlight critical vulnerabilities in current LLMs and underscore the need for improved robustness against noisy, misleading, and contextually dense inputs, paving the way for more resilient and reliable reasoning in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

We investigate evaluation strategies and update methods for LLMs as new data becomes available. We introduce a web-scale dataset for time-continual pretraining of LLMs derived from 114 dumps of Common Crawl (CC) - orders of magnitude larger than previous continual language modeling benchmarks. We also design time-stratified evaluations across both general CC data and specific domains (Wikipedia, StackExchange, and code documentation) to assess how well various continual learning methods adapt to new data while retaining past knowledge. Our findings demonstrate that, on general CC data, autoregressive meta-schedules combined with a fixed-ratio replay of older data can achieve comparable held-out loss to re-training from scratch, while requiring significantly less computation (2.6x). However, the optimal balance between incorporating new data and replaying old data differs as replay is crucial to avoid forgetting on generic web data but less so on specific domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at: https://github.com/apple/ml-tic-lm</p></details> |

In this work, we introduce OmniScience, a specialized large reasoning model for general science, developed through three key components: (1) domain adaptive pretraining on a carefully curated corpus of scientific literature, (2) instruction tuning on a specialized dataset to guide the model in following domain-specific tasks, and (3) reasoning-based knowledge distillation through fine-tuning to significantly enhance its ability to generate contextually relevant and logically sound responses. We demonstrate the versatility of OmniScience by developing a battery agent that efficiently ranks molecules as potential electrolyte solvents or additives. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that OmniScience is competitive with state-of-the-art large reasoning models on the GPQA Diamond and domain-specific battery benchmarks, while outperforming all public reasoning and non-reasoning models with similar parameter counts. We further demonstrate via ablation experiments that domain adaptive pretraining and reasoning-based knowledge distillation are critical to attain our performance levels, across benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

While deep graph-based models demonstrate strong predictive power, their performance often comes at the cost of high computational overhead and substantial training data requirements, making them impractical for deployment in resource-constrained or data-scarce environments. We propose the FlowDistill, a lightweight and scalable traffic prediction framework based on knowledge distillation from large language models (LLMs). In this teacher-student setup, a fine-tuned LLM guides a compact multi-layer perceptron (MLP) student model using a novel combination of the information bottleneck principle and teacher-bounded regression loss, ensuring the distilled model retains only essential and transferable knowledge. Spatial and temporal correlations are explicitly encoded to enhance the model's generalization across diverse urban settings. Despite its simplicity, FlowDistill consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in prediction accuracy while requiring significantly less training data, and achieving lower memory usage and inference latency, highlighting its efficiency and suitability for real-world, scalable deployment.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces a novel approach to interpreting LLMs by applying inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to recover their implicit reward functions. We conduct experiments on toxicity-aligned LLMs of varying sizes, extracting reward models that achieve up to 85\% accuracy in predicting human preferences. Our analysis reveals key insights into the non-identifiability of reward functions, the relationship between model size and interpretability, and potential pitfalls in the RLHF process. We demonstrate that IRL-derived reward models can be used to fine-tune new LLMs, resulting in comparable or improved performance on toxicity benchmarks. This work provides a new lens for understanding and improving LLM alignment, with implications for the responsible development and deployment of these powerful systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

Their widespread use has sparked concerns, especially through jailbreak attacks that bypass safety measures to produce harmful content. In this paper, we present a comprehensive security analysis of large language models (LLMs), addressing critical research questions on the evolution and determinants of model safety. Specifically, we begin by identifying the most effective techniques for detecting jailbreak attacks. Next, we investigate whether newer versions of LLMs offer improved security compared to their predecessors. We also assess the impact of model size on overall security and explore the potential benefits of integrating multiple defense strategies to enhance model robustness. Our study evaluates both open-source models (e.g., LLaMA and Mistral) and closed-source systems (e.g., GPT-4) by employing four state-of-the-art attack techniques and assessing the efficacy of three new defensive approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Smart Routing: Cost-Effective Multi-LLM Serving for Multi-Core AIOS](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20576v4)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as service endpoints in systems, the surge in query volume creates significant scheduling challenges. Existing scheduling frameworks mainly target at latency optimization while neglecting the capability of LLMs to serve different level of queries, which could lead to computational resource waste. For example, those simple queries can be safely handled by small, fast and cheap LLMs, while those complex and difficult queries need to be handled by large, slow, and expensive LLMs. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing an efficient capability-cost coordinated scheduling framework, ECCOS, for multi-LLM serving, which explicitly constrains response quality and workload to optimize LLM inference cost. Specifically, it introduces the two-stage scheduling by designing a multi-objective predictor and a constrained optimizer. The predictor estimates both model capabilities and computational costs through training-based and retrieval-based approaches, while the optimizer determines cost-optimal assignments under quality and workload constraints. It also introduces QAServe, a dataset for sample-wise response quality and costs collected by zero-shot prompting different LLMs on knowledge QA and mathematical reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ECCOS improves success rates by 6.30% while reducing costs by 10.15% compared to existing methods, consuming less than 0.5% of LLM response time. The code is available at: https://github.com/agiresearch/ECCOS, and the proposed smart routing mechanism has been integrated into AIOS, the AI Agent Operating System, at https://github.com/agiresearch/AIOS.</p></details> |  |

To investigate its impact, we conducted a crowdsourcing study with 450 participants, each completing one of six decision-making tasks spanning public safety, diet and health management, sustainability, and AI ethics. Participants engaged in a multi-prompt conversation with ChatGPT to address the task, allowing us to compare pre-chat intent-based expectations with observed interactions. We found that: 1) Several aspects of pre-chat expectations are closely associated with users' prior experiences with ChatGPT, search engines, and virtual assistants; 2) Prior system experience shapes language use and prompting behavior. Frequent ChatGPT users reduced deictic terms and hedge words and frequently adjusted prompts. Users with rich search experience maintained structured, less-conversational queries with minimal modifications. Users of virtual assistants favored directive, command-like prompts, reinforcing functional fixedness; 3) When the system failed to meet expectations, participants generated more detailed prompts with increased linguistic diversity, reflecting adaptive shifts. These findings suggest that while preconceived expectations constrain early interactions, unmet expectations can motivate behavioral adaptation. With appropriate system support, this may promote broader exploration of LLM capabilities. This work also introduces a typology for user intents in chat search and highlights the importance of mitigating functional fixedness to support more creative and analytical use of LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Resource Allocation in Multi-Agent LLM Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02051v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the development of LLMs as agents, there is a growing interest in connecting multiple agents into multi-agent systems to solve tasks concurrently, focusing on their role in task assignment and coordination. This paper explores how LLMs can effectively allocate computational tasks among multiple agents, considering factors such as cost, efficiency, and performance. In this work, we address key questions, including the effectiveness of LLMs as orchestrators and planners, comparing their effectiveness in task assignment and coordination. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs can achieve high validity and accuracy in resource allocation tasks. We find that the planner method outperforms the orchestrator method in handling concurrent actions, resulting in improved efficiency and better utilization of agents. Additionally, we show that providing explicit information about worker capabilities enhances the allocation strategies of planners, particularly when dealing with suboptimal workers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Survey Collection with LLM-based Conversational Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02891v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Objective: Traditional phone-based surveys are among the most accessible and widely used methods to collect biomedical and healthcare data, however, they are often costly, labor intensive, and difficult to scale effectively. To overcome these limitations, we propose an end-to-end survey collection framework driven by conversational Large Language Models (LLMs). Materials and Methods: Our framework consists of a researcher responsible for designing the survey and recruiting participants, a conversational phone agent powered by an LLM that calls participants and administers the survey, a second LLM (GPT-4o) that analyzes the conversation transcripts generated during the surveys, and a database for storing and organizing the results. To test our framework, we recruited 8 participants consisting of 5 native and 3 non-native english speakers and administered 40 surveys. We evaluated the correctness of LLM-generated conversation transcripts, accuracy of survey responses inferred by GPT-4o and overall participant experience. Results: Survey responses were successfully extracted by GPT-4o from conversation transcripts with an average accuracy of 98% despite transcripts exhibiting an average per-line word error rate of 7.7%. While participants noted occasional errors made by the conversational LLM agent, they reported that the agent effectively conveyed the purpose of the survey, demonstrated good comprehension, and maintained an engaging interaction.

| **[The LLM Wears Prada: Analysing Gender Bias and Stereotypes through Online Shopping Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01951v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the wide and cross-domain adoption of Large Language Models, it becomes crucial to assess to which extent the statistical correlations in training data, which underlie their impressive performance, hide subtle and potentially troubling biases. Gender bias in LLMs has been widely investigated from the perspectives of works, hobbies, and emotions typically associated with a specific gender. In this study, we introduce a novel perspective. We investigate whether LLMs can predict an individual's gender based solely on online shopping histories and whether these predictions are influenced by gender biases and stereotypes. Using a dataset of historical online purchases from users in the United States, we evaluate the ability of six LLMs to classify gender and we then analyze their reasoning and products-gender co-occurrences. Results indicate that while models can infer gender with moderate accuracy, their decisions are often rooted in stereotypical associations between product categories and gender. Furthermore, explicit instructions to avoid bias reduce the certainty of model predictions, but do not eliminate stereotypical patterns. Our findings highlight the persistent nature of gender biases in LLMs and emphasize the need for robust bias-mitigation strategies.</p></details> |  |

However, ensuring the reliability and interpretability of their outputs remains a significant challenge. In our framework, we conceptualize the collaboration between AI and human scientists as a dynamic interplay among three modules: the reasoning module, the interpretation module, and the AI-scientist interaction module. Recognizing that effective physics reasoning demands rigorous logical consistency, quantitative precision, and deep integration with established theoretical models, we introduce the interpretation module to improve the understanding of AI-generated outputs, which is not previously explored in the literature. This module comprises multiple specialized agents, including summarizers, model builders, UI builders, and testers, which collaboratively structure LLM outputs within a physically grounded framework, by constructing a more interpretable science model. A case study demonstrates that our approach enhances transparency, facilitates validation, and strengthens AI-augmented reasoning in scientific discovery.</p></details> |  |

Built on three core principles -- diversity, deliberative reasoning, and rigorous filtering -- STAR-1 aims to address the critical needs for safety alignment in LRMs. Specifically, we begin by integrating existing open-source safety datasets from diverse sources. Then, we curate safety policies to generate policy-grounded deliberative reasoning samples. Lastly, we apply a GPT-4o-based safety scoring system to select training examples aligned with best practices. Experimental results show that fine-tuning LRMs with STAR-1 leads to an average 40% improvement in safety performance across four benchmarks, while only incurring a marginal decrease (e.g., an average of 1.1%) in reasoning ability measured across five reasoning tasks. Extensive ablation studies further validate the importance of our design principles in constructing STAR-1 and analyze its efficacy across both LRMs and traditional LLMs. Our project page is https://ucsc-vlaa.github.io/STAR-1.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling Test-time Compute for Low-resource Languages: Multilingual Reasoning in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02890v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in test-time compute scaling have enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle deep reasoning tasks by generating a chain-of-thought (CoT) that includes trial and error, backtracking, and intermediate reasoning steps before producing the final answer. However, these techniques have been applied predominantly to popular languages, such as English, leaving reasoning in low-resource languages underexplored and misaligned. In this work, we investigate the multilingual mechanism by which LLMs internally operate in a latent space biased toward their inherently dominant language. To leverage this phenomenon for low-resource languages, we train models to generate the CoT in English while outputting the final response in the target language, given input in the low-resource language. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach, named English-Pivoted CoT Training, outperforms other baselines, including training to generate both the CoT and the final response solely in the target language, with up to 28.33% improvement. Further analysis provides novel insights into the relationships between reasoning and multilinguality of LLMs, prompting for better approaches in developing multilingual large reasoning models</p></details> |  |
| **[TransientTables: Evaluating LLMs' Reasoning on Temporally Evolving Semi-structured Tables](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01879v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans continuously make new discoveries, and understanding temporal sequence of events leading to these breakthroughs is essential for advancing science and society. This ability to reason over time allows us to identify future steps and understand the effects of financial and political decisions on our lives. However, large language models (LLMs) are typically trained on static datasets, limiting their ability to perform effective temporal reasoning. To assess the temporal reasoning capabilities of LLMs, we present the TRANSIENTTABLES dataset, which comprises 3,971 questions derived from over 14,000 tables, spanning 1,238 entities across multiple time periods. We introduce a template-based question-generation pipeline that harnesses LLMs to refine both templates and questions. Additionally, we establish baseline results using state-of-the-art LLMs to create a benchmark. We also introduce novel modeling strategies centered around task decomposition, enhancing LLM performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 Pa...</summary><p>19 Pages. 21 Tables, 1 figure</p></details> |

Leveraging advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and multi-agent architectures, we propose a novel framework for quantitative stock investment in portfolio management and alpha mining. Our framework addresses these issues by integrating LLMs to generate diversified alphas and employing a multi-agent approach to dynamically evaluate market conditions. This paper proposes a framework where large language models (LLMs) mine alpha factors from multimodal financial data, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of market dynamics. The first module extracts predictive signals by integrating numerical data, research papers, and visual charts. The second module uses ensemble learning to construct a diverse pool of trading agents with varying risk preferences, enhancing strategy performance through a broader market analysis. In the third module, a dynamic weight-gating mechanism selects and assigns weights to the most relevant agents based on real-time market conditions, enabling the creation of an adaptive and context-aware composite alpha formula. Extensive experiments on the Chinese stock markets demonstrate that this framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple financial metrics. The results underscore the efficacy of combining LLM-generated alphas with a multi-agent architecture to achieve superior trading performance and stability. This work highlights the potential of AI-driven approaches in enhancing quantitative investment strategies and sets a new benchmark for integrating advanced machine learning techniques in financial trading can also be applied on diverse markets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Non-Determinism of "Deterministic" LLM Settings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04667v5)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM (large language model) practitioners commonly notice that outputs can vary for the same inputs under settings expected to be deterministic. Yet the questions of how pervasive this is, and with what impact on results, have not to our knowledge been systematically investigated. We investigate non-determinism in five LLMs configured to be deterministic when applied to eight common tasks in across 10 runs, in both zero-shot and few-shot settings. We see accuracy variations up to 15% across naturally occurring runs with a gap of best possible performance to worst possible performance up to 70%. In fact, none of the LLMs consistently delivers repeatable accuracy across all tasks, much less identical output strings. Sharing preliminary results with insiders has revealed that non-determinism perhaps essential to the efficient use of compute resources via co-mingled data in input buffers so this issue is not going away anytime soon. To better quantify our observations, we introduce metrics focused on quantifying determinism, TARr@N for the total agreement rate at N runs over raw output, and TARa@N for total agreement rate of parsed-out answers. Our code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/breckbaldwin/llm-stability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing LLMs in Long Code Translation through Instrumentation and Program State Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02017v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code translation aims to transform code between programming languages while preserving functionality, with applications in cross-platform development and software migration. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have improved code translation, but challenges remain, particularly in inferring program functionality. These issues worsen with longer and more complex code, where current LLMs struggle to handle length and intricate semantics. To evaluate LLMs on long code translation, we introduce LongTrans, a large-scale execution-based benchmark with C++, Java, and Python programs, ranging from hundreds to thousands of tokens. Our empirical study of 12 LLMs reveals a sharp performance decline as code length increases, with even the best-performing model, GPT-4o, achieving only 57.51% computational accuracy. This highlights the need for further research in long code translation. We argue that code translation should maintain invariant functionality while transforming syntax and keywords across languages. Despite differences in appearance, program states should remain consistent throughout execution. To address this, we propose PAST (Program State Alignment augmented Translation), which integrates instrumentation to capture and align program states during translation. This approach is the first to leverage LLMs to insert instrumentation in both original and translated code, tracing program states at runtime. By prompting the LLM to correct errors based on output traces, we mitigate inconsistencies and enhance translation accuracy. Experimental results show significant improvements, with computational accuracy rising from 57.51% to 84.70% for GPT-4o, 50.68% to 69.97% for Mistral-Large-2, and 52.45% to 76.43% for DeepSeek-Coder-V2. These improvements are consistent across models and datasets, with ablation studies confirming the benefits of instrumentation and state alignment.</p></details> | 20 pages |

This paper proposes a novel framework called USER-LLM R1 for a user-aware conversational agent that addresses this challenge through dynamic user profiling and model initiation. Our approach integrates chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning models to iteratively infer user preferences and vision-language models (VLMs) to initialize user profiles from multimodal inputs, enabling personalized interactions from the first encounter. Leveraging a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture, the system dynamically refines user representations within an inherent CoT process, ensuring contextually relevant and adaptive responses. Evaluations on the ElderlyTech-VQA Bench demonstrate significant improvements in ROUGE-1 (+23.2%), ROUGE-2 (+0.6%), and ROUGE-L (+8%) F1 scores over state-of-the-art baselines, with ablation studies underscoring the impact of reasoning model size on performance. Human evaluations further validate the framework's efficacy, particularly for elderly users, where tailored responses enhance engagement and trust. Ethical considerations, including privacy preservation and bias mitigation, are rigorously discussed and addressed to ensure responsible deployment.</p></details> |  |

However, the effectiveness of RL in social reasoning, particularly in Theory of Mind (ToM), the ability to infer others' mental states, remains largely unexplored. In this study, we demonstrate that RL methods effectively unlock ToM reasoning capabilities even in small-scale LLMs (0.5B to 7B parameters). Using a modest dataset comprising 3200 questions across diverse scenarios, our RL-trained 7B model achieves 84.50\% accuracy on the Hi-ToM benchmark, surpassing models like GPT-4o and DeepSeek-v3 despite significantly fewer parameters. While smaller models ($\leq$3B parameters) suffer from reasoning collapse, larger models (7B parameters) maintain stable performance through consistent belief tracking. Additionally, our RL-based models demonstrate robust generalization to higher-order, out-of-distribution ToM problems, novel textual presentations, and previously unseen datasets. These findings highlight RL's potential to enhance social cognitive reasoning, bridging the gap between structured problem-solving and nuanced social inference in LLMs.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Open-Qwen2VL, a fully open-source 2B-parameter Multimodal Large Language Model pre-trained efficiently on 29M image-text pairs using only 220 A100-40G GPU hours. Our approach employs low-to-high dynamic image resolution and multimodal sequence packing to significantly enhance pre-training efficiency. The training dataset was carefully curated using both MLLM-based filtering techniques (e.g., MLM-Filter) and conventional CLIP-based filtering methods, substantially improving data quality and training efficiency. The Open-Qwen2VL pre-training is conducted on academic level 8xA100-40G GPUs at UCSB on 5B packed multimodal tokens, which is 0.36% of 1.4T multimodal pre-training tokens of Qwen2-VL. The final instruction-tuned Open-Qwen2VL outperforms partially-open state-of-the-art MLLM Qwen2-VL-2B on various multimodal benchmarks of MMBench, SEEDBench, MMstar, and MathVista, indicating the remarkable training efficiency of Open-Qwen2VL. We open-source all aspects of our work, including compute-efficient and data-efficient training details, data filtering methods, sequence packing scripts, pre-training data in WebDataset format, FSDP-based training codebase, and both base and instruction-tuned model checkpoints. We redefine "fully open" for multimodal LLMs as the complete release of: 1) the training codebase, 2) detailed data filtering techniques, and 3) all pre-training and supervised fine-tuning data used to develop the model.</p></details> |  |

Understanding user behavior within the comments section is essential for comprehensive user interest modeling. A key factor of user engagement is staytime, which refers to the amount of time that users browse and post comments. Existing watchtime prediction methods struggle to adapt to staytime prediction, overlooking interactions with individual comments and their interrelation. In this paper, we present a micro-video recommendation dataset with video comments (named as KuaiComt) which is collected from Kuaishou platform. correspondingly, we propose a practical framework for comment staytime prediction with LLM-enhanced Comment Understanding (LCU). Our framework leverages the strong text comprehension capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to understand textual information of comments, while also incorporating fine-grained comment ranking signals as auxiliary tasks. The framework is two-staged: first, the LLM is fine-tuned using domain-specific tasks to bridge the video and the comments; second, we incorporate the LLM outputs into the prediction model and design two comment ranking auxiliary tasks to better understand user preference. Extensive offline experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, showing significant improvements on the task of comment staytime prediction. Additionally, online A/B testing further validates the practical benefits on industrial scenario.

While Large Language Models show promise in human-like communication, their standalone use is hindered by memory constraints and contextual incoherence. This work presents a multimodal, cognitively inspired framework that enhances LLM-based autonomous decision-making in social and task-oriented Human-Robot Interaction. Specifically, we develop an LLM-based agent for a robot trainer, balancing social conversation with task guidance and goal-driven motivation. To further enhance autonomy and personalization, we introduce a memory system for selecting, storing and retrieving experiences, facilitating generalized reasoning based on knowledge built across different interactions. A preliminary HRI user study and offline experiments with a synthetic dataset validate our approach, demonstrating the system's ability to manage complex interactions, autonomously drive training tasks, and build and retrieve contextual memories, advancing socially intelligent robotics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) 2025</p></details> |

From statistical quality flags to LLM-based labeling systems, datasets are divided into categories, frequently reducing to a binary: those passing the filters deemed as valuable examples, others discarded as useless or detrimental. However, a more detailed understanding of the contribution of different kinds of texts to model performance is still largely lacking. In this article, we present the first study utilizing registers (also known as genres) - a widely used standard in corpus linguistics to model linguistic variation - to curate pretraining datasets and investigate the effect of register on the performance of LLMs. We perform comparative studies by training models with register classified data and evaluating them using standard benchmarks, and show that the register of pretraining data substantially affects model performance. We uncover surprising relationships between the pretraining material and the resulting models: using the News register results in subpar performance, and on the contrary, including the Opinion class, covering texts such as reviews and opinion blogs, is highly beneficial. While a model trained on the entire unfiltered dataset outperforms those trained on datasets limited to a single register, combining well-performing registers like How-to-Instructions, Informational Description, and Opinion leads to major improvements. Furthermore, analysis of individual benchmark results reveals key differences in the strengths and drawbacks of specific register classes as pretraining data. These findings show that register is an important explainer of model variation and can facilitate more deliberate future data selection practices.</p></details> |  |

Multi-LLM Repeated Sampling Efficiently Scales Test-Time Compute](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00762v2)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a simple, effective, and cost-efficient strategy to improve LLM performance by scaling test-time compute. Our strategy builds upon the repeated-sampling-then-voting framework, with a novel twist: incorporating multiple models, even weaker ones, to leverage their complementary strengths that potentially arise from diverse training data and paradigms. By using consistency as a signal, our strategy dynamically switches between models. Theoretical analysis highlights the efficiency and performance advantages of our strategy. Extensive experiments on six datasets demonstrate that our strategy not only outperforms self-consistency and state-of-the-art multi-agent debate approaches, but also significantly reduces inference costs. Additionally, ModelSwitch requires only a few comparable LLMs to achieve optimal performance and can be extended with verification methods, demonstrating the potential of leveraging multiple LLMs in the generation-verification paradigm.</p></details> |  |

Existing jailbreaking methods fall into two main categories: template-based and optimization-based methods. The former requires significant manual effort and domain knowledge, while the latter, exemplified by Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG), which seeks to maximize the likelihood of harmful LLM outputs through token-level optimization, also encounters several limitations: requiring white-box access, necessitating pre-constructed affirmative phrase, and suffering from low efficiency. In this paper, we present ECLIPSE, a novel and efficient black-box jailbreaking method utilizing optimizable suffixes. Drawing inspiration from LLMs' powerful generation and optimization capabilities, we employ task prompts to translate jailbreaking goals into natural language instructions. This guides the LLM to generate adversarial suffixes for malicious queries. In particular, a harmfulness scorer provides continuous feedback, enabling LLM self-reflection and iterative optimization to autonomously and efficiently produce effective suffixes. Experimental results demonstrate that ECLIPSE achieves an average attack success rate (ASR) of 0.92 across three open-source LLMs and GPT-3.5-Turbo, significantly surpassing GCG in 2.4 times. Moreover, ECLIPSE is on par with template-based methods in ASR while offering superior attack efficiency, reducing the average attack overhead by 83%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Be ac...</summary><p>Be accepeted as NAACL2025 Findings</p></details> |

A Deep Look at Temporal Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08460v3)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to the development of benchmarks that consider temporal dynamics, however, there remains a gap in understanding how well these models can generalize across temporal contexts due to the inherent dynamic nature of language and information. This paper introduces the concept of temporal generalization in LLMs, including bias in past and future generalizations. Then we introduce FreshBench, a new evaluation framework that employs fresh text and event prediction for assessing LLMs' temporal adaptability, ensuring the evaluation process free from data leakage and subjective bias. The experiment shows significant temporal biases and a decline in performance over time. Our findings reveal that powerful models, while initially superior, tend to decline more rapidly in future generalization. Additionally, powerful open-source models demonstrate better long-term adaptability compared to their closed-source counterparts.

Early efforts have leveraged LLMs' rich knowledge and strong generalization capabilities via in-context learning, where recommendation tasks are framed as prompts. However, LLM performance in recommendation scenarios remains limited due to the mismatch between their pretraining objectives and recommendation tasks, as well as the lack of recommendation-specific data during pretraining. To address these challenges, we propose DPO4Rec, a novel framework that integrates Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) into LLM-enhanced recommendation systems. First, we prompt the LLM to infer user preferences from historical interactions, which are then used to augment traditional ID-based sequential recommendation models. Next, we train a reward model based on knowledge-augmented recommendation architectures to assess the quality of LLM-generated reasoning. Using this, we select the highest- and lowest-ranked responses from N samples to construct a dataset for LLM fine-tuning. Finally, we apply a structure alignment strategy via DPO to align the LLM's outputs with desirable recommendation behavior. Extensive experiments show that DPO4Rec significantly improves re-ranking performance over strong baselines, demonstrating enhanced instruction-following capabilities of LLMs in recommendation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted to ICME 2025</p></details> |

They have recently garnered attention due to their capability to address complex tasks involving both modalities. However, their effectiveness is limited to the knowledge acquired during training, which restricts their practical utility. In this work, we introduce a novel method to enhance the adaptability of MLLMs by integrating external knowledge sources. Our proposed model, Reflective LLaVA (ReflectiVA), utilizes reflective tokens to dynamically determine the need for external knowledge and predict the relevance of information retrieved from an external database. Tokens are trained following a two-stage two-model training recipe. This ultimately enables the MLLM to manage external knowledge while preserving fluency and performance on tasks where external knowledge is not needed. Through our experiments, we demonstrate the efficacy of ReflectiVA for knowledge-based visual question answering, highlighting its superior performance compared to existing methods.

Our preliminary study indicates that pretrained LLMs fail catastrophically on fine-grained HAR tasks such as air-written letter recognition, achieving only near-random guessing accuracy. In this work, we first bridge this gap for flat-surface writing scenarios: by fine-tuning LLMs with a self-collected dataset and few-shot learning, we achieved up to a 129x improvement on 2D data. To extend this to 3D scenarios, we designed an encoder-based pipeline that maps 3D data into 2D equivalents, preserving the spatiotemporal information for robust letter prediction. Our end-to-end pipeline achieves 78% accuracy on word recognition with up to 5 letters in mid-air writing scenarios, establishing LLMs as viable tools for fine-grained HAR.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to The 2nd International Workshop on Foundation Models for Cyber-Physical Systems & Internet of Things (FMSys 2025)</p></details> |

There has been limited study about the assessment of the quality of translations generated by LLMs, including Gemini, GPT and Google Translate. In this study, we address this limitation by using semantic and sentiment analysis of selected LLMs for Indian languages, including Sanskrit, Telugu and Hindi. We select prominent texts that have been well translated by experts and use LLMs to generate their translations to English, and then we provide a comparison with selected expert (human) translations. Our findings suggest that while LLMs have made significant progress in translation accuracy, challenges remain in preserving sentiment and semantic integrity, especially in figurative and philosophical contexts. The sentiment analysis revealed that GPT-4o and GPT-3.5 are better at preserving the sentiments for the Bhagavad Gita (Sanskrit-English) translations when compared to Google Translate. We observed a similar trend for the case of Tamas (Hindi-English) and Maha P (Telugu-English) translations. GPT-4o performs similarly to GPT-3.5 in the translation in terms of sentiments for the three languages. We found that LLMs are generally better at translation for capturing sentiments when compared to Google Translate.</p></details> |  |

Existing LLM-based retrieval methods generate numeric or content-based DocIDs to retrieve docs/ads. However, the one-to-few mapping between numeric IDs and docs, along with the time-consuming content extraction, leads to semantic inefficiency and limits scalability in large-scale corpora. In this paper, we propose the Real-time Ad REtrieval (RARE) framework, which leverages LLM-generated text called Commercial Intentions (CIs) as an intermediate semantic representation to directly retrieve ads for queries in real-time. These CIs are generated by a customized LLM injected with commercial knowledge, enhancing its domain relevance. Each CI corresponds to multiple ads, yielding a lightweight and scalable set of CIs. RARE has been implemented in a real-world online system, handling daily search volumes in the hundreds of millions. The online implementation has yielded significant benefits: a 5.04% increase in consumption, a 6.37% rise in Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV), a 1.28% enhancement in click-through rate (CTR) and a 5.29% increase in shallow conversions. Extensive offline experiments show RARE's superiority over ten competitive baselines in four major categories.</p></details> | 13pages,5 figures |
| **[ThinkPrune: Pruning Long Chain-of-Thought of LLMs via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01296v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present ThinkPrune, a simple yet effective method for pruning the thinking length for long-thinking LLMs, which has been found to often produce inefficient and redundant thinking processes. Existing preliminary explorations of reducing thinking length primarily focus on forcing the thinking process to early exit, rather than adapting the LLM to optimize and consolidate the thinking process, and therefore the length-performance tradeoff observed so far is sub-optimal. To fill this gap, ThinkPrune offers a simple solution that continuously trains the long-thinking LLMs via reinforcement learning (RL) with an added token limit, beyond which any unfinished thoughts and answers will be discarded, resulting in a zero reward. To further preserve model performance, we introduce an iterative length pruning approach, where multiple rounds of RL are conducted, each with an increasingly more stringent token limit. We observed that ThinkPrune results in a remarkable performance-length tradeoff -- on the AIME24 dataset, the reasoning length of DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B can be reduced by half with only 2% drop in performance. We also observed that after pruning, the LLMs can bypass unnecessary steps while keeping the core reasoning process complete.

| **[Extracting Formal Specifications from Documents Using LLMs for Automated Testing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01294v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated testing plays a crucial role in ensuring software security. It heavily relies on formal specifications to validate the correctness of the system behavior. However, the main approach to defining these formal specifications is through manual analysis of software documents, which requires a significant amount of engineering effort from experienced researchers and engineers. Meanwhile, system update further increases the human labor cost to maintain a corresponding formal specification, making the manual analysis approach a time-consuming and error-prone task. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising capabilities in natural language understanding. Yet, the feasibility of using LLMs to automate the extraction of formal specifications from software documents remains unexplored. We conduct an empirical study by constructing a comprehensive dataset comprising 603 specifications from 37 documents across three representative open-source software. We then evaluate the most recent LLMs' capabilities in extracting formal specifications from documents in an end-to-end fashion, including GPT-4o, Claude, and Llama. Our study demonstrates the application of LLMs in formal specification extraction tasks while identifying two major limitations: specification oversimplification and specification fabrication. We attribute these deficiencies to the LLMs' inherent limitations in processing and expressive capabilities, as well as their tendency to fabricate fictional information. Inspired by human cognitive processes, we propose a two-stage method, annotation-then-conversion, to address these challenges. Our method demonstrates significant improvements over the end-to-end method, with a 29.2% increase in the number of correctly extracted specifications and a 14.0% improvement in average accuracy. In particular, our best-performing LLM achieves an accuracy of 71.6%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Grounding Multimodal LLMs to Embodied Agents that Ask for Help with Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00907v2)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied agents operating in real-world environments must interpret ambiguous and under-specified human instructions. A capable household robot should recognize ambiguity and ask relevant clarification questions to infer the user intent accurately, leading to more effective task execution. To study this problem, we introduce the Ask-to-Act task, where an embodied agent must fetch a specific object instance given an ambiguous instruction in a home environment. The agent must strategically ask minimal, yet relevant, clarification questions to resolve ambiguity while navigating under partial observability. To solve this problem, we propose a novel approach that fine-tunes multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as vision-language-action (VLA) policies using online reinforcement learning (RL) with LLM-generated rewards. Our method eliminates the need for large-scale human demonstrations or manually engineered rewards for training such agents. We benchmark against strong zero-shot baselines, including GPT-4o, and supervised fine-tuned MLLMs, on our task. Our results demonstrate that our RL-finetuned MLLM outperforms all baselines by a significant margin ($19.1$-$40.3\%$), generalizing well to novel scenes and tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of adapting MLLMs as VLA agents that can act and ask for help using LLM-generated rewards with online RL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompt-Reverse Inconsistency: LLM Self-Inconsistency Beyond Generative Randomness and Prompt Paraphrasing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01282v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While the inconsistency of LLMs is not a novel topic, prior research has predominantly addressed two types of generative inconsistencies: i) Randomness Inconsistency: running the same LLM multiple trials, yielding varying responses; ii) Paraphrase Inconsistency: paraphrased prompts result in different responses from the same LLM. Randomness Inconsistency arises from the inherent randomness due to stochastic sampling in generative models, while Paraphrase Inconsistency is a consequence of the language modeling objectives, where paraphrased prompts alter the distribution of vocabulary logits. This research discovers Prompt-Reverse Inconsistency (PRIN), a new form of LLM self-inconsistency: given a question and a couple of LLM-generated answer candidates, the LLM often has conflicting responses when prompted "Which are correct answers?" and "Which are incorrect answers?". PRIN poses a big concern as it undermines the credibility of LLM-as-a-judge, and suggests a challenge for LLMs to adhere to basic logical rules. We conduct a series of experiments to investigate PRIN, examining the extent of PRIN across different LLMs, methods to mitigate it, potential applications, and its relationship with Randomness Inconsistency and Paraphrase Inconsistency. As the first study to explore PRIN, our findings offer valuable insights into the inner workings of LLMs and contribute to advancing trustworthy AI.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[Facilitating Instructors-LLM Collaboration for Problem Design in Introductory Programming Classrooms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01259v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, offer significant opportunities to enhance instructional support in introductory programming courses. While extensive research has explored the effectiveness of LLMs in supporting student learning, limited studies have examined how these models can assist instructors in designing instructional activities. This work investigates how instructors' expertise in effective activity design can be integrated with LLMs' ability to generate novel and targeted programming problems, facilitating more effective activity creation for programming classrooms. To achieve this, we employ a participatory design approach to develop an instructor-authoring tool that incorporates LLM support, fostering collaboration between instructors and AI in generating programming exercises. This tool also allows instructors to specify common student mistakes and misconceptions, which informs the adaptive feedback generation process. We conduct case studies with three instructors, analyzing how they use our system to design programming problems for their introductory courses. Through these case studies, we assess instructors' perceptions of the usefulness and limitations of LLMs in authoring problem statements for instructional purposes. Additionally, we compare the efficiency, quality, effectiveness, and coverage of designed activities when instructors create problems with and without structured LLM prompting guidelines. Our findings provide insights into the potential of LLMs in enhancing instructor workflows and improving programming education and provide guidelines for designing effective AI-assisted problem-authoring interfaces.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CHI 2025 Workshop on Augmented Educators and AI: Shaping the Future of Human and AI Cooperation in Learning</p></details> |
| **[EditRoom: LLM-parameterized Graph Diffusion for Composable 3D Room Layout Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12836v2)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given the steep learning curve of professional 3D software and the time-consuming process of managing large 3D assets, language-guided 3D scene editing has significant potential in fields such as virtual reality, augmented reality, and gaming. However, recent approaches to language-guided 3D scene editing either require manual interventions or focus only on appearance modifications without supporting comprehensive scene layout changes. In response, we propose EditRoom, a unified framework capable of executing a variety of layout edits through natural language commands, without requiring manual intervention. Specifically, EditRoom leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for command planning and generates target scenes using a diffusion-based method, enabling six types of edits: rotate, translate, scale, replace, add, and remove. To address the lack of data for language-guided 3D scene editing, we have developed an automatic pipeline to augment existing 3D scene synthesis datasets and introduced EditRoom-DB, a large-scale dataset with 83k editing pairs, for training and evaluation. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms other baselines across all metrics, indicating higher accuracy and coherence in language-guided scene layout editing.</p></details> |  |

| **[Catastrophic Forgetting in LLMs: A Comparative Analysis Across Language Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01241v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP), particularly in Natural Language Understanding (NLU) tasks. As we progress toward an agentic world where LLM-based agents autonomously handle specialized tasks, it becomes crucial for these models to adapt to new tasks without forgetting previously learned information - a challenge known as catastrophic forgetting. This study evaluates the continual fine-tuning of various open-source LLMs with different parameter sizes (specifically models under 10 billion parameters) on key NLU tasks from the GLUE benchmark, including SST-2, MRPC, CoLA, and MNLI. By employing prompt engineering and task-specific adjustments, we assess and compare the models' abilities to retain prior knowledge while learning new tasks. Our results indicate that models such as Phi-3.5-mini exhibit minimal forgetting while maintaining strong learning capabilities, making them well-suited for continual learning environments. Additionally, models like Orca-2-7b and Qwen2.5-7B demonstrate impressive learning abilities and overall performance after fine-tuning. This work contributes to understanding catastrophic forgetting in LLMs and highlights prompting engineering to optimize model performance for continual learning scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-LLM Text Summarization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15487v2)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we propose a Multi-LLM summarization framework, and investigate two different multi-LLM strategies including centralized and decentralized. Our multi-LLM summarization framework has two fundamentally important steps at each round of conversation: generation and evaluation. These steps are different depending on whether our multi-LLM decentralized summarization is used or centralized. In both our multi-LLM decentralized and centralized strategies, we have k different LLMs that generate diverse summaries of the text. However, during evaluation, our multi-LLM centralized summarization approach leverages a single LLM to evaluate the summaries and select the best one whereas k LLMs are used for decentralized multi-LLM summarization. Overall, we find that our multi-LLM summarization approaches significantly outperform the baselines that leverage only a single LLM by up to 3x. These results indicate the effectiveness of multi-LLM approaches for summarization.</p></details> |  |
