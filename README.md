| **[MetaScenes: Towards Automated Replica Creation for Real-world 3D Scans](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02388v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI (EAI) research requires high-quality, diverse 3D scenes to effectively support skill acquisition, sim-to-real transfer, and generalization. Achieving these quality standards, however, necessitates the precise replication of real-world object diversity. Existing datasets demonstrate that this process heavily relies on artist-driven designs, which demand substantial human effort and present significant scalability challenges. To scalably produce realistic and interactive 3D scenes, we first present MetaScenes, a large-scale, simulatable 3D scene dataset constructed from real-world scans, which includes 15366 objects spanning 831 fine-grained categories. Then, we introduce Scan2Sim, a robust multi-modal alignment model, which enables the automated, high-quality replacement of assets, thereby eliminating the reliance on artist-driven designs for scaling 3D scenes. We further propose two benchmarks to evaluate MetaScenes: a detailed scene synthesis task focused on small item layouts for robotic manipulation and a domain transfer task in vision-and-language navigation (VLN) to validate cross-domain transfer. Results confirm MetaScene's potential to enhance EAI by supporting more generalizable agent learning and sim-to-real applications, introducing new possibilities for EAI research.

The agent must accurately locate the target based on visual information from the environment and complete tasks through interaction with the surroundings. Despite significant advancements in this field, two major limitations persist: (1) Many existing methods input complete language instructions directly into multi-layer Transformer networks without fully exploiting the detailed information within the instructions, thereby limiting the agent's language understanding capabilities during task execution; (2) Current approaches often overlook the modeling of object relationships across different modalities, failing to effectively utilize latent clues between objects, which affects the accuracy and robustness of navigation decisions. We propose a Dual Object Perception-Enhancement Network (DOPE) to address these issues to improve navigation performance. First, we design a Text Semantic Extraction (TSE) to extract relatively essential phrases from the text and input them into the Text Object Perception-Augmentation (TOPA) to fully leverage details such as objects and actions within the instructions. Second, we introduce an Image Object Perception-Augmentation (IOPA), which performs additional modeling of object information across different modalities, enabling the model to more effectively utilize latent clues between objects in images and text, enhancing decision-making accuracy. Extensive experiments on the R2R and REVERIE datasets validate the efficacy of the proposed approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main paper (10 pages).

| **[Think Hierarchically, Act Dynamically: Hierarchical Multi-modal Fusion and Reasoning for Vision-and-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16516v2)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) aims to enable embodied agents to follow natural language instructions and reach target locations in real-world environments. While prior methods often rely on either global scene representations or object-level features, these approaches are insufficient for capturing the complex interactions across modalities required for accurate navigation. In this paper, we propose a Multi-level Fusion and Reasoning Architecture (MFRA) to enhance the agent's ability to reason over visual observations, language instructions and navigation history. Specifically, MFRA introduces a hierarchical fusion mechanism that aggregates multi-level features-ranging from low-level visual cues to high-level semantic concepts-across multiple modalities. We further design a reasoning module that leverages fused representations to infer navigation actions through instruction-guided attention and dynamic context integration. By selectively capturing and combining relevant visual, linguistic, and temporal signals, MFRA improves decision-making accuracy in complex navigation scenarios. Extensive experiments on benchmark VLN datasets including REVERIE, R2R, and SOON demonstrate that MFRA achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, validating the effectiveness of multi-level modal fusion for embodied navigation.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 4 figures, Submitted to ACM MM 2025</p></details> |
| **[ST-Booster: An Iterative SpatioTemporal Perception Booster for Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09843v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) requires agents to navigate unknown, continuous spaces based on natural language instructions. Compared to discrete settings, VLN-CE poses two core perception challenges. First, the absence of predefined observation points leads to heterogeneous visual memories and weakened global spatial correlations. Second, cumulative reconstruction errors in three-dimensional scenes introduce structural noise, impairing local feature perception. To address these challenges, this paper proposes ST-Booster, an iterative spatiotemporal booster that enhances navigation performance through multi-granularity perception and instruction-aware reasoning. ST-Booster consists of three key modules -- Hierarchical SpatioTemporal Encoding (HSTE), Multi-Granularity Aligned Fusion (MGAF), and ValueGuided Waypoint Generation (VGWG). HSTE encodes long-term global memory using topological graphs and captures shortterm local details via grid maps. MGAF aligns these dualmap representations with instructions through geometry-aware knowledge fusion. The resulting representations are iteratively refined through pretraining tasks. During reasoning, VGWG generates Guided Attention Heatmaps (GAHs) to explicitly model environment-instruction relevance and optimize waypoint selection. Extensive comparative experiments and performance analyses are conducted, demonstrating that ST-Booster outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, particularly in complex, disturbance-prone environments.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Endowing Embodied Agents with Spatial Reasoning Capabilities for Vision-and-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08806v1)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enhancing the spatial perception capabilities of mobile robots is crucial for achieving embodied Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN). Although significant progress has been made in simulated environments, directly transferring these capabilities to real-world scenarios often results in severe hallucination phenomena, causing robots to lose effective spatial awareness. To address this issue, we propose BrainNav, a bio-inspired spatial cognitive navigation framework inspired by biological spatial cognition theories and cognitive map theory. BrainNav integrates dual-map (coordinate map and topological map) and dual-orientation (relative orientation and absolute orientation) strategies, enabling real-time navigation through dynamic scene capture and path planning. Its five core modules-Hippocampal Memory Hub, Visual Cortex Perception Engine, Parietal Spatial Constructor, Prefrontal Decision Center, and Cerebellar Motion Execution Unit-mimic biological cognitive functions to reduce spatial hallucinations and enhance adaptability. Validated in a zero-shot real-world lab environment using the Limo Pro robot, BrainNav, compatible with GPT-4, outperforms existing State-of-the-Art (SOTA) Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) methods without fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agent Journey Beyond RGB: Unveiling Hybrid Semantic-Spatial Environmental Representations for Vision-and-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06465v4)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Navigating unseen environments based on natural language instructions remains difficult for egocentric agents in Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN). Existing approaches primarily rely on RGB images for environmental representation, underutilizing latent textual semantic and spatial cues and leaving the modality gap between instructions and scarce environmental representations unresolved. Intuitively, humans inherently ground semantic knowledge within spatial layouts during indoor navigation. Inspired by this, we propose a versatile Semantic Understanding and Spatial Awareness (SUSA) architecture to encourage agents to ground environment from diverse perspectives. SUSA includes a Textual Semantic Understanding (TSU) module, which narrows the modality gap between instructions and environments by generating and associating the descriptions of environmental landmarks in agent's immediate surroundings. Additionally, a Depth-enhanced Spatial Perception (DSP) module incrementally constructs a depth exploration map, enabling a more nuanced comprehension of environmental layouts. Experiments demonstrate that SUSA's hybrid semantic-spatial representations effectively enhance navigation performance, setting new state-of-the-art performance across three VLN benchmarks (REVERIE, R2R, and SOON). The source code will be publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>A tec...</summary><p>A technical report consisting of 16 pages, 12 figures, 11 tables</p></details> |
| **[COSMO: Combination of Selective Memorization for Low-cost Vision-and-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24065v1)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) tasks have gained prominence within artificial intelligence research due to their potential application in fields like home assistants. Many contemporary VLN approaches, while based on transformer architectures, have increasingly incorporated additional components such as external knowledge bases or map information to enhance performance. These additions, while boosting performance, also lead to larger models and increased computational costs. In this paper, to achieve both high performance and low computational costs, we propose a novel architecture with the COmbination of Selective MemOrization (COSMO). Specifically, COSMO integrates state-space modules and transformer modules, and incorporates two VLN-customized selective state space modules: the Round Selective Scan (RSS) and the Cross-modal Selective State Space Module (CS3). RSS facilitates comprehensive inter-modal interactions within a single scan, while the CS3 module adapts the selective state space module into a dual-stream architecture, thereby enhancing the acquisition of cross-modal interactions. Experimental validations on three mainstream VLN benchmarks, REVERIE, R2R, and R2R-CE, not only demonstrate competitive navigation performance of our model but also show a significant reduction in computational costs.</p></details> |  |
| **[NavCoT: Boosting LLM-Based Vision-and-Language Navigation via Learning Disentangled Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07376v2)** | 2025-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN), as a crucial research problem of Embodied AI, requires an embodied agent to navigate through complex 3D environments following natural language instructions. Recent research has highlighted the promising capacity of large language models (LLMs) in VLN by improving navigational reasoning accuracy and interpretability. However, their predominant use in an offline manner usually suffers from substantial domain gap between the VLN task and the LLM training corpus. This paper introduces a novel strategy called Navigational Chain-of-Thought (NavCoT), where we fulfill parameter-efficient in-domain training to enable self-guided navigational decision, leading to a significant mitigation of the domain gap in a cost-effective manner. Specifically, at each timestep, the LLM is prompted to forecast the navigational chain-of-thought by: 1) acting as a world model to imagine the next observation according to the instruction, 2) selecting the candidate observation that best aligns with the imagination, and 3) determining the action based on the reasoning from the prior steps. Through constructing formalized labels for training, the LLM can learn to generate desired and reasonable chain-of-thought outputs for improving the action decision. Experimental results across various training settings and popular VLN benchmarks (e.g., Room-to-Room (R2R), Room-across-Room (RxR), Room-for-Room (R4R)) show the significant superiority of NavCoT over the direct action prediction variants. Through simple parameter-efficient finetuning, our NavCoT outperforms a recent GPT4-based approach with ~7% relative improvement on the R2R dataset. We believe that NavCoT will help unlock more task-adaptive and scalable LLM-based embodied agents, which are helpful for developing real-world robotics applications. Code is available at https://github.com/expectorlin/NavCoT.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TPAMI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Do Visual Imaginations Improve Vision-and-Language Navigation Agents?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16394v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) agents are tasked with navigating an unseen environment using natural language instructions. In this work, we study if visual representations of sub-goals implied by the instructions can serve as navigational cues and lead to increased navigation performance. To synthesize these visual representations or imaginations, we leverage a text-to-image diffusion model on landmark references contained in segmented instructions. These imaginations are provided to VLN agents as an added modality to act as landmark cues and an auxiliary loss is added to explicitly encourage relating these with their corresponding referring expressions. Our findings reveal an increase in success rate (SR) of around 1 point and up to 0.5 points in success scaled by inverse path length (SPL) across agents. These results suggest that the proposed approach reinforces visual understanding compared to relying on language instructions alone. Code and data for our work can be found at https://www.akhilperincherry.com/VLN-Imagine-website/.</p></details> |  |
| **[RoomTour3D: Geometry-Aware Video-Instruction Tuning for Embodied Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08591v2)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) suffers from the limited diversity and scale of training data, primarily constrained by the manual curation of existing simulators. To address this, we introduce RoomTour3D, a video-instruction dataset derived from web-based room tour videos that capture real-world indoor spaces and human walking demonstrations. Unlike existing VLN datasets, RoomTour3D leverages the scale and diversity of online videos to generate open-ended human walking trajectories and open-world navigable instructions. To compensate for the lack of navigation data in online videos, we perform 3D reconstruction and obtain 3D trajectories of walking paths augmented with additional information on the room types, object locations and 3D shape of surrounding scenes. Our dataset includes $\sim$100K open-ended description-enriched trajectories with $\sim$200K instructions, and 17K action-enriched trajectories from 1847 room tour environments. We demonstrate experimentally that RoomTour3D enables significant improvements across multiple VLN tasks including CVDN, SOON, R2R, and REVERIE. Moreover, RoomTour3D facilitates the development of trainable zero-shot VLN agents, showcasing the potential and challenges of advancing towards open-world navigation.</p></details> | CVPR2025 |
| **[HA-VLN: A Benchmark for Human-Aware Navigation in Discrete-Continuous Environments with Dynamic Multi-Human Interactions, Real-World Validation, and an Open Leaderboard](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14229v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) systems often focus on either discrete (panoramic) or continuous (free-motion) paradigms alone, overlooking the complexities of human-populated, dynamic environments. We introduce a unified Human-Aware VLN (HA-VLN) benchmark that merges these paradigms under explicit social-awareness constraints. Our contributions include: 1. A standardized task definition that balances discrete-continuous navigation with personal-space requirements; 2. An enhanced human motion dataset (HAPS 2.0) and upgraded simulators capturing realistic multi-human interactions, outdoor contexts, and refined motion-language alignment; 3. Extensive benchmarking on 16,844 human-centric instructions, revealing how multi-human dynamics and partial observability pose substantial challenges for leading VLN agents; 4. Real-world robot tests validating sim-to-real transfer in crowded indoor spaces; and 5. A public leaderboard supporting transparent comparisons across discrete and continuous tasks. Empirical results show improved navigation success and fewer collisions when social context is integrated, underscoring the need for human-centric design. By releasing all datasets, simulators, agent code, and evaluation tools, we aim to advance safer, more capable, and socially responsible VLN research.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, website: https://ha-vln-project.vercel.app/</p></details> |
| **[FlexVLN: Flexible Adaptation for Diverse Vision-and-Language Navigation Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13966v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The aspiration of the Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) task has long been to develop an embodied agent with robust adaptability, capable of seamlessly transferring its navigation capabilities across various tasks. Despite remarkable advancements in recent years, most methods necessitate dataset-specific training, thereby lacking the capability to generalize across diverse datasets encompassing distinct types of instructions. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional reasoning and generalization abilities, exhibiting immense potential in robot action planning. In this paper, we propose FlexVLN, an innovative hierarchical approach to VLN that integrates the fundamental navigation ability of a supervised-learning-based Instruction Follower with the robust generalization ability of the LLM Planner, enabling effective generalization across diverse VLN datasets. Moreover, a verification mechanism and a multi-model integration mechanism are proposed to mitigate potential hallucinations by the LLM Planner and enhance execution accuracy of the Instruction Follower. We take REVERIE, SOON, and CVDN-target as out-of-domain datasets for assessing generalization ability. The generalization performance of FlexVLN surpasses that of all the previous methods to a large extent.</p></details> |  |
| **[Counterfactual Vision-and-Language Navigation via Adversarial Path Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.07308v4)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is a task where agents must decide how to move through a 3D environment to reach a goal by grounding natural language instructions to the visual surroundings. One of the problems of the VLN task is data scarcity since it is difficult to collect enough navigation paths with human-annotated instructions for interactive environments. In this paper, we explore the use of counterfactual thinking as a human-inspired data augmentation method that results in robust models. Counterfactual thinking is a concept that describes the human propensity to create possible alternatives to life events that have already occurred. We propose an adversarial-driven counterfactual reasoning model that can consider effective conditions instead of low-quality augmented data. In particular, we present a model-agnostic adversarial path sampler (APS) that learns to sample challenging paths that force the navigator to improve based on the navigation performance. APS also serves to do pre-exploration of unseen environments to strengthen the model's ability to generalize. We evaluate the influence of APS on the performance of different VLN baseline models using the room-to-room dataset (R2R). The results show that the adversarial training process with our proposed APS benefits VLN models under both seen and unseen environments. And the pre-exploration process can further gain additional improvements under unseen environments.</p></details> | ECCV'20 (Spotlight) |
| **[UnitedVLN: Generalizable Gaussian Splatting for Continuous Vision-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16053v2)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN), where an agent follows instructions to reach a target destination, has recently seen significant advancements. In contrast to navigation in discrete environments with predefined trajectories, VLN in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) presents greater challenges, as the agent is free to navigate any unobstructed location and is more vulnerable to visual occlusions or blind spots. Recent approaches have attempted to address this by imagining future environments, either through predicted future visual images or semantic features, rather than relying solely on current observations. However, these RGB-based and feature-based methods lack intuitive appearance-level information or high-level semantic complexity crucial for effective navigation. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel, generalizable 3DGS-based pre-training paradigm, called UnitedVLN, which enables agents to better explore future environments by unitedly rendering high-fidelity 360 visual images and semantic features. UnitedVLN employs two key schemes: search-then-query sampling and separate-then-united rendering, which facilitate efficient exploitation of neural primitives, helping to integrate both appearance and semantic information for more robust navigation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UnitedVLN outperforms state-of-the-art methods on existing VLN-CE benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Aerial Vision-and-Language Navigation with Grid-based View Selection and Map Construction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11091v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aerial Vision-and-Language Navigation (Aerial VLN) aims to obtain an unmanned aerial vehicle agent to navigate aerial 3D environments following human instruction. Compared to ground-based VLN, aerial VLN requires the agent to decide the next action in both horizontal and vertical directions based on the first-person view observations. Previous methods struggle to perform well due to the longer navigation path, more complicated 3D scenes, and the neglect of the interplay between vertical and horizontal actions. In this paper, we propose a novel grid-based view selection framework that formulates aerial VLN action prediction as a grid-based view selection task, incorporating vertical action prediction in a manner that accounts for the coupling with horizontal actions, thereby enabling effective altitude adjustments. We further introduce a grid-based bird's eye view map for aerial space to fuse the visual information in the navigation history, provide contextual scene information, and mitigate the impact of obstacles. Finally, a cross-modal transformer is adopted to explicitly align the long navigation history with the instruction. We demonstrate the superiority of our method in extensive experiments.</p></details> | Under Submission |
| **[Observation-Graph Interaction and Key-Detail Guidance for Vision and Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11006v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision and Language Navigation (VLN) requires an agent to navigate through environments following natural language instructions. However, existing methods often struggle with effectively integrating visual observations and instruction details during navigation, leading to suboptimal path planning and limited success rates. In this paper, we propose OIKG (Observation-graph Interaction and Key-detail Guidance), a novel framework that addresses these limitations through two key components: (1) an observation-graph interaction module that decouples angular and visual information while strengthening edge representations in the navigation space, and (2) a key-detail guidance module that dynamically extracts and utilizes fine-grained location and object information from instructions. By enabling more precise cross-modal alignment and dynamic instruction interpretation, our approach significantly improves the agent's ability to follow complex navigation instructions. Extensive experiments on the R2R and RxR datasets demonstrate that OIKG achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple evaluation metrics, validating the effectiveness of our method in enhancing navigation precision through better observation-instruction alignment.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |
| **[SmartWay: Enhanced Waypoint Prediction and Backtracking for Zero-Shot Vision-and-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10069v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) in continuous environments requires agents to interpret natural language instructions while navigating unconstrained 3D spaces. Existing VLN-CE frameworks rely on a two-stage approach: a waypoint predictor to generate waypoints and a navigator to execute movements. However, current waypoint predictors struggle with spatial awareness, while navigators lack historical reasoning and backtracking capabilities, limiting adaptability. We propose a zero-shot VLN-CE framework integrating an enhanced waypoint predictor with a Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based navigator. Our predictor employs a stronger vision encoder, masked cross-attention fusion, and an occupancy-aware loss for better waypoint quality. The navigator incorporates history-aware reasoning and adaptive path planning with backtracking, improving robustness. Experiments on R2R-CE and MP3D benchmarks show our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in zero-shot settings, demonstrating competitive results compared to fully supervised methods. Real-world validation on Turtlebot 4 further highlights its adaptability.</p></details> |  |
| **[PanoGen++: Domain-Adapted Text-Guided Panoramic Environment Generation for Vision-and-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09938v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-language navigation (VLN) tasks require agents to navigate three-dimensional environments guided by natural language instructions, offering substantial potential for diverse applications. However, the scarcity of training data impedes progress in this field. This paper introduces PanoGen++, a novel framework that addresses this limitation by generating varied and pertinent panoramic environments for VLN tasks. PanoGen++ incorporates pre-trained diffusion models with domain-specific fine-tuning, employing parameter-efficient techniques such as low-rank adaptation to minimize computational costs. We investigate two settings for environment generation: masked image inpainting and recursive image outpainting. The former maximizes novel environment creation by inpainting masked regions based on textual descriptions, while the latter facilitates agents' learning of spatial relationships within panoramas. Empirical evaluations on room-to-room (R2R), room-for-room (R4R), and cooperative vision-and-dialog navigation (CVDN) datasets reveal significant performance enhancements: a 2.44% increase in success rate on the R2R test leaderboard, a 0.63% improvement on the R4R validation unseen set, and a 0.75-meter enhancement in goal progress on the CVDN validation unseen set. PanoGen++ augments the diversity and relevance of training environments, resulting in improved generalization and efficacy in VLN tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted by Neural Networks</p></details> |
| **[NavRAG: Generating User Demand Instructions for Embodied Navigation through Retrieval-Augmented LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11142v3)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is an essential skill for embodied agents, allowing them to navigate in 3D environments following natural language instructions. High-performance navigation models require a large amount of training data, the high cost of manually annotating data has seriously hindered this field. Therefore, some previous methods translate trajectory videos into step-by-step instructions for expanding data, but such instructions do not match well with users' communication styles that briefly describe destinations or state specific needs. Moreover, local navigation trajectories overlook global context and high-level task planning. To address these issues, we propose NavRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework that generates user demand instructions for VLN. NavRAG leverages LLM to build a hierarchical scene description tree for 3D scene understanding from global layout to local details, then simulates various user roles with specific demands to retrieve from the scene tree, generating diverse instructions with LLM. We annotate over 2 million navigation instructions across 861 scenes and evaluate the data quality and navigation performance of trained models.</p></details> |  |

However, generalization remains a persistent challenge, particularly when dealing with visually diverse scenes or transitioning from simulated environments to real-world deployment. In this paper, we address the mismatch between human-centric instructions and quadruped robots with a low-height field of view, proposing a Ground-level Viewpoint Navigation (GVNav) approach to mitigate this issue. This work represents the first attempt to highlight the generalization gap in VLN across varying heights of visual observation in realistic robot deployments. Our approach leverages weighted historical observations as enriched spatiotemporal contexts for instruction following, effectively managing feature collisions within cells by assigning appropriate weights to identical features across different viewpoints. This enables low-height robots to overcome challenges such as visual obstructions and perceptual mismatches. Additionally, we transfer the connectivity graph from the HM3D and Gibson datasets as an extra resource to enhance spatial priors and a more comprehensive representation of real-world scenarios, leading to improved performance and generalizability of the waypoint predictor in real-world environments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our Ground-level Viewpoint Navigation (GVnav) approach significantly improves performance in both simulated environments and real-world deployments with quadruped robots.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICRA 2025</p></details> |

Traditional approaches rely heavily on historical observations as spatio-temporal contexts for decision making, leading to significant storage and computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce MapNav, a novel end-to-end VLN model that leverages Annotated Semantic Map (ASM) to replace historical frames. Specifically, our approach constructs a top-down semantic map at the start of each episode and update it at each timestep, allowing for precise object mapping and structured navigation information. Then, we enhance this map with explicit textual labels for key regions, transforming abstract semantics into clear navigation cues and generate our ASM. MapNav agent using the constructed ASM as input, and use the powerful end-to-end capabilities of VLM to empower VLN. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MapNav achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in both simulated and real-world environments, validating the effectiveness of our method. Moreover, we will release our ASM generation source code and dataset to ensure reproducibility, contributing valuable resources to the field. We believe that our proposed MapNav can be used as a new memory representation method in VLN, paving the way for future research in this field.</p></details> |  |

However, it is non-trivial to translate human language instructions all the way to low-level leg joint actions. We propose NaVILA, a 2-level framework that unifies a Vision-Language-Action model (VLA) with locomotion skills. Instead of directly predicting low-level actions from VLA, NaVILA first generates mid-level actions with spatial information in the form of language, (e.g., "moving forward 75cm"), which serves as an input for a visual locomotion RL policy for execution. NaVILA substantially improves previous approaches on existing benchmarks. The same advantages are demonstrated in our newly developed benchmarks with IsaacLab, featuring more realistic scenes, low-level controls, and real-world robot experiments.

Given navigation instruction in natural language, we first prompt LLM to extract the landmarks and the order in which they are visited. Assuming the known model of the environment, we retrieve the top-k locations of the last landmark and generate $k$ path hypotheses from the starting location to the last landmark using the shortest path algorithm on the topological map of the environment. Each path hypothesis is represented by a sequence of panoramas. We then use dynamic programming to compute the alignment score between the sequence of panoramas and the sequence of landmark names, which match scores obtained from VLM. Finally, we compute the nDTW metric between the hypothesis that yields the highest alignment score to evaluate the path fidelity. We demonstrate superior performance compared to other approaches that use joint semantic maps like VLMaps \cite{vlmaps} on the complex R2R-Habitat \cite{r2r} instruction dataset and quantify in detail the effect of visual grounding on navigation performance.</p></details> |  |

Traditional approaches use supervised learning methods, relying heavily on domain-specific datasets to train VLN models. Recent methods try to utilize closed-source large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 to solve VLN tasks in zero-shot manners, but face challenges related to expensive token costs and potential data breaches in real-world applications. In this work, we introduce Open-Nav, a novel study that explores open-source LLMs for zero-shot VLN in the continuous environment. Open-Nav employs a spatial-temporal chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning approach to break down tasks into instruction comprehension, progress estimation, and decision-making. It enhances scene perceptions with fine-grained object and spatial knowledge to improve LLM's reasoning in navigation. Our extensive experiments in both simulated and real-world environments demonstrate that Open-Nav achieves competitive performance compared to using closed-source LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICRA 2025</p></details> |
| **[General Scene Adaptation for Vision-and-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17403v1)** | 2025-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) tasks mainly evaluate agents based on one-time execution of individual instructions across multiple environments, aiming to develop agents capable of functioning in any environment in a zero-shot manner. However, real-world navigation robots often operate in persistent environments with relatively consistent physical layouts, visual observations, and language styles from instructors. Such a gap in the task setting presents an opportunity to improve VLN agents by incorporating continuous adaptation to specific environments. To better reflect these real-world conditions, we introduce GSA-VLN, a novel task requiring agents to execute navigation instructions within a specific scene and simultaneously adapt to it for improved performance over time. To evaluate the proposed task, one has to address two challenges in existing VLN datasets: the lack of OOD data, and the limited number and style diversity of instructions for each scene. Therefore, we propose a new dataset, GSA-R2R, which significantly expands the diversity and quantity of environments and instructions for the R2R dataset to evaluate agent adaptability in both ID and OOD contexts. Furthermore, we design a three-stage instruction orchestration pipeline that leverages LLMs to refine speaker-generated instructions and apply role-playing techniques to rephrase instructions into different speaking styles. This is motivated by the observation that each individual user often has consistent signatures or preferences in their instructions. We conducted extensive experiments on GSA-R2R to thoroughly evaluate our dataset and benchmark various methods. Based on our findings, we propose a novel method, GR-DUET, which incorporates memory-based navigation graphs with an environment-specific training strategy, achieving state-of-the-art results on all GSA-R2R splits.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

While LLMs excel in general conversation scenarios, they struggle with specialized navigation tasks, yielding suboptimal performance compared to specialized VLN models. We introduce FLAME (FLAMingo-Architected Embodied Agent), a novel Multimodal LLM-based agent and architecture designed for urban VLN tasks that efficiently handles multiple observations. Our approach implements a three-phase tuning technique for effective adaptation to navigation tasks, including single perception tuning for street view description, multiple perception tuning for route summarization, and end-to-end training on VLN datasets. The augmented datasets are synthesized automatically. Experimental results demonstrate FLAME's superiority over existing methods, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by a 7.3% increase in task completion on Touchdown dataset.

Detection and Localization of Instruction Errors in Vision-and-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10700v2)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) is one of the most intuitive yet challenging embodied AI tasks. Agents are tasked to navigate towards a target goal by executing a set of low-level actions, following a series of natural language instructions. All VLN-CE methods in the literature assume that language instructions are exact. However, in practice, instructions given by humans can contain errors when describing a spatial environment due to inaccurate memory or confusion. Current VLN-CE benchmarks do not address this scenario, making the state-of-the-art methods in VLN-CE fragile in the presence of erroneous instructions from human users. For the first time, we propose a novel benchmark dataset that introduces various types of instruction errors considering potential human causes. This benchmark provides valuable insight into the robustness of VLN systems in continuous environments. We observe a noticeable performance drop (up to -25%) in Success Rate when evaluating the state-of-the-art VLN-CE methods on our benchmark. Moreover, we formally define the task of Instruction Error Detection and Localization, and establish an evaluation protocol on top of our benchmark dataset. We also propose an effective method, based on a cross-modal transformer architecture, that achieves the best performance in error detection and localization, compared to baselines. Surprisingly, our proposed method has revealed errors in the validation set of the two commonly used datasets for VLN-CE, i.e., R2R-CE and RxR-CE, demonstrating the utility of our technique in other tasks.

This study presents the first-ever work in Arabic language integration within the Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) domain in robotics, an area that has been notably underexplored in existing research. We perform a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art multi-lingual Small Language Models (SLMs), including GPT-4o mini, Llama 3 8B, and Phi-3 medium 14B, alongside the Arabic-centric LLM, Jais. Our approach utilizes the NavGPT framework, a pure LLM-based instruction-following navigation agent, to assess the impact of language on navigation reasoning through zero-shot sequential action prediction using the R2R dataset. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that our framework is capable of high-level planning for navigation tasks when provided with instructions in both English and Arabic. However, certain models struggled with reasoning and planning in the Arabic language due to inherent limitations in their capabilities, sub-optimal performance, and parsing issues. These findings highlight the importance of enhancing planning and reasoning capabilities in language models for effective navigation, emphasizing this as a key area for further development while also unlocking the potential of Arabic-language models for impactful real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

Developing an imaginative memory system inspired by human mechanisms can enhance the navigation performance of embodied agents in unseen environments. However, existing Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) agents lack a memory mechanism of this kind. To address this, we propose a novel architecture that equips agents with a reality-imagination hybrid memory system. This system enables agents to maintain and expand their memory through both imaginative mechanisms and navigation actions. Additionally, we design tailored pre-training tasks to develop the agent's imaginative capabilities. Our agent can imagine high-fidelity RGB images for future scenes, achieving state-of-the-art result in Success rate weighted by Path Length (SPL).</p></details> |  |
| **[Continual Vision-and-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15049v2)** | 2024-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In developing Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) agents that navigate to a destination using natural language instructions and visual cues, current studies largely assume a \textit{train-once-deploy-once strategy}. We argue that this kind of strategy is less realistic, as deployed VLN agents are expected to encounter novel environments continuously through their lifetime. To facilitate more realistic setting for VLN agents, we propose Continual Vision-and-Language Navigation (CVLN) paradigm for agents to continually learn and adapt to changing environments. In CVLN, the agents are trained and evaluated incrementally across multiple \textit{scene domains} (i.e., environments). We present two CVLN learning setups to consider diverse forms of natural language instructions: Initial-instruction based CVLN, focused on navigation via initial-instruction interpretation, and dialogue-based CVLN, designed for navigation through dialogue with other agents. We introduce two simple yet effective baseline methods, tailored to the sequential decision-making needs of CVLN: Perplexity Replay (PerpR) and Episodic Self-Replay (ESR), both employing a rehearsal mechanism. PerpR selects replay episodes based on episode difficulty, while ESR stores and revisits action logits from individual episode steps during training to refine learning. Experimental results indicate that while existing continual learning methods are insufficient for CVLN, PerpR and ESR outperform the comparison methods by effectively utilizing replay memory.</p></details> |  |

The paper introduces four core, cognitively motivated and linguistically grounded, navigation concepts and an algorithm for generating large-scale silver annotations of naturally occurring linguistic realizations of these concepts in navigation instructions. We pair the annotated instructions with video clips of an agent acting on these instructions. NAVCON contains 236, 316 concept annotations for approximately 30, 0000 instructions and 2.7 million aligned images (from approximately 19, 000 instructions) showing what the agent sees when executing an instruction. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive resource of navigation concepts. We evaluated the quality of the silver annotations by conducting human evaluation studies on NAVCON samples. As further validation of the quality and usefulness of the resource, we trained a model for detecting navigation concepts and their linguistic realizations in unseen instructions. Additionally, we show that few-shot learning with GPT-4o performs well on this task using large-scale silver annotations of NAVCON.</p></details> |  |
| **[World-Consistent Data Generation for Vision-and-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06413v1)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is a challenging task that requires an agent to navigate through photorealistic environments following natural-language instructions. One main obstacle existing in VLN is data scarcity, leading to poor generalization performance over unseen environments. Tough data argumentation is a promising way for scaling up the dataset, how to generate VLN data both diverse and world-consistent remains problematic. To cope with this issue, we propose the world-consistent data generation (WCGEN), an efficacious data-augmentation framework satisfying both diversity and world-consistency, targeting at enhancing the generalizations of agents to novel environments. Roughly, our framework consists of two stages, the trajectory stage which leverages a point-cloud based technique to ensure spatial coherency among viewpoints, and the viewpoint stage which adopts a novel angle synthesis method to guarantee spatial and wraparound consistency within the entire observation. By accurately predicting viewpoint changes with 3D knowledge, our approach maintains the world-consistency during the generation procedure. Experiments on a wide range of datasets verify the effectiveness of our method, demonstrating that our data augmentation strategy enables agents to achieve new state-of-the-art results on all navigation tasks, and is capable of enhancing the VLN agents' generalization ability to unseen environments.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we consider how this benefit might be hijacked by local modifications in the appearance of the agent's operating environment. Specifically, we take the popular Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) task as a representative setting and develop a whitebox adversarial attack that optimizes a 3D attack object's appearance to induce desired behaviors in pretrained VLN agents that observe it in the environment. We demonstrate that the proposed attack can cause VLN agents to ignore their instructions and execute alternative actions after encountering the attack object -- even for instructions and agent paths not considered when optimizing the attack. For these novel settings, we find our attacks can induce early-termination behaviors or divert an agent along an attacker-defined multi-step trajectory. Under both conditions, environmental attacks significantly reduce agent capabilities to successfully follow user instructions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by WACV 2025</p></details> |

Current approaches use contrastive learning to align language with visual trajectory sequences. Nevertheless, they encounter difficulties with fine-grained vision negatives. To enhance cross-modal embeddings, we introduce a novel Bayesian Optimization-based adversarial optimization framework for creating fine-grained contrastive vision samples. To validate the proposed methodology, we conduct a series of experiments to assess the effectiveness of the enriched embeddings on fine-grained vision negatives. We conduct experiments on two common VLN benchmarks R2R and REVERIE, experiments on the them demonstrate that these embeddings benefit navigation, and can lead to a promising performance enhancement.

Our g3D-LF processes posed RGB-D images from agents to encode feature fields for: 1) Novel view representation predictions from any position in the 3D scene; 2) Generations of BEV maps centered on the agent; 3) Querying targets using multi-granularity language within the above-mentioned representations. Our representation can be generalized to unseen environments, enabling real-time construction and dynamic updates. By volume rendering latent features along sampled rays and integrating semantic and spatial relationships through multiscale encoders, our g3D-LF produces representations at different scales and perspectives, aligned with multi-granularity language, via multi-level contrastive learning. Furthermore, we prepare a large-scale 3D-language dataset to align the representations of the feature fields with language. Extensive experiments on Vision-and-Language Navigation under both Panorama and Monocular settings, Zero-shot Object Navigation, and Situated Question Answering tasks highlight the significant advantages and effectiveness of our g3D-LF for embodied tasks.</p></details> |  |

Most existing methods for constructing realistic navigation scenes have high costs, and the extension of instructions mainly relies on predefined templates or rules, lacking adaptability. To alleviate the issue, we propose InstruGen, a VLN path-instruction pairs generation paradigm. Specifically, we use YouTube house tour videos as realistic navigation scenes and leverage the powerful visual understanding and generation abilities of large multimodal models (LMMs) to automatically generate diverse and high-quality VLN path-instruction pairs. Our method generates navigation instructions with different granularities and achieves fine-grained alignment between instructions and visual observations, which was difficult to achieve with previous methods. Additionally, we design a multi-stage verification mechanism to reduce hallucinations and inconsistency of LMMs. Experimental results demonstrate that agents trained with path-instruction pairs generated by InstruGen achieves state-of-the-art performance on the R2R and RxR benchmarks, particularly in unseen environments.

| **[NavAgent: Multi-scale Urban Street View Fusion For UAV Embodied Vision-and-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08579v1)** | 2024-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN), as a widely discussed research direction in embodied intelligence, aims to enable embodied agents to navigate in complicated visual environments through natural language commands. Most existing VLN methods focus on indoor ground robot scenarios. However, when applied to UAV VLN in outdoor urban scenes, it faces two significant challenges. First, urban scenes contain numerous objects, which makes it challenging to match fine-grained landmarks in images with complex textual descriptions of these landmarks. Second, overall environmental information encompasses multiple modal dimensions, and the diversity of representations significantly increases the complexity of the encoding process. To address these challenges, we propose NavAgent, the first urban UAV embodied navigation model driven by a large Vision-Language Model. NavAgent undertakes navigation tasks by synthesizing multi-scale environmental information, including topological maps (global), panoramas (medium), and fine-grained landmarks (local). Specifically, we utilize GLIP to build a visual recognizer for landmark capable of identifying and linguisticizing fine-grained landmarks. Subsequently, we develop dynamically growing scene topology map that integrate environmental information and employ Graph Convolutional Networks to encode global environmental data. In addition, to train the visual recognizer for landmark, we develop NavAgent-Landmark2K, the first fine-grained landmark dataset for real urban street scenes. In experiments conducted on the Touchdown and Map2seq datasets, NavAgent outperforms strong baseline models. The code and dataset will be released to the community to facilitate the exploration and development of outdoor VLN.</p></details> |  |

Detecting Absence of Information in Vision and Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05831v1)** | 2024-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research in Vision Language Navigation (VLN) has overlooked the development of agents' inquisitive abilities, which allow them to ask clarifying questions when instructions are incomplete. This paper addresses how agents can recognize "when" they lack sufficient information, without focusing on "what" is missing, particularly in VLN tasks with vague instructions. Equipping agents with this ability enhances efficiency by reducing potential digressions and seeking timely assistance. The challenge in identifying such uncertain points is balancing between being overly cautious (high recall) and overly confident (high precision). We propose an attention-based instruction-vagueness estimation module that learns associations between instructions and the agent's trajectory. By leveraging instruction-to-path alignment information during training, the module's vagueness estimation performance improves by around 52% in terms of precision-recall balance. In our ablative experiments, we also demonstrate the effectiveness of incorporating this additional instruction-to-path attention network alongside the cross-modal attention networks within the navigator module. Our results show that the attention scores from the instruction-to-path attention network serve as better indicators for estimating vagueness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at WACV 2025</p></details> |

A comprehensive evaluation, including metrics considering human activities, and systematic analysis of HA-VLN's unique challenges, underscores the need for further research to enhance HA-VLN agents' real-world robustness and adaptability.

In this field, the agent is usually trained and evaluated in the navigation simulators, lacking effective approaches for sim-to-real transfer. The VLN agents with only a monocular camera exhibit extremely limited performance, while the mainstream VLN models trained with panoramic observation, perform better but are difficult to deploy on most monocular robots. For this case, we propose a sim-to-real transfer approach to endow the monocular robots with panoramic traversability perception and panoramic semantic understanding, thus smoothly transferring the high-performance panoramic VLN models to the common monocular robots. In this work, the semantic traversable map is proposed to predict agent-centric navigable waypoints, and the novel view representations of these navigable waypoints are predicted through the 3D feature fields. These methods broaden the limited field of view of the monocular robots and significantly improve navigation performance in the real world. Our VLN system outperforms previous SOTA monocular VLN methods in R2R-CE and RxR-CE benchmarks within the simulation environments and is also validated in real-world environments, providing a practical and high-performance solution for real-world VLN.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CoRL 2024.

Further, this map is transformed into a matrix representation with distance metrics as the text prompt to the LLM, for action prediction according to the instruction.

VLN-CM is composed of four modules and predicts the direction and distance of the next movement at each step. We utilize large foundation models for each modules. To select the direction, we use the Attention Spot Predictor (ASP), View Selector (VS), and Progress Monitor (PM). The ASP employs a Large Language Model (e.g. ChatGPT) to split navigation instructions into attention spots, which are objects or scenes at the location to move to (e.g. a yellow door). The VS selects from panorama images provided at 30-degree intervals the one that includes the attention spot, using CLIP similarity. We then choose the angle of the selected image as the direction to move in. The PM uses a rule-based approach to decide which attention spot to focus on next, among multiple spots derived from the instructions. If the similarity between the current attention spot and the visual observations decreases consecutively at each step, the PM determines that the agent has passed the current spot and moves on to the next one. For selecting the distance to move, we employed the Open Map Predictor (OMP). The OMP uses panorama depth information to predict an occupancy mask. We then selected a collision-free distance in the predicted direction based on the occupancy mask. We evaluated our method using the validation data of VLN-CE. Our approach showed better performance than several baseline methods, and the OPM was effective in mitigating collisions for the agent.</p></details> |  |

To address this issue, we propose a Hierarchical Spatial Proximity Reasoning (HSPR) method. First, we introduce a scene understanding auxiliary task to help the agent build a knowledge base of hierarchical spatial proximity. This task utilizes panoramic views and object features to identify types of nodes and uncover the adjacency relationships between nodes, objects, and between nodes and objects. Second, we propose a multi-step reasoning navigation algorithm based on the hierarchical spatial proximity knowledge base, which continuously plans feasible paths to enhance exploration efficiency. Third, we introduce a residual fusion method to improve navigation decision accuracy.

Despite notable advancements in ground-level navigation, the exploration of aerial navigation using these modalities remains limited. This gap primarily arises from a lack of suitable resources for real-world, city-scale aerial navigation studies. To remedy this gap, we introduce CityNav, a novel dataset explicitly designed for language-guided aerial navigation in photorealistic 3D environments of real cities. CityNav comprises 32k natural language descriptions paired with human demonstration trajectories, collected via a newly developed web-based 3D simulator. Each description identifies a navigation goal, utilizing the names and locations of landmarks within actual cities. As an initial step toward addressing this challenge, we provide baseline models of navigation agents that incorporate an internal 2D spatial map representing landmarks referenced in the descriptions. We have benchmarked the latest aerial navigation methods alongside our proposed baseline model on the CityNav dataset.

To address this challenge, we aim to achieve both high model performance and practical deployability. Specifically, we focus on Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN), a core task in Embodied AI. This paper introduces a two-stage knowledge distillation framework, producing a student model, MiniVLN, and showcasing the significant potential of distillation techniques in developing lightweight models. The proposed method aims to capture fine-grained knowledge during the pretraining phase and navigation-specific knowledge during the fine-tuning phase. Our findings indicate that the two-stage distillation approach is more effective in narrowing the performance gap between the teacher model and the student model compared to single-stage distillation. On the public R2R and REVERIE benchmarks, MiniVLN achieves performance on par with the teacher model while having only about 12% of the teacher model's parameter count.</p></details> |  |

Such a trend underscores the potential of LLMs to generalize navigational reasoning and diverse language understanding. However, a significant discrepancy in agent performance is observed when integrating LLMs in the Vision-and-Language navigation (VLN) tasks compared to previous downstream specialist models. Furthermore, the inherent capacity of language to interpret and facilitate communication in agent interactions is often underutilized in these integrations. In this work, we strive to bridge the divide between VLN-specialized models and LLM-based navigation paradigms, while maintaining the interpretative prowess of LLMs in generating linguistic navigational reasoning. By aligning visual content in a frozen LLM, we encompass visual observation comprehension for LLMs and exploit a way to incorporate LLMs and navigation policy networks for effective action predictions and navigational reasoning. We demonstrate the data efficiency of the proposed methods and eliminate the gap between LM-based agents and state-of-the-art VLN specialists.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ECCV 2024</p></details> |

Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) is an embodied navigation task, where a robot navigates within a previously seen and unseen environment, based on linguistic instruction and visual inputs. VLN agents need access to both local and global action spaces; former for immediate decision making and the latter for recovering from navigational mistakes. Prior VLN agents rely only on instruction-viewpoint alignment for local and global decision making and back-track to a previously visited viewpoint, if the instruction and its current viewpoint mismatches. These methods are prone to mistakes, due to the complexity of the instruction and partial observability of the environment. We posit that, back-tracking is sub-optimal and agent that is aware of its mistakes can recover efficiently. For optimal recovery, exploration should be extended to unexplored viewpoints (or frontiers). The optimal frontier is a recently observed but unexplored viewpoint that aligns with the instruction and is novel. We introduce a memory-based and mistake-aware path planning strategy for VLN agents, called \textit{StratXplore}, that presents global and local action planning to select the optimal frontier for path correction. The proposed method collects all past actions and viewpoint features during navigation and then selects the optimal frontier suitable for recovery. Experimental results show this simple yet effective strategy improves the success rate on two VLN datasets with different task complexities.</p></details> |  |

On this front, we study the task of generating highly detailed navigational instructions for the embodied robots to follow. Although recent studies have demonstrated significant leaps in the generation of step-by-step instructions from sequences of images, the generated instructions lack variety in terms of their referral to objects and landmarks. Existing speaker models learn strategies to evade the evaluation metrics and obtain higher scores even for low-quality sentences. In this work, we propose SAS (Spatially-Aware Speaker), an instruction generator or \textit{Speaker} model that utilises both structural and semantic knowledge of the environment to produce richer instructions. For training, we employ a reward learning method in an adversarial setting to avoid systematic bias introduced by language evaluation metrics. Empirically, our method outperforms existing instruction generation models, evaluated using standard metrics. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/gmuraleekrishna/SAS}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Narrowing the Gap between Vision and Action in Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10388v1)** | 2024-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The existing methods for Vision and Language Navigation in the Continuous Environment (VLN-CE) commonly incorporate a waypoint predictor to discretize the environment. This simplifies the navigation actions into a view selection task and improves navigation performance significantly compared to direct training using low-level actions. However, the VLN-CE agents are still far from the real robots since there are gaps between their visual perception and executed actions. First, VLN-CE agents that discretize the visual environment are primarily trained with high-level view selection, which causes them to ignore crucial spatial reasoning within the low-level action movements. Second, in these models, the existing waypoint predictors neglect object semantics and their attributes related to passibility, which can be informative in indicating the feasibility of actions. To address these two issues, we introduce a low-level action decoder jointly trained with high-level action prediction, enabling the current VLN agent to learn and ground the selected visual view to the low-level controls. Moreover, we enhance the current waypoint predictor by utilizing visual representations containing rich semantic information and explicitly masking obstacles based on humans' prior knowledge about the feasibility of actions. Empirically, our agent can improve navigation performance metrics compared to the strong baselines on both high-level and low-level actions.</p></details> |  |

While learning-based approaches have been a major solution to the task, they suffer from high training costs and lack of interpretability. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising tool for VLN due to their strong generalization capabilities. However, existing LLM-based methods face limitations in memory construction and diversity of navigation strategies. To address these challenges, we propose a suite of techniques. Firstly, we introduce a method to maintain a topological map that stores navigation history, retaining information about viewpoints, objects, and their spatial relationships. This map also serves as a global action space. Additionally, we present a Navigation Chain of Thoughts module, leveraging human navigation examples to enrich navigation strategy diversity. Finally, we establish a pipeline that integrates navigational memory and strategies with perception and action prediction modules. Experimental results on the REVERIE and R2R datasets show that our method effectively enhances the navigation ability of the LLM and improves the interpretability of navigation reasoning.</p></details> |  |

To alleviate this problem, previous works mainly focus on grounding the natural language to the visual input, but neglecting the crucial role of the agent's spatial position information in the grounding process. In this work, we first explore the substantial effect of spatial position locating on the grounding of outdoor VLN, drawing inspiration from human navigation. In real-world navigation scenarios, before planning a path to the destination, humans typically need to figure out their current location. This observation underscores the pivotal role of spatial localization in the navigation process. In this work, we introduce a novel framework, Locating be for Planning (Loc4Plan), designed to incorporate spatial perception for action planning in outdoor VLN tasks. The main idea behind Loc4Plan is to perform the spatial localization before planning a decision action based on corresponding guidance, which comprises a block-aware spatial locating (BAL) module and a spatial-aware action planning (SAP) module. Specifically, to help the agent perceive its spatial location in the environment, we propose to learn a position predictor that measures how far the agent is from the next intersection for reflecting its position, which is achieved by the BAL module. After the locating process, we propose the SAP module to incorporate spatial information to ground the corresponding guidance and enhance the precision of action planning. Extensive experiments on the Touchdown and map2seq datasets show that the proposed Loc4Plan outperforms the SOTA methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2203.13838 by other authors</p></details> |
| **[Navigating Beyond Instructions: Vision-and-Language Navigation in Obstructed Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21452v1)** | 2024-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world navigation often involves dealing with unexpected obstructions such as closed doors, moved objects, and unpredictable entities. However, mainstream Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) tasks typically assume instructions perfectly align with the fixed and predefined navigation graphs without any obstructions. This assumption overlooks potential discrepancies in actual navigation graphs and given instructions, which can cause major failures for both indoor and outdoor agents. To address this issue, we integrate diverse obstructions into the R2R dataset by modifying both the navigation graphs and visual observations, introducing an innovative dataset and task, R2R with UNexpected Obstructions (R2R-UNO). R2R-UNO contains various types and numbers of path obstructions to generate instruction-reality mismatches for VLN research. Experiments on R2R-UNO reveal that state-of-the-art VLN methods inevitably encounter significant challenges when facing such mismatches, indicating that they rigidly follow instructions rather than navigate adaptively. Therefore, we propose a novel method called ObVLN (Obstructed VLN), which includes a curriculum training strategy and virtual graph construction to help agents effectively adapt to obstructed environments. Empirical results show that ObVLN not only maintains robust performance in unobstructed scenarios but also achieves a substantial performance advantage with unexpected obstructions.</p></details> | Accepted to MM 2024 |
| **[PRET: Planning with Directed Fidelity Trajectory for Vision and Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11487v1)** | 2024-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision and language navigation is a task that requires an agent to navigate according to a natural language instruction. Recent methods predict sub-goals on constructed topology map at each step to enable long-term action planning. However, they suffer from high computational cost when attempting to support such high-level predictions with GCN-like models. In this work, we propose an alternative method that facilitates navigation planning by considering the alignment between instructions and directed fidelity trajectories, which refers to a path from the initial node to the candidate locations on a directed graph without detours. This planning strategy leads to an efficient model while achieving strong performance. Specifically, we introduce a directed graph to illustrate the explored area of the environment, emphasizing directionality. Then, we firstly define the trajectory representation as a sequence of directed edge features, which are extracted from the panorama based on the corresponding orientation. Ultimately, we assess and compare the alignment between instruction and different trajectories during navigation to determine the next navigation target. Our method outperforms previous SOTA method BEVBert on RxR dataset and is comparable on R2R dataset while largely reducing the computational cost.

Existing approaches have made enormous progress in navigation in new environments, such as beam search, pre-exploration, and dynamic or hierarchical history encoding. To balance generalization and efficiency, we resort to memorizing visited scenarios apart from the ongoing route while navigating. In this work, we introduce a mechanism of Episodic Scene memory (ESceme) for VLN that wakes an agent's memories of past visits when it enters the current scene. The episodic scene memory allows the agent to envision a bigger picture of the next prediction. This way, the agent learns to utilize dynamically updated information instead of merely adapting to the current observations. We provide a simple yet effective implementation of ESceme by enhancing the accessible views at each location and progressively completing the memory while navigating. We verify the superiority of ESceme on short-horizon (R2R), long-horizon (R4R), and vision-and-dialog (CVDN) VLN tasks. Our ESceme also wins first place on the CVDN leaderboard.

In this field, generalization is a long-standing challenge, either to out-of-distribution scenes or from Sim to Real. In this paper, we propose NaVid, a video-based large vision language model (VLM), to mitigate such a generalization gap. NaVid makes the first endeavor to showcase the capability of VLMs to achieve state-of-the-art level navigation performance without any maps, odometers, or depth inputs. Following human instruction, NaVid only requires an on-the-fly video stream from a monocular RGB camera equipped on the robot to output the next-step action. Our formulation mimics how humans navigate and naturally gets rid of the problems introduced by odometer noises, and the Sim2Real gaps from map or depth inputs. Moreover, our video-based approach can effectively encode the historical observations of robots as spatio-temporal contexts for decision making and instruction following. We train NaVid with 510k navigation samples collected from continuous environments, including action-planning and instruction-reasoning samples, along with 763k large-scale web data. Extensive experiments show that NaVid achieves state-of-the-art performance in simulation environments and the real world, demonstrating superior cross-dataset and Sim2Real transfer. We thus believe our proposed VLM approach plans the next step for not only the navigation agents but also this research field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Robotics: Science and Systems (RSS 2024)</p></details> |

However, performance substantially drops in new environments with no training data. Using opensource descriptions paired with coordinates (e.g., Wikipedia) provides training data but suffers from limited spatially-oriented text resulting in low geolocation resolution. We propose a large-scale augmentation method for generating high-quality synthetic data for new environments using readily available geospatial data. Our method constructs a grounded knowledge-graph, capturing entity relationships. Sampled entities and relations (`shop north of school') generate navigation instructions via (i) generating numerous templates using context-free grammar (CFG) to embed specific entities and relations; (ii) feeding the entities and relation into a large language model (LLM) for instruction generation. A comprehensive evaluation on RVS, showed that our approach improves the 100-meter accuracy by 45.83% on unseen environments. Furthermore, we demonstrate that models trained with CFG-based augmentation achieve superior performance compared with those trained with LLM-based augmentation, both in unseen and seen environments. These findings suggest that the potential advantages of explicitly structuring spatial information for text-based geospatial reasoning in previously unknown, can unlock data-scarce scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Towards the Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) task, a core task in E-AI, this paper reveals the great potential of using knowledge distillation for obtaining lightweight student models by proposing a Meta-Ability Guided Interactive Chain-of-distillation (MAGIC) method. Specifically, a Meta-Ability Knowledge Distillation (MAKD) framework is proposed for decoupling and refining the necessary meta-abilities of VLN agents. A Meta-Knowledge Randomization Weighting (MKRW) and a Meta-Knowledge Transferable Determination (MKTD) module are incorporated to dynamically adjust aggregation weights at the meta-ability and sample levels, respectively. Move beyond the traditional one-step unidirectional distillation, an Interactive Chain-of-Distillation (ICoD) learning strategy is proposed to allow students to give feedback to teachers, forming a new multi-step teacher-student co-evolution pipeline. Remarkably, on the R2R test unseen public leaderboard, our smallest model, MAGIC-S, with only 5% (11M) of the teacher's size, outperforms all previous methods under the same training data. Additionally, our largest model, MAGIC-L, surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by 5.84% in SPL and 3.18% in SR. Furthermore, a new dataset was collected and annotated from our living environments, where MAGIC-S demonstrated superior performance and real-time efficiency.

However, most existing methods do not address the likely case where users may make mistakes when providing such instruction (e.g. "turn left" instead of "turn right"). In this work, we address a novel task of Interactive VLN in Continuous Environments (IVLN-CE), which allows the agent to interact with the user during the VLN-CE navigation to verify any doubts regarding the instruction errors. We propose an Interactive Instruction Error Detector and Localizer (I2EDL) that triggers the user-agent interaction upon the detection of instruction errors during the navigation. We leverage a pre-trained module to detect instruction errors and pinpoint them in the instruction by cross-referencing the textual input and past observations. In such way, the agent is able to query the user for a timely correction, without demanding the user's cognitive load, as we locate the probable errors to a precise part of the instruction. We evaluate the proposed I2EDL on a dataset of instructions containing errors, and further devise a novel metric, the Success weighted by Interaction Number (SIN), to reflect both the navigation performance and the interaction effectiveness. We show how the proposed method can ask focused requests for corrections to the user, which in turn increases the navigation success, while minimizing the interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE RO-MAN 2024</p></details> |

However, existing zero-shot agents for vision-and-language navigation (VLN) only prompt GPT-4 to select potential locations within localized environments, without constructing an effective "global-view" for the agent to understand the overall environment. In this work, we present a novel map-guided GPT-based agent, dubbed MapGPT, which introduces an online linguistic-formed map to encourage global exploration. Specifically, we build an online map and incorporate it into the prompts that include node information and topological relationships, to help GPT understand the spatial environment. Benefiting from this design, we further propose an adaptive planning mechanism to assist the agent in performing multi-step path planning based on a map, systematically exploring multiple candidate nodes or sub-goals step by step. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our MapGPT is applicable to both GPT-4 and GPT-4V, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on R2R and REVERIE simultaneously (~10% and ~12% improvements in SR), and showcasing the newly emergent global thinking and path planning abilities of the GPT.</p></details> | <details><summary>LLM/V...</summary><p>LLM/VLM-based VLN Agents.

However, being inherently abstract, the same textual instruction can be associated with different visual signals, causing severe ambiguity and limiting the transfer of prior knowledge in the vision domain from the user to the agent. To fill this gap, we propose Vision-and-Language Navigation with Multi-modal Prompts (VLN-MP), a novel task augmenting traditional VLN by integrating both natural language and images in instructions. VLN-MP not only maintains backward compatibility by effectively handling text-only prompts but also consistently shows advantages with different quantities and relevance of visual prompts. Possible forms of visual prompts include both exact and similar object images, providing adaptability and versatility in diverse navigation scenarios. To evaluate VLN-MP under a unified framework, we implement a new benchmark that offers: (1) a training-free pipeline to transform textual instructions into multi-modal forms with landmark images; (2) diverse datasets with multi-modal instructions for different downstream tasks; (3) a novel module designed to process various image prompts for seamless integration with state-of-the-art VLN models. Extensive experiments on four VLN benchmarks (R2R, RxR, REVERIE, CVDN) show that incorporating visual prompts significantly boosts navigation performance. While maintaining efficiency with text-only prompts, VLN-MP enables agents to navigate in the pre-explore setting and outperform text-based models, showing its broader applicability.</p></details> | IJCAI 2024 |

Most of the existing methods employ the entire image or object features to represent navigable viewpoints. However, these representations are insufficient for proper action prediction, especially for the REVERIE task, which uses concise high-level instructions, such as ''Bring me the blue cushion in the master bedroom''. To address enhancing representation, we propose an augmented commonsense knowledge model (ACK) to leverage commonsense information as a spatio-temporal knowledge graph for improving agent navigation. Specifically, the proposed approach involves constructing a knowledge base by retrieving commonsense information from ConceptNet, followed by a refinement module to remove noisy and irrelevant knowledge. We further present ACK which consists of knowledge graph-aware cross-modal and concept aggregation modules to enhance visual representation and visual-textual data alignment by integrating visible objects, commonsense knowledge, and concept history, which includes object and knowledge temporal information. Moreover, we add a new pipeline for the commonsense-based decision-making process which leads to more accurate local action prediction. Experimental results demonstrate our proposed model noticeably outperforms the baseline and archives the state-of-the-art on the REVERIE benchmark.</p></details> |  |

Enabling the agent to adhere to instructions throughout the process of navigation represents a significant challenge within the domain of VLN. To address this challenge, common approaches often rely on encoders to explicitly record past locations and actions, increasing model complexity and resource consumption. Our proposal, the Vision-and-Language Navigation Generative Pretrained Transformer (VLN-GPT), adopts a transformer decoder model (GPT2) to model trajectory sequence dependencies, bypassing the need for historical encoding modules. This method allows for direct historical information access through trajectory sequence, enhancing efficiency. Furthermore, our model separates the training process into offline pre-training with imitation learning and online fine-tuning with reinforcement learning. This distinction allows for more focused training objectives and improved performance. Performance assessments on the VLN dataset reveal that VLN-GPT surpasses complex state-of-the-art encoder-based models.</p></details> |  |

Such agents are typically required to execute user instructions in an online manner, leading us to explore the use of unlabeled test samples for effective online model adaptation. However, for online Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN), due to the intrinsic nature of inter-sample online instruction execution and intra-sample multi-step action decision, frequent updates can result in drastic changes in model parameters, while occasional updates can make the model ill-equipped to handle dynamically changing environments. Therefore, we propose a Fast-Slow Test-Time Adaptation (FSTTA) approach for online VLN by performing joint decomposition-accumulation analysis for both gradients and parameters in a unified framework.

The navigation abilities of the agent can be enhanced by the relations between objects, which are usually learned using internal objects or external datasets. The relationships between internal objects are modeled employing graph convolutional network (GCN) in traditional studies. However, GCN tends to be shallow, limiting its modeling ability. To address this issue, we utilize a cross attention mechanism to learn the connections between objects over a trajectory, which takes temporal continuity into account, termed as Temporal Object Relations (TOR). The external datasets have a gap with the navigation environment, leading to inaccurate modeling of relations. To avoid this problem, we construct object connections based on observations from all viewpoints in the navigational environment, which ensures complete spatial coverage and eliminates the gap, called Spatial Object Relations (SOR). Additionally, we observe that agents may repeatedly visit the same location during navigation, significantly hindering their performance. For resolving this matter, we introduce the Turning Back Penalty (TBP) loss function, which penalizes the agent's repetitive visiting behavior, substantially reducing the navigational distance. Experimental results on the REVERIE, SOON, and R2R datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces the generalized cross-modal causal transformer (GOAT), a pioneering solution rooted in the paradigm of causal inference. By delving into both observable and unobservable confounders within vision, language, and history, we propose the back-door and front-door adjustment causal learning (BACL and FACL) modules to promote unbiased learning by comprehensively mitigating potential spurious correlations. Additionally, to capture global confounder features, we propose a cross-modal feature pooling (CFP) module supervised by contrastive learning, which is also shown to be effective in improving cross-modal representations during pre-training. Extensive experiments across multiple VLN datasets (R2R, REVERIE, RxR, and SOON) underscore the superiority of our proposed method over previous state-of-the-art approaches.

VLN is a challenging task that involves an agent following human instructions and navigating in a previously unknown environment to reach a specified goal. Recent work in literature focuses on different ways to augment the available datasets of instructions for improving navigation performance by exploiting synthetic training data. In this work, we propose AIGeN, a novel architecture inspired by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) that produces meaningful and well-formed synthetic instructions to improve navigation agents' performance. The model is composed of a Transformer decoder (GPT-2) and a Transformer encoder (BERT). During the training phase, the decoder generates sentences for a sequence of images describing the agent's path to a particular point while the encoder discriminates between real and fake instructions. Experimentally, we evaluate the quality of the generated instructions and perform extensive ablation studies. Additionally, we generate synthetic instructions for 217K trajectories using AIGeN on Habitat-Matterport 3D Dataset (HM3D) and show an improvement in the performance of an off-the-shelf VLN method.

The significant potential of VLN-CE for mobile robots has been demonstrated across a large number of studies. However, most existing works in VLN-CE focus primarily on transferring the standard discrete vision-and-language navigation (VLN) methods to continuous environments, overlooking the problem of collisions. Such oversight often results in the agent deviating from the planned path or, in severe instances, the agent being trapped in obstacle areas and failing the navigational task. To address the above-mentioned issues, this paper investigates various collision scenarios within VLN-CE and proposes a classification method to predicate the underlying causes of collisions. Furthermore, a new VLN-CE algorithm, named Safe-VLN, is proposed to bolster collision avoidance capabilities including two key components, i.e., a waypoint predictor and a navigator. In particular, the waypoint predictor leverages a simulated 2D LiDAR occupancy mask to prevent the predicted waypoints from being situated in obstacle-ridden areas. The navigator, on the other hand, employs the strategy of `re-selection after collision' to prevent the robot agent from becoming ensnared in a cycle of perpetual collisions. The proposed Safe-VLN is evaluated on the R2R-CE, the results of which demonstrate an enhanced navigational performance and a statistically significant reduction in collision incidences.</p></details> |  |
| **[DELAN: Dual-Level Alignment for Vision-and-Language Navigation by Cross-Modal Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01994v1)** | 2024-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-Language navigation (VLN) requires an agent to navigate in unseen environment by following natural language instruction. For task completion, the agent needs to align and integrate various navigation modalities, including instruction, observation and navigation history. Existing works primarily concentrate on cross-modal attention at the fusion stage to achieve this objective. Nevertheless, modality features generated by disparate uni-encoders reside in their own spaces, leading to a decline in the quality of cross-modal fusion and decision. To address this problem, we propose a Dual-levEL AligNment (DELAN) framework by cross-modal contrastive learning. This framework is designed to align various navigation-related modalities before fusion, thereby enhancing cross-modal interaction and action decision-making. Specifically, we divide the pre-fusion alignment into dual levels: instruction-history level and landmark-observation level according to their semantic correlations. We also reconstruct a dual-level instruction for adaptation to the dual-level alignment. As the training signals for pre-fusion alignment are extremely limited, self-supervised contrastive learning strategies are employed to enforce the matching between different modalities. Our approach seamlessly integrates with the majority of existing models, resulting in improved navigation performance on various VLN benchmarks, including R2R, R4R, RxR and CVDN.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by LREC-COLING 2024</p></details> |

At each navigation step, the agent selects from possible candidate locations and then makes the move. For better navigation planning, the lookahead exploration strategy aims to effectively evaluate the agent's next action by accurately anticipating the future environment of candidate locations. To this end, some existing works predict RGB images for future environments, while this strategy suffers from image distortion and high computational cost. To address these issues, we propose the pre-trained hierarchical neural radiance representation model (HNR) to produce multi-level semantic features for future environments, which are more robust and efficient than pixel-wise RGB reconstruction. Furthermore, with the predicted future environmental representations, our lookahead VLN model is able to construct the navigable future path tree and select the optimal path via efficient parallel evaluation. Extensive experiments on the VLN-CE datasets confirm the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2024.

| **[LangNav: Language as a Perceptual Representation for Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07889v2)** | 2024-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We explore the use of language as a perceptual representation for vision-and-language navigation (VLN), with a focus on low-data settings. Our approach uses off-the-shelf vision systems for image captioning and object detection to convert an agent's egocentric panoramic view at each time step into natural language descriptions. We then finetune a pretrained language model to select an action, based on the current view and the trajectory history, that would best fulfill the navigation instructions. In contrast to the standard setup which adapts a pretrained language model to work directly with continuous visual features from pretrained vision models, our approach instead uses (discrete) language as the perceptual representation. We explore several use cases of our language-based navigation (LangNav) approach on the R2R VLN benchmark: generating synthetic trajectories from a prompted language model (GPT-4) with which to finetune a smaller language model; domain transfer where we transfer a policy learned on one simulated environment (ALFRED) to another (more realistic) environment (R2R); and combining both vision- and language-based representations for VLN. Our approach is found to improve upon baselines that rely on visual features in settings where only a few expert trajectories (10-100) are available, demonstrating the potential of language as a perceptual representation for navigation.</p></details> |  |
| **[IVLMap: Instance-Aware Visual Language Grounding for Consumer Robot Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19336v1)** | 2024-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is a challenging task that requires a robot to navigate in photo-realistic environments with human natural language promptings. Recent studies aim to handle this task by constructing the semantic spatial map representation of the environment, and then leveraging the strong ability of reasoning in large language models for generalizing code for guiding the robot navigation. However, these methods face limitations in instance-level and attribute-level navigation tasks as they cannot distinguish different instances of the same object. To address this challenge, we propose a new method, namely, Instance-aware Visual Language Map (IVLMap), to empower the robot with instance-level and attribute-level semantic mapping, where it is autonomously constructed by fusing the RGBD video data collected from the robot agent with special-designed natural language map indexing in the bird's-in-eye view. Such indexing is instance-level and attribute-level. In particular, when integrated with a large language model, IVLMap demonstrates the capability to i) transform natural language into navigation targets with instance and attribute information, enabling precise localization, and ii) accomplish zero-shot end-to-end navigation tasks based on natural language commands. Extensive navigation experiments are conducted. Simulation results illustrate that our method can achieve an average improvement of 14.4\% in navigation accuracy. Code and demo are released at https://ivlmap.github.io/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling Vision-and-Language Navigation With Offline RL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18454v1)** | 2024-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The study of vision-and-language navigation (VLN) has typically relied on expert trajectories, which may not always be available in real-world situations due to the significant effort required to collect them. On the other hand, existing approaches to training VLN agents that go beyond available expert data involve data augmentations or online exploration which can be tedious and risky. In contrast, it is easy to access large repositories of suboptimal offline trajectories. Inspired by research in offline reinforcement learning (ORL), we introduce a new problem setup of VLN-ORL which studies VLN using suboptimal demonstration data. We introduce a simple and effective reward-conditioned approach that can account for dataset suboptimality for training VLN agents, as well as benchmarks to evaluate progress and promote research in this area. We empirically study various noise models for characterizing dataset suboptimality among other unique challenges in VLN-ORL and instantiate it for the VLN$\circlearrowright$BERT and MTVM architectures in the R2R and RxR environments. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed reward-conditioned approach leads to significant performance improvements, even in complex and intricate environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (04/2024)</p></details> |

Although the long-term memory aligns better with the persistent nature of the VLN task, it poses more challenges on how to utilize the highly unstructured navigation memory with extremely sparse supervision. Towards this end, we propose OVER-NAV, which aims to go over and beyond the current arts of IVLN techniques. In particular, we propose to incorporate LLMs and open-vocabulary detectors to distill key information and establish correspondence between multi-modal signals. Such a mechanism introduces reliable cross-modal supervision and enables on-the-fly generalization to unseen scenes without the need of extra annotation and re-training. To fully exploit the interpreted navigation data, we further introduce a structured representation, coded Omnigraph, to effectively integrate multi-modal information along the tour. Accompanied with a novel omnigraph fusion mechanism, OVER-NAV is able to extract the most relevant knowledge from omnigraph for a more accurate navigating action. In addition, OVER-NAV seamlessly supports both discrete and continuous environments under a unified framework. We demonstrate the superiority of OVER-NAV in extensive experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2024</p></details> |

Towards Building Robust Embodied Agents under Federated Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14769v4)** | 2024-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated embodied agent learning protects the data privacy of individual visual environments by keeping data locally at each client (the individual environment) during training. However, since the local data is inaccessible to the server under federated learning, attackers may easily poison the training data of the local client to build a backdoor in the agent without notice. Deploying such an agent raises the risk of potential harm to humans, as the attackers may easily navigate and control the agent as they wish via the backdoor. Towards Byzantine-robust federated embodied agent learning, in this paper, we study the attack and defense for the task of vision-and-language navigation (VLN), where the agent is required to follow natural language instructions to navigate indoor environments. First, we introduce a simple but effective attack strategy, Navigation as Wish (NAW), in which the malicious client manipulates local trajectory data to implant a backdoor into the global model. Results on two VLN datasets (R2R and RxR) show that NAW can easily navigate the deployed VLN agent regardless of the language instruction, without affecting its performance on normal test sets. Then, we propose a new Prompt-Based Aggregation (PBA) to defend against the NAW attack in federated VLN, which provides the server with a ''prompt'' of the vision-and-language alignment variance between the benign and malicious clients so that they can be distinguished during training. We validate the effectiveness of the PBA method on protecting the global model from the NAW attack, which outperforms other state-of-the-art defense methods by a large margin in the defense metrics on R2R and RxR.</p></details> |  |
| **[Language to Map: Topological map generation from natural language path instructions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10008v1)** | 2024-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, a method for generating a map from path information described using natural language (textual path) is proposed. In recent years, robotics research mainly focus on vision-and-language navigation (VLN), a navigation task based on images and textual paths. Although VLN is expected to facilitate user instructions to robots, its current implementation requires users to explain the details of the path for each navigation session, which results in high explanation costs for users. To solve this problem, we proposed a method that creates a map as a topological map from a textual path and automatically creates a new path using this map. We believe that large language models (LLMs) can be used to understand textual path. Therefore, we propose and evaluate two methods, one for storing implicit maps in LLMs, and the other for generating explicit maps using LLMs. The implicit map is in the LLM's memory. It is created using prompts. In the explicit map, a topological map composed of nodes and edges is constructed and the actions at each node are stored. This makes it possible to estimate the path and actions at waypoints on an undescribed path, if enough information is available. Experimental results on path instructions generated in a real environment demonstrate that generating explicit maps achieves significantly higher accuracy than storing implicit maps in the LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 7 figures.

These environments often include obstacles and pedestrians, making it essential for autonomous agents to possess the capability of self-corrected planning to adjust their actions based on feedback from the surroundings. However, the majority of existing vision-and-language navigation (VLN) methods primarily operate in less realistic simulator settings and do not incorporate environmental feedback into their decision-making processes. To address this gap, we introduce a novel zero-shot framework called CorNav, utilizing a large language model for decision-making and comprising two key components: 1) incorporating environmental feedback for refining future plans and adjusting its actions, and 2) multiple domain experts for parsing instructions, scene understanding, and refining predicted actions. In addition to the framework, we develop a 3D simulator that renders realistic scenarios using Unreal Engine 5. To evaluate the effectiveness and generalization of navigation agents in a zero-shot multi-task setting, we create a benchmark called NavBench. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CorNav consistently outperforms all baselines by a significant margin across all tasks. On average, CorNav achieves a success rate of 28.1\%, surpassing the best baseline's performance of 20.5\%.</p></details> | 22 pages |
| **[Towards Deviation-Robust Agent Navigation via Perturbation-Aware Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05770v1)** | 2024-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-language navigation (VLN) asks an agent to follow a given language instruction to navigate through a real 3D environment. Despite significant advances, conventional VLN agents are trained typically under disturbance-free environments and may easily fail in real-world scenarios, since they are unaware of how to deal with various possible disturbances, such as sudden obstacles or human interruptions, which widely exist and may usually cause an unexpected route deviation. In this paper, we present a model-agnostic training paradigm, called Progressive Perturbation-aware Contrastive Learning (PROPER) to enhance the generalization ability of existing VLN agents, by requiring them to learn towards deviation-robust navigation. Specifically, a simple yet effective path perturbation scheme is introduced to implement the route deviation, with which the agent is required to still navigate successfully following the original instruction. Since directly enforcing the agent to learn perturbed trajectories may lead to inefficient training, a progressively perturbed trajectory augmentation strategy is designed, where the agent can self-adaptively learn to navigate under perturbation with the improvement of its navigation performance for each specific trajectory. For encouraging the agent to well capture the difference brought by perturbation, a perturbation-aware contrastive learning mechanism is further developed by contrasting perturbation-free trajectory encodings and perturbation-based counterparts. Extensive experiments on R2R show that PROPER can benefit multiple VLN baselines in perturbation-free scenarios. We further collect the perturbed path data to construct an introspection subset based on the R2R, called Path-Perturbed R2R (PP-R2R). The results on PP-R2R show unsatisfying robustness of popular VLN agents and the capability of PROPER in improving the navigation robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TPAMI 2023</p></details> |

However, existing VLN methods struggle with the issue of spurious associations, resulting in poor generalization with a significant performance gap between seen and unseen environments. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by proposing a unified framework CausalVLN based on the causal learning paradigm to train a robust navigator capable of learning unbiased feature representations. Specifically, we establish reasonable assumptions about confounders for vision and language in VLN using the structured causal model (SCM). Building upon this, we propose an iterative backdoor-based representation learning (IBRL) method that allows for the adaptive and effective intervention on confounders. Furthermore, we introduce the visual and linguistic backdoor causal encoders to enable unbiased feature expression for multi-modalities during training and validation, enhancing the agent's capability to generalize across different environments. Experiments on three VLN datasets (R2R, RxR, and REVERIE) showcase the superiority of our proposed method over previous state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, detailed visualization analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of CausalVLN in significantly narrowing down the performance gap between seen and unseen environments, underscoring its strong generalization capability.</p></details> | 16 pages |

The performance of existing VLN methods is limited by insufficient diversity in navigation environments and limited training data. To address these issues, we propose VLN-Video, which utilizes the diverse outdoor environments present in driving videos in multiple cities in the U.S. augmented with automatically generated navigation instructions and actions to improve outdoor VLN performance. VLN-Video combines the best of intuitive classical approaches and modern deep learning techniques, using template infilling to generate grounded navigation instructions, combined with an image rotation similarity-based navigation action predictor to obtain VLN style data from driving videos for pretraining deep learning VLN models. We pre-train the model on the Touchdown dataset and our video-augmented dataset created from driving videos with three proxy tasks: Masked Language Modeling, Instruction and Trajectory Matching, and Next Action Prediction, so as to learn temporally-aware and visually-aligned instruction representations. The learned instruction representation is adapted to the state-of-the-art navigator when fine-tuning on the Touchdown dataset. Empirical results demonstrate that VLN-Video significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art models by 2.1% in task completion rate, achieving a new state-of-the-art on the Touchdown dataset.</p></details> | AAAI 2024 |

In our work, we provide indirect supervision to the navigation agent through a hint generator that provides detailed visual descriptions. The hint generator assists the navigation agent in developing a global understanding of the visual environment. It directs the agent's attention toward related navigation details, including the relevant sub-instruction, potential challenges in recognition and ambiguities in grounding, and the targeted viewpoint description. To train the hint generator, we construct a synthetic dataset based on landmarks in the instructions and visible and distinctive objects in the visual environment. We evaluate our method on the R2R and R4R datasets and achieve state-of-the-art on several metrics. The experimental results demonstrate that generating hints not only enhances the navigation performance but also helps improve the interpretability of the agent's actions.</p></details> |  |

One particularly demanding scenario is Vision and Language Navigation~(VLN) which requires visual and natural language understanding as well as spatial and temporal reasoning capabilities. The embodied agent needs to ground its understanding of navigation instructions in observations of a real-world environment like Street View. Despite the impressive results of LLMs in other research areas, it is an ongoing problem of how to best connect them with an interactive visual environment. In this work, we propose VELMA, an embodied LLM agent that uses a verbalization of the trajectory and of visual environment observations as contextual prompt for the next action. Visual information is verbalized by a pipeline that extracts landmarks from the human written navigation instructions and uses CLIP to determine their visibility in the current panorama view. We show that VELMA is able to successfully follow navigation instructions in Street View with only two in-context examples. We further finetune the LLM agent on a few thousand examples and achieve 25%-30% relative improvement in task completion over the previous state-of-the-art for two datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2024</p></details> |

With strong representation capabilities, pretrained vision-and-language models are widely used in VLN. However, most of them are trained on web-crawled general-purpose datasets, which incurs a considerable domain gap when used for VLN tasks. To address the problem, we propose a novel and model-agnostic domain-aware prompt learning (DAP) framework. For equipping the pretrained models with specific object-level and scene-level cross-modal alignment in VLN tasks, DAP applies a low-cost prompt tuning paradigm to learn soft visual prompts for extracting in-domain image semantics. Specifically, we first generate a set of in-domain image-text pairs with the help of the CLIP model. Then we introduce soft visual prompts in the input space of the visual encoder in a pretrained model. DAP injects in-domain visual knowledge into the visual encoder of the pretrained model in an efficient way. Experimental results on both R2R and REVERIE show the superiority of DAP compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2309.03661</p></details> |

We recognise a promising opportunity to extend VLN to a comparable navigation task that holds substantial significance in our daily lives, albeit within the virtual realm: navigating websites on the Internet. This paper proposes a new task named Vision-and-Language Navigation on Websites (WebVLN), where we use question-based instructions to train an agent, emulating how users naturally browse websites. Unlike the existing VLN task that only pays attention to vision and instruction (language), the WebVLN agent further considers underlying web-specific content like HTML, which could not be seen on the rendered web pages yet contains rich visual and textual information. Toward this goal, we contribute a dataset, WebVLN-v1, and introduce a novel approach called Website-aware VLN Network (WebVLN-Net), which is built upon the foundation of state-of-the-art VLN techniques. Experimental results show that WebVLN-Net outperforms current VLN and web-related navigation methods. We believe that the introduction of the new WebVLN task and its dataset will establish a new dimension within the VLN domain and contribute to the broader vision-and-language research community.

Existing Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) benchmarks erase the agent's memory at the beginning of every episode, testing the ability to perform cold-start navigation with no prior information. However, deployed robots occupy the same environment for long periods of time. The IVLN paradigm addresses this disparity by training and evaluating VLN agents that maintain memory across tours of scenes that consist of up to 100 ordered instruction-following Room-to-Room (R2R) episodes, each defined by an individual language instruction and a target path. We present discrete and continuous Iterative Room-to-Room (IR2R) benchmarks comprising about 400 tours each in 80 indoor scenes. We find that extending the implicit memory of high-performing transformer VLN agents is not sufficient for IVLN, but agents that build maps can benefit from environment persistence, motivating a renewed focus on map-building agents in VLN.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2023</p></details> |

However, they are not sensitive to indoor scenarios for VLN tasks. Another challenge for VLN is how the agent understands the contextual relations between actions on a path and performs cross-modal alignment sequentially. In this paper, we propose a novel Prompt-bAsed coNtext- and inDoor-Aware (PANDA) pretraining framework to address these problems. It performs prompting in two stages. In the indoor-aware stage, we apply an efficient tuning paradigm to learn deep visual prompts from an indoor dataset, in order to augment pretrained models with inductive biases towards indoor environments. This can enable more sample-efficient adaptation for VLN agents. Furthermore, in the context-aware stage, we design a set of hard context prompts to capture the sequence-level semantics in the instruction. They enable further tuning of the pretrained models via contrastive learning. Experimental results on both R2R and REVERIE show the superiority of PANDA compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 12 pages |

For agents to complete this task successfully, they must be able to ground objects referenced into the instruction (e.g.`piano') into the visual scene as well as ground directional phrases (e.g.`turn left') into actions. In this work we ask the following question -- to what degree are spatial and directional language cues informing the navigation model's decisions? We propose a series of simple masking experiments to inspect the model's reliance on different parts of the instruction. Surprisingly we uncover that certain top performing models rely only on the noun tokens of the instructions. We propose two training methods to alleviate this concerning limitation.</p></details> |  |

Such a trend underscored the potential of training LLMs with unlimited language data, advancing the development of a universal embodied agent. In this work, we introduce the NavGPT, a purely LLM-based instruction-following navigation agent, to reveal the reasoning capability of GPT models in complex embodied scenes by performing zero-shot sequential action prediction for vision-and-language navigation (VLN). At each step, NavGPT takes the textual descriptions of visual observations, navigation history, and future explorable directions as inputs to reason the agent's current status, and makes the decision to approach the target. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate NavGPT can explicitly perform high-level planning for navigation, including decomposing instruction into sub-goal, integrating commonsense knowledge relevant to navigation task resolution, identifying landmarks from observed scenes, tracking navigation progress, and adapting to exceptions with plan adjustment. Furthermore, we show that LLMs is capable of generating high-quality navigational instructions from observations and actions along a path, as well as drawing accurate top-down metric trajectory given the agent's navigation history. Despite the performance of using NavGPT to zero-shot R2R tasks still falling short of trained models, we suggest adapting multi-modality inputs for LLMs to use as visual navigation agents and applying the explicit reasoning of LLMs to benefit learning-based models.</p></details> |  |

Enhancing them with the ability to follow instructions in natural language will further improve navigation efficiency in unseen cases. However, state-of-the-art (SOTA) vision-and-language navigation (VLN) methods are mainly evaluated in simulation, neglecting the complex and noisy real world. Directly transferring SOTA navigation policies trained in simulation to the real world is challenging due to the visual domain gap and the absence of prior knowledge about unseen environments. In this work, we propose a novel navigation framework to address the VLN task in the real world. Utilizing the powerful foundation models, the proposed framework includes four key components: (1) an LLMs-based instruction parser that converts the language instruction into a sequence of pre-defined macro-action descriptions, (2) an online visual-language mapper that builds a real-time visual-language map to maintain a spatial and semantic understanding of the unseen environment, (3) a language indexing-based localizer that grounds each macro-action description into a waypoint location on the map, and (4) a DD-PPO-based local controller that predicts the action. We evaluate the proposed pipeline on an Interbotix LoCoBot WX250 in an unseen lab environment. Without any fine-tuning, our pipeline significantly outperforms the SOTA VLN baseline in the real world.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating Explanation Methods for Vision-and-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06654v1)** | 2023-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to navigate robots with natural language instructions in an unknown environment is a crucial step for achieving embodied artificial intelligence (AI). With the improving performance of deep neural models proposed in the field of vision-and-language navigation (VLN), it is equally interesting to know what information the models utilize for their decision-making in the navigation tasks. To understand the inner workings of deep neural models, various explanation methods have been developed for promoting explainable AI (XAI). But they are mostly applied to deep neural models for image or text classification tasks and little work has been done in explaining deep neural models for VLN tasks. In this paper, we address these problems by building quantitative benchmarks to evaluate explanation methods for VLN models in terms of faithfulness. We propose a new erasure-based evaluation pipeline to measure the step-wise textual explanation in the sequential decision-making setting. We evaluate several explanation methods for two representative VLN models on two popular VLN datasets and reveal valuable findings through our experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECAI 2023</p></details> |

Moreover, natural language contains complex semantic information thus its correlations with visual inputs are hard to model merely with cross attention. In this paper, we propose GeoVLN, which learns Geometry-enhanced visual representation based on slot attention for robust Visual-and-Language Navigation. The RGB images are compensated with the corresponding depth maps and normal maps predicted by Omnidata as visual inputs. Technically, we introduce a two-stage module that combine local slot attention and CLIP model to produce geometry-enhanced representation from such input. We employ V&L BERT to learn a cross-modal representation that incorporate both language and vision informations. Additionally, a novel multiway attention module is designed, encouraging different phrases of input instruction to exploit the most related features from visual input. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our newly designed modules and show the compelling performance of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2023</p></details> |

Most existing studies concentrate on mapping the global instruction or single sub-instruction to the corresponding trajectory. However, another critical problem of achieving fine-grained alignment at the entity level is seldom considered. To address this problem, we propose a novel Grounded Entity-Landmark Adaptive (GELA) pre-training paradigm for VLN tasks. To achieve the adaptive pre-training paradigm, we first introduce grounded entity-landmark human annotations into the Room-to-Room (R2R) dataset, named GEL-R2R. Additionally, we adopt three grounded entity-landmark adaptive pre-training objectives: 1) entity phrase prediction, 2) landmark bounding box prediction, and 3) entity-landmark semantic alignment, which explicitly supervise the learning of fine-grained cross-modal alignment between entity phrases and environment landmarks. Finally, we validate our model on two downstream benchmarks: VLN with descriptive instructions (R2R) and dialogue instructions (CVDN). The comprehensive experiments show that our GELA model achieves state-of-the-art results on both tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness and generalizability.</p></details> | ICCV 2023 Oral |

To represent the previously visited environment, most approaches for VLN implement memory using recurrent states, topological maps, or top-down semantic maps. In contrast to these approaches, we build the top-down egocentric and dynamically growing Grid Memory Map (i.e., GridMM) to structure the visited environment. From a global perspective, historical observations are projected into a unified grid map in a top-down view, which can better represent the spatial relations of the environment. From a local perspective, we further propose an instruction relevance aggregation method to capture fine-grained visual clues in each grid region. Extensive experiments are conducted on both the REVERIE, R2R, SOON datasets in the discrete environments, and the R2R-CE dataset in the continuous environments, showing the superiority of our proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2023.

This task involves the prediction of a sequence of actions that leads to a specified destination given a natural language navigation instruction. The task thus requires the understanding of instructions, such as ``Walk out of the bathroom and wait on the stairs that are on the right''. The Visual and Language Navigation remains challenging, notably because it requires the exploration of the environment and at the accurate following of a path specified by the instructions to model the relationship between language and vision. To address this, we propose the CrossMap Transformer network, which encodes the linguistic and visual features to sequentially generate a path. The CrossMap transformer is tied to a Transformer-based speaker that generates navigation instructions. The two networks share common latent features, for mutual enhancement through a double back translation model: Generated paths are translated into instructions while generated instructions are translated into path The experimental results show the benefits of our approach in terms of instruction understanding and instruction generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables.

However, full fine-tuning the pre-trained model for every downstream VLN task is becoming costly due to the considerable model size. Recent research hotspot of Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning (PETL) shows great potential in efficiently tuning large pre-trained models for the common CV and NLP tasks, which exploits the most of the representation knowledge implied in the pre-trained model while only tunes a minimal set of parameters. However, simply utilizing existing PETL methods for the more challenging VLN tasks may bring non-trivial degeneration to the performance. Therefore, we present the first study to explore PETL methods for VLN tasks and propose a VLN-specific PETL method named VLN-PETL. Specifically, we design two PETL modules: Historical Interaction Booster (HIB) and Cross-modal Interaction Booster (CIB). Then we combine these two modules with several existing PETL methods as the integrated VLN-PETL. Extensive experimental results on four mainstream VLN tasks (R2R, REVERIE, NDH, RxR) demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed VLN-PETL, where VLN-PETL achieves comparable or even better performance to full fine-tuning and outperforms other PETL methods with promising margins.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2023</p></details> |
| **[March in Chat: Interactive Prompting for Remote Embodied Referring Expression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10141v1)** | 2023-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) tasks have been proposed in recent years, from room-based to object-based and indoor to outdoor. The REVERIE (Remote Embodied Referring Expression) is interesting since it only provides high-level instructions to the agent, which are closer to human commands in practice. Nevertheless, this poses more challenges than other VLN tasks since it requires agents to infer a navigation plan only based on a short instruction. Large Language Models (LLMs) show great potential in robot action planning by providing proper prompts. Still, this strategy has not been explored under the REVERIE settings. There are several new challenges. For example, the LLM should be environment-aware so that the navigation plan can be adjusted based on the current visual observation. Moreover, the LLM planned actions should be adaptable to the much larger and more complex REVERIE environment. This paper proposes a March-in-Chat (MiC) model that can talk to the LLM on the fly and plan dynamically based on a newly proposed Room-and-Object Aware Scene Perceiver (ROASP). Our MiC model outperforms the previous state-of-the-art by large margins by SPL and RGSPL metrics on the REVERIE benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2023</p></details> |
| **[History Aware Multimodal Transformer for Vision-and-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.13309v2)** | 2023-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-language navigation (VLN) aims to build autonomous visual agents that follow instructions and navigate in real scenes. To remember previously visited locations and actions taken, most approaches to VLN implement memory using recurrent states. Instead, we introduce a History Aware Multimodal Transformer (HAMT) to incorporate a long-horizon history into multimodal decision making. HAMT efficiently encodes all the past panoramic observations via a hierarchical vision transformer (ViT), which first encodes individual images with ViT, then models spatial relation between images in a panoramic observation and finally takes into account temporal relation between panoramas in the history. It, then, jointly combines text, history and current observation to predict the next action. We first train HAMT end-to-end using several proxy tasks including single step action prediction and spatial relation prediction, and then use reinforcement learning to further improve the navigation policy. HAMT achieves new state of the art on a broad range of VLN tasks, including VLN with fine-grained instructions (R2R, RxR), high-level instructions (R2R-Last, REVERIE), dialogs (CVDN) as well as long-horizon VLN (R4R, R2R-Back). We demonstrate HAMT to be particularly effective for navigation tasks with longer trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in NeurIPS 2021; project page at https://cshizhe.github.io/projects/vln_hamt.html; corrected a typo</p></details> |
| **[$A^2$Nav: Action-Aware Zero-Shot Robot Navigation by Exploiting Vision-and-Language Ability of Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07997v1)** | 2023-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the task of zero-shot vision-and-language navigation (ZS-VLN), a practical yet challenging problem in which an agent learns to navigate following a path described by language instructions without requiring any path-instruction annotation data. Normally, the instructions have complex grammatical structures and often contain various action descriptions (e.g., "proceed beyond", "depart from"). How to correctly understand and execute these action demands is a critical problem, and the absence of annotated data makes it even more challenging. Note that a well-educated human being can easily understand path instructions without the need for any special training. In this paper, we propose an action-aware zero-shot VLN method ($A^2$Nav) by exploiting the vision-and-language ability of foundation models. Specifically, the proposed method consists of an instruction parser and an action-aware navigation policy. The instruction parser utilizes the advanced reasoning ability of large language models (e.g., GPT-3) to decompose complex navigation instructions into a sequence of action-specific object navigation sub-tasks. Each sub-task requires the agent to localize the object and navigate to a specific goal position according to the associated action demand. To accomplish these sub-tasks, an action-aware navigation policy is learned from freely collected action-specific datasets that reveal distinct characteristics of each action demand. We use the learned navigation policy for executing sub-tasks sequentially to follow the navigation instruction. Extensive experiments show $A^2$Nav achieves promising ZS-VLN performance and even surpasses the supervised learning methods on R2R-Habitat and RxR-Habitat datasets.</p></details> |  |

This foundational review presents a comprehensive synthesis of recent advancements in Vision-Language-Action models, systematically organized across five thematic pillars that structure the landscape of this rapidly evolving field. We begin by establishing the conceptual foundations of VLA systems, tracing their evolution from cross-modal learning architectures to generalist agents that tightly integrate vision-language models (VLMs), action planners, and hierarchical controllers. Our methodology adopts a rigorous literature review framework, covering over 80 VLA models published in the past three years. Key progress areas include architectural innovations, parameter-efficient training strategies, and real-time inference accelerations. We explore diverse application domains such as humanoid robotics, autonomous vehicles, medical and industrial robotics, precision agriculture, and augmented reality navigation. The review further addresses major challenges across real-time control, multimodal action representation, system scalability, generalization to unseen tasks, and ethical deployment risks. Drawing from the state-of-the-art, we propose targeted solutions including agentic AI adaptation, cross-embodiment generalization, and unified neuro-symbolic planning. In our forward-looking discussion, we outline a future roadmap where VLA models, VLMs, and agentic AI converge to power socially aligned, adaptive, and general-purpose embodied agents. This work serves as a foundational reference for advancing intelligent, real-world robotics and artificial general intelligence. >Vision-language-action, Agentic AI, AI Agents, Vision-language Models</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 18 Figures, 4 Tables</p></details> |

To address this problem, this paper will summarize and compare the structural designs of existing dual-system architectures, and conduct systematic empirical evaluations on the core design elements of existing dual-system architectures. Ultimately, it will provide a low-cost open-source model for further exploration. Of course, this project will continue to update with more experimental conclusions and open-source models with improved performance for everyone to choose from.

| **[Task Reconstruction and Extrapolation for $π_0$ using Text Latent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03500v1)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language-action models (VLAs) often achieve high performance on demonstrated tasks but struggle significantly when required to extrapolate, combining skills learned from different tasks in novel ways. For instance, VLAs might successfully put the cream cheese in the bowl and put the bowl on top of the cabinet, yet still fail to put the cream cheese on top of the cabinet. In this work, we demonstrate that behaviors from distinct tasks can be effectively recombined by manipulating the VLA's internal representations at inference time. Concretely, we identify the text latent by averaging the text tokens' hidden states across all demonstrated trajectories for a specific base task. For executing an extrapolated task, we can temporally interpolate the text latent of the two base tasks and add it back to the text hidden states, so sub-behaviors from the two tasks will be activated sequentially. We evaluate this approach using the newly created libero-ood benchmark, featuring 20 tasks extrapolated from standard LIBERO suites. The results on libero-ood show that all SOTA VLAs achieve < 15% success rate, while $\pi0$ with text latent interpolation reaches an 83% success rate. Further qualitative analysis reveals a tendency for VLAs to exhibit spatial overfitting, mapping object names to demonstrated locations rather than achieving genuine object and goal understanding. Additionally, we find that decoding the text latent yields human-unreadable prompts that can nevertheless instruct the VLA to achieve a 70% success rate on standard LIBERO suites, enabling private instruction or backdoor attacks.</p></details> |  |

However, existing models rely heavily on real-world data, which is costly and labor-intensive to collect. Synthetic data offers a cost-effective alternative, yet its potential remains largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we explore the feasibility of training Vision-Language-Action models entirely with large-scale synthetic action data. We curate SynGrasp-1B, a billion-frame robotic grasping dataset generated in simulation with photorealistic rendering and extensive domain randomization. Building on this, we present GraspVLA, a VLA model pretrained on large-scale synthetic action data as a foundational model for grasping tasks. GraspVLA integrates autoregressive perception tasks and flow-matching-based action generation into a unified Chain-of-Thought process, enabling joint training on synthetic action data and Internet semantics data. This design helps mitigate sim-to-real gaps and facilitates the transfer of learned actions to a broader range of Internet-covered objects, achieving open-vocabulary generalization in grasping. Extensive evaluations across real-world and simulation benchmarks demonstrate GraspVLA's advanced zero-shot generalizability and few-shot adaptability to specific human preferences. We will release SynGrasp-1B dataset and pre-trained weights to benefit the community.</p></details> |  |

This paper explores the potential of using mobile application Global Positioning System (GPS) references and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automatically generate large volumes of IA commands and responses without having a human generate or retroactively tag the data. In our pilot data collection, by driving to various destinations and collecting voice instructions from GPS applications, we demonstrate a means to collect and categorize the diverse sets of instructions, further accompanied by video data to form complete vision-language-action triads. We provide details on our completely automated data collection prototype system, ADVLAT-Engine. We characterize collected GPS voice instructions into eight different classifications, highlighting the breadth of commands and referentialities available for curation from freely available mobile applications. Through research and exploration into the automation of IA data pairs using GPS references, the potential to increase the speed and volume at which high-quality IA datasets are created, while minimizing cost, can pave the way for robust vision-language-action (VLA) models to serve tasks in vision-language navigation (VLN) and human-interactive autonomous systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[CrayonRobo: Object-Centric Prompt-Driven Vision-Language-Action Model for Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02166v1)** | 2025-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In robotic, task goals can be conveyed through various modalities, such as language, goal images, and goal videos. However, natural language can be ambiguous, while images or videos may offer overly detailed specifications. To tackle these challenges, we introduce CrayonRobo that leverages comprehensive multi-modal prompts that explicitly convey both low-level actions and high-level planning in a simple manner. Specifically, for each key-frame in the task sequence, our method allows for manual or automatic generation of simple and expressive 2D visual prompts overlaid on RGB images. These prompts represent the required task goals, such as the end-effector pose and the desired movement direction after contact. We develop a training strategy that enables the model to interpret these visual-language prompts and predict the corresponding contact poses and movement directions in SE(3) space. Furthermore, by sequentially executing all key-frame steps, the model can complete long-horizon tasks. This approach not only helps the model explicitly understand the task objectives but also enhances its robustness on unseen tasks by providing easily interpretable prompts. We evaluate our method in both simulated and real-world environments, demonstrating its robust manipulation capabilities.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |

However, existing models are restricted to robot observations and text-only instructions, lacking the flexibility of interleaved multimodal instructions enabled by recent advances in foundation models in the digital world. In this paper, we present Interleave-VLA, the first framework capable of comprehending interleaved image-text instructions and directly generating continuous action sequences in the physical world. It offers a flexible, model-agnostic paradigm that extends state-of-the-art VLA models with minimal modifications and strong zero-shot generalization. A key challenge in realizing Interleave-VLA is the absence of large-scale interleaved embodied datasets. To bridge this gap, we develop an automatic pipeline that converts text-only instructions from real-world datasets in Open X-Embodiment into interleaved image-text instructions, resulting in the first large-scale real-world interleaved embodied dataset with 210k episodes. Through comprehensive evaluation on simulation benchmarks and real-robot experiments, we demonstrate that Interleave-VLA offers significant benefits: 1) it improves out-of-domain generalization to unseen objects by 2-3x compared to state-of-the-art baselines, 2) supports flexible task interfaces, and 3) handles diverse user-provided image instructions in a zero-shot manner, such as hand-drawn sketches. We further analyze the factors behind Interleave-VLA's strong zero-shot performance, showing that the interleaved paradigm effectively leverages heterogeneous datasets and diverse instruction images, including those from the Internet, which demonstrates strong potential for scaling up. Our model and dataset will be open-sourced.</p></details> |  |
| **[NORA: A Small Open-Sourced Generalist Vision Language Action Model for Embodied Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19854v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing Visual-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown promising performance in zero-shot scenarios, demonstrating impressive task execution and reasoning capabilities. However, a significant challenge arises from the limitations of visual encoding, which can result in failures during tasks such as object grasping. Moreover, these models typically suffer from high computational overhead due to their large sizes, often exceeding 7B parameters. While these models excel in reasoning and task planning, the substantial computational overhead they incur makes them impractical for real-time robotic environments, where speed and efficiency are paramount. To address the limitations of existing VLA models, we propose NORA, a 3B-parameter model designed to reduce computational overhead while maintaining strong task performance. NORA adopts the Qwen-2.5-VL-3B multimodal model as its backbone, leveraging its superior visual-semantic understanding to enhance visual reasoning and action grounding. Additionally, our \model{} is trained on 970k real-world robot demonstrations and equipped with the FAST+ tokenizer for efficient action sequence generation. Experimental results demonstrate that NORA outperforms existing large-scale VLA models, achieving better task performance with significantly reduced computational overhead, making it a more practical solution for real-time robotic autonomy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fine-Tuning Vision-Language-Action Models: Optimizing Speed and Success](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19645v2)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent vision-language-action models (VLAs) build upon pretrained vision-language models and leverage diverse robot datasets to demonstrate strong task execution, language following ability, and semantic generalization. Despite these successes, VLAs struggle with novel robot setups and require fine-tuning to achieve good performance, yet how to most effectively fine-tune them is unclear given many possible strategies. In this work, we study key VLA adaptation design choices such as different action decoding schemes, action representations, and learning objectives for fine-tuning, using OpenVLA as our representative base model. Our empirical analysis informs an Optimized Fine-Tuning (OFT) recipe that integrates parallel decoding, action chunking, a continuous action representation, and a simple L1 regression-based learning objective to altogether improve inference efficiency, policy performance, and flexibility in the model's input-output specifications. We propose OpenVLA-OFT, an instantiation of this recipe, which sets a new state of the art on the LIBERO simulation benchmark, significantly boosting OpenVLA's average success rate across four task suites from 76.5% to 97.1% while increasing action generation throughput by 26$\times$. In real-world evaluations, our fine-tuning recipe enables OpenVLA to successfully execute dexterous, high-frequency control tasks on a bimanual ALOHA robot and outperform other VLAs ($\pi_0$ and RDT-1B) fine-tuned using their default recipes, as well as strong imitation learning policies trained from scratch (Diffusion Policy and ACT) by up to 15% (absolute) in average success rate.

Our investigation reveals that conventional parameter reduction techniques ultimately impair the performance of the language foundation model during the action instruction tuning phase, making them unsuitable for this purpose. We introduce a novel latency-free quadruped MLLM model, dubbed QUART-Online, designed to enhance inference efficiency without degrading the performance of the language foundation model. By incorporating Action Chunk Discretization (ACD), we compress the original action representation space, mapping continuous action values onto a smaller set of discrete representative vectors while preserving critical information. Subsequently, we fine-tune the MLLM to integrate vision, language, and compressed actions into a unified semantic space. Experimental results demonstrate that QUART-Online operates in tandem with the existing MLLM system, achieving real-time inference in sync with the underlying controller frequency, significantly boosting the success rate across various tasks by 65%.

While vision-language-action (VLA) models have demonstrated impressive results for end-to-end robot control, it remains an open question how far such models can generalize in the wild. We describe $\pi_{0.5}$, a new model based on $\pi_{0}$ that uses co-training on heterogeneous tasks to enable broad generalization. $\pi_{0.5}$\ uses data from multiple robots, high-level semantic prediction, web data, and other sources to enable broadly generalizable real-world robotic manipulation. Our system uses a combination of co-training and hybrid multi-modal examples that combine image observations, language commands, object detections, semantic subtask prediction, and low-level actions. Our experiments show that this kind of knowledge transfer is essential for effective generalization, and we demonstrate for the first time that an end-to-end learning-enabled robotic system can perform long-horizon and dexterous manipulation skills, such as cleaning a kitchen or bedroom, in entirely new homes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Few-Shot Vision-Language Action-Incremental Policy Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15517v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Transformer-based robotic manipulation methods utilize multi-view spatial representations and language instructions to learn robot motion trajectories by leveraging numerous robot demonstrations. However, the collection of robot data is extremely challenging, and existing methods lack the capability for continuous learning on new tasks with only a few demonstrations. In this paper, we formulate these challenges as the Few-Shot Action-Incremental Learning (FSAIL) task, and accordingly design a Task-prOmpt graPh evolutIon poliCy (TOPIC) to address these issues. Specifically, to address the data scarcity issue in robotic imitation learning, TOPIC learns Task-Specific Prompts (TSP) through the deep interaction of multi-modal information within few-shot demonstrations, thereby effectively extracting the task-specific discriminative information. On the other hand, to enhance the capability for continual learning on new tasks and mitigate the issue of catastrophic forgetting, TOPIC adopts a Continuous Evolution Strategy (CES). CES leverages the intrinsic relationships between tasks to construct a task relation graph, which effectively facilitates the adaptation of new tasks by reusing skills learned from previous tasks. TOPIC pioneers few-shot continual learning in the robotic manipulation task, and extensive experimental results demonstrate that TOPIC outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by over 26$\%$ in success rate, significantly enhancing the continual learning capabilities of existing Transformer-based policies.</p></details> |  |

However, this approach not only demands extensive amounts of training data but also struggles to effectively understand GUI screenshots and generalize to unseen interfaces. The issue significantly limits its application in real-world scenarios, especially for high-level tasks. Inspired by Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) in large reasoning models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1), which efficiently enhances the problem-solving capabilities of large language models in real-world settings, we propose \name, the first reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance the GUI capabilities of LVLMs in high-level real-world task scenarios, through unified action space rule modeling. By leveraging a small amount of carefully curated high-quality data across multiple platforms (including Windows, Linux, MacOS, Android, and Web) and employing policy optimization algorithms such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to update the model, \name achieves superior performance using only 0.02\% of the data (3K vs. 13M) compared to previous state-of-the-art methods like OS-Atlas across eight benchmarks spanning three different platforms (mobile, desktop, and web). These results demonstrate the immense potential of reinforcement learning based on unified action space rule modeling in improving the execution capabilities of LVLMs for real-world GUI agent tasks.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, their real-world deployment is hindered by substantial computational and storage demands. Recent insights into the homogeneous patterns in the LLM layer have inspired sparsification techniques to address these challenges, such as early exit and token pruning. However, these methods often neglect the critical role of the final layers that encode the semantic information most relevant to downstream robotic tasks. Aligning with the recent breakthrough of the Shallow Brain Hypothesis (SBH) in neuroscience and the mixture of experts in model sparsification, we conceptualize each LLM layer as an expert and propose a Mixture-of-Layers Vision-Language-Action model (MoLe-VLA, or simply MoLe) architecture for dynamic LLM layer activation. We introduce a Spatial-Temporal Aware Router (STAR) for MoLe to selectively activate only parts of the layers based on the robot's current state, mimicking the brain's distinct signal pathways specialized for cognition and causal reasoning. Additionally, to compensate for the cognitive ability of LLMs lost in MoLe, we devise a Cognition Self-Knowledge Distillation (CogKD) framework. CogKD enhances the understanding of task demands and improves the generation of task-relevant action sequences by leveraging cognitive features. Extensive experiments conducted in both RLBench simulation and real-world environments demonstrate the superiority of MoLe-VLA in both efficiency and performance. Specifically, MoLe-VLA achieves an 8% improvement in the mean success rate across ten tasks while reducing computational costs by up to x5.6 compared to standard LLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, fine-tuning these models through supervised learning struggles to achieve robust performance due to limited, inconsistent demonstrations, especially in contact-rich environments. In this paper, we propose a reinforced fine-tuning approach for VLA models, named ConRFT, which consists of offline and online fine-tuning with a unified consistency-based training objective, to address these challenges. In the offline stage, our method integrates behavior cloning and Q-learning to effectively extract policy from a small set of demonstrations and stabilize value estimating. In the online stage, the VLA model is further fine-tuned via consistency policy, with human interventions to ensure safe exploration and high sample efficiency. We evaluate our approach on eight diverse real-world manipulation tasks. It achieves an average success rate of 96.3% within 45-90 minutes of online fine-tuning, outperforming prior supervised methods with a 144% improvement in success rate and 1.9x shorter episode length. This work highlights the potential of integrating reinforcement learning to enhance the performance of VLA models for real-world robotic applications.

When a robot lacks the necessary tools to accomplish a task requested by a human, it autonomously designs the required instruments and learns how to use them to achieve the goal. Evolution 6.0 is an autonomous robotic system powered by Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Vision-Language Action (VLA) models, and Text-to-3D generative models for tool design and task execution. The system comprises two key modules: the Tool Generation Module, which fabricates task-specific tools from visual and textual data, and the Action Generation Module, which converts natural language instructions into robotic actions. It integrates QwenVLM for environmental understanding, OpenVLA for task execution, and Llama-Mesh for 3D tool generation. Evaluation results demonstrate a 90% success rate for tool generation with a 10-second inference time, and action generation achieving 83.5% in physical and visual generalization, 70% in motion generalization, and 37% in semantic generalization. Future improvements will focus on bimanual manipulation, expanded task capabilities, and enhanced environmental interpretation to improve real-world adaptability.</p></details> | Submitted to IROS |

A capable household robot should recognize ambiguity and ask relevant clarification questions to infer the user intent accurately, leading to more effective task execution. To study this problem, we introduce the Ask-to-Act task, where an embodied agent must fetch a specific object instance given an ambiguous instruction in a home environment. The agent must strategically ask minimal, yet relevant, clarification questions to resolve ambiguity while navigating under partial observability. To solve this problem, we propose a novel approach that fine-tunes multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as vision-language-action (VLA) policies using online reinforcement learning (RL) with LLM-generated rewards. Our method eliminates the need for large-scale human demonstrations or manually engineered rewards for training such agents. We benchmark against strong zero-shot baselines, including GPT-4o, and supervised fine-tuned MLLMs, on our task. Our results demonstrate that our RL-finetuned MLLM outperforms all baselines by a significant margin ($19.1$-$40.3\%$), generalizing well to novel scenes and tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of adapting MLLMs as VLA agents that can act and ask for help using LLM-generated rewards with online RL.</p></details> |  |

OpenDriveVLA builds upon open-source pre-trained large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to generate reliable driving actions, conditioned on 3D environmental perception, ego vehicle states, and driver commands. To bridge the modality gap between driving visual representations and language embeddings, we propose a hierarchical vision-language alignment process, projecting both 2D and 3D structured visual tokens into a unified semantic space. Besides, OpenDriveVLA models the dynamic relationships between the ego vehicle, surrounding agents, and static road elements through an autoregressive agent-env-ego interaction process, ensuring both spatially and behaviorally informed trajectory planning. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that OpenDriveVLA achieves state-of-the-art results across open-loop trajectory planning and driving-related question-answering tasks. Qualitative analyses further illustrate OpenDriveVLA's superior capability to follow high-level driving commands and robustly generate trajectories under challenging scenarios, highlighting its potential for next-generation end-to-end autonomous driving. We will release our code to facilitate further research in this domain.</p></details> |  |

While this paradigm effectively utilizes large-scale data from both robotic and non-robotic sources, current VLAs primarily focus on direct input--output mappings, lacking the intermediate reasoning steps crucial for complex manipulation tasks. As a result, existing VLAs lack temporal planning or reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we introduce a method that incorporates explicit visual chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning into vision-language-action models (VLAs) by predicting future image frames autoregressively as visual goals before generating a short action sequence to achieve these goals. We introduce CoT-VLA, a state-of-the-art 7B VLA that can understand and generate visual and action tokens. Our experimental results demonstrate that CoT-VLA achieves strong performance, outperforming the state-of-the-art VLA model by 17% in real-world manipulation tasks and 6% in simulation benchmarks.

Recent advancements in humanoid robots have shown great promise as a hardware platform for building generalist autonomy in the human world. A robot foundation model, trained on massive and diverse data sources, is essential for enabling the robots to reason about novel situations, robustly handle real-world variability, and rapidly learn new tasks. To this end, we introduce GR00T N1, an open foundation model for humanoid robots. GR00T N1 is a Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model with a dual-system architecture. The vision-language module (System 2) interprets the environment through vision and language instructions. The subsequent diffusion transformer module (System 1) generates fluid motor actions in real time. Both modules are tightly coupled and jointly trained end-to-end. We train GR00T N1 with a heterogeneous mixture of real-robot trajectories, human videos, and synthetically generated datasets. We show that our generalist robot model GR00T N1 outperforms the state-of-the-art imitation learning baselines on standard simulation benchmarks across multiple robot embodiments. Furthermore, we deploy our model on the Fourier GR-1 humanoid robot for language-conditioned bimanual manipulation tasks, achieving strong performance with high data efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Autho...</summary><p>Authors are listed alphabetically.

Existing approaches require fine-tuning pre-trained visionlanguage models (VLMs) as visual and language features are independently fed into downstream policies, degrading the pre-trained semantic alignments. We propose OTTER, a novel VLA architecture that leverages these existing alignments through explicit, text-aware visual feature extraction. Instead of processing all visual features, OTTER selectively extracts and passes only task-relevant visual features that are semantically aligned with the language instruction to the policy transformer. This allows OTTER to keep the pre-trained vision-language encoders frozen. Thereby, OTTER preserves and utilizes the rich semantic understanding learned from large-scale pre-training, enabling strong zero-shot generalization capabilities. In simulation and real-world experiments, OTTER significantly outperforms existing VLA models, demonstrating strong zeroshot generalization to novel objects and environments.

This report introduces a new family of AI models purposefully designed for robotics and built upon the foundation of Gemini 2.0. We present Gemini Robotics, an advanced Vision-Language-Action (VLA) generalist model capable of directly controlling robots. Gemini Robotics executes smooth and reactive movements to tackle a wide range of complex manipulation tasks while also being robust to variations in object types and positions, handling unseen environments as well as following diverse, open vocabulary instructions. We show that with additional fine-tuning, Gemini Robotics can be specialized to new capabilities including solving long-horizon, highly dexterous tasks, learning new short-horizon tasks from as few as 100 demonstrations and adapting to completely novel robot embodiments. This is made possible because Gemini Robotics builds on top of the Gemini Robotics-ER model, the second model we introduce in this work. Gemini Robotics-ER (Embodied Reasoning) extends Gemini's multimodal reasoning capabilities into the physical world, with enhanced spatial and temporal understanding. This enables capabilities relevant to robotics including object detection, pointing, trajectory and grasp prediction, as well as multi-view correspondence and 3D bounding box predictions. We show how this novel combination can support a variety of robotics applications. We also discuss and address important safety considerations related to this new class of robotics foundation models. The Gemini Robotics family marks a substantial step towards developing general-purpose robots that realizes AI's potential in the physical world.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dita: Scaling Diffusion Transformer for Generalist Vision-Language-Action Policy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19757v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While recent vision-language-action models trained on diverse robot datasets exhibit promising generalization capabilities with limited in-domain data, their reliance on compact action heads to predict discretized or continuous actions constrains adaptability to heterogeneous action spaces. We present Dita, a scalable framework that leverages Transformer architectures to directly denoise continuous action sequences through a unified multimodal diffusion process. Departing from prior methods that condition denoising on fused embeddings via shallow networks, Dita employs in-context conditioning -- enabling fine-grained alignment between denoised actions and raw visual tokens from historical observations. This design explicitly models action deltas and environmental nuances. By scaling the diffusion action denoiser alongside the Transformer's scalability, Dita effectively integrates cross-embodiment datasets across diverse camera perspectives, observation scenes, tasks, and action spaces. Such synergy enhances robustness against various variances and facilitates the successful execution of long-horizon tasks. Evaluations across extensive benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art or comparative performance in simulation. Notably, Dita achieves robust real-world adaptation to environmental variances and complex long-horizon tasks through 10-shot finetuning, using only third-person camera inputs. The architecture establishes a versatile, lightweight and open-source baseline for generalist robot policy learning.

| **[DataPlatter: Boosting Robotic Manipulation Generalization with Minimal Costly Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19516v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing adoption of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in embodied AI intensifies the demand for diverse manipulation demonstrations. However, high costs associated with data collection often result in insufficient data coverage across all scenarios, which limits the performance of the models. It is observed that the spatial reasoning phase (SRP) in large workspace dominates the failure cases. Fortunately, this data can be collected with low cost, underscoring the potential of leveraging inexpensive data to improve model performance. In this paper, we introduce the DataPlatter method, a framework that decouples training trajectories into distinct task stages and leverages abundant easily collectible SRP data to enhance VLA model's generalization. Through analysis we demonstrate that sub-task-specific training with additional SRP data with proper proportion can act as a performance catalyst for robot manipulation, maximizing the utilization of costly physical interaction phase (PIP) data. Experiments show that through introducing large proportion of cost-effective SRP trajectories into a limited set of PIP data, we can achieve a maximum improvement of 41\% on success rate in zero-shot scenes, while with the ability to transfer manipulation skill to novel targets.</p></details> |  |

This results in limited generalization to new tasks and difficulties in pinpointing errors within long-horizon, multi-stage tasks. To address this, we propose RoboMatrix, a skill-centric hierarchical framework designed for scalable robot task planning and execution in open-world environments. RoboMatrix extracts general meta-skills from diverse complex tasks, enabling the completion of unseen tasks through skill composition. Its architecture consists of a high-level scheduling layer that utilizes large language models (LLMs) for task decomposition, an intermediate skill layer housing meta-skill models, and a low-level hardware layer for robot control. A key innovation of our work is the introduction of the first unified vision-language-action (VLA) model capable of seamlessly integrating both movement and manipulation within one model. This is achieved by combining vision and language prompts to generate discrete actions. Experimental results demonstrate that RoboMatrix achieves a 50% higher success rate than task-centric baselines when applied to unseen objects, scenes, and tasks. To advance open-world robotics research, we will open-source code, hardware designs, model weights, and datasets at https://github.com/WayneMao/RoboMatrix.</p></details> | 17 pages, 16 figures |
| **[Diffusion Transformer Policy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15959v6)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent large vision-language-action models pretrained on diverse robot datasets have demonstrated the potential for generalizing to new environments with a few in-domain data. However, those approaches usually predict individual discretized or continuous action by a small action head, which limits the ability in handling diverse action spaces. In contrast, we model the continuous action sequence with a large multi-modal diffusion transformer, dubbed as Diffusion Transformer Policy, in which we directly denoise action chunks by a large transformer model rather than a small action head for action embedding. By leveraging the scaling capability of transformers, the proposed approach can effectively model continuous end-effector actions across large diverse robot datasets, and achieve better generalization performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of Diffusion Transformer Policy on Maniskill2, Libero, Calvin and SimplerEnv, as well as the real-world Franka arm, achieving consistent better performance on Real-to-Sim benchmark SimplerEnv, real-world Franka Arm and Libero compared to OpenVLA and Octo. Specifically, without bells and whistles, the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance with only a single third-view camera stream in the Calvin task ABC->D, improving the average number of tasks completed in a row of 5 to 3.6, and the pretraining stage significantly facilitates the success sequence length on the Calvin by over 1.2.</p></details> | <details><summary>prepr...</summary><p>preprint; New Project Page: https://robodita.github.io; revert unsuitable replacement</p></details> |

While VLAs have shown promising progress, they may suffer from failures when faced with novel and complex tasks. To emulate human-like reasoning for more robust manipulation, we propose the self-corrected (SC-)VLA framework, which integrates fast system for directly predicting actions and slow system for reflecting on failed actions within a single VLA policy. For the fast system, we incorporate parameter-efficient fine-tuning to equip the model with pose prediction capabilities while preserving the inherent reasoning abilities of MLLMs. For the slow system, we propose a Chain-of-Thought training strategy for failure correction, designed to mimic human reflection after a manipulation failure. Specifically, our model learns to identify the causes of action failures, adaptively seek expert feedback, reflect on the current failure scenario, and iteratively generate corrective actions, step by step. Furthermore, a continuous policy learning method is designed based on successfully corrected samples, enhancing the fast system's adaptability to the current configuration. We compare SC-VLA with the previous SOTA VLA in both simulation and real-world tasks, demonstrating an efficient correction process and improved manipulation accuracy on both seen and unseen tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, conventional mobile manipulation approaches often struggle to generalize across different tasks and environments because of the lack of large-scale training. In contrast, recent advances in vision-language-action (VLA) models have shown impressive generalization capabilities, but these foundation models are developed for fixed-base manipulation tasks. Therefore, we propose an efficient policy adaptation framework named MoManipVLA to transfer pre-trained VLA models of fix-base manipulation to mobile manipulation, so that high generalization ability across tasks and environments can be achieved in mobile manipulation policy. Specifically, we utilize pre-trained VLA models to generate waypoints of the end-effector with high generalization ability. We design motion planning objectives for the mobile base and the robot arm, which aim at maximizing the physical feasibility of the trajectory. Finally, we present an efficient bi-level objective optimization framework for trajectory generation, where the upper-level optimization predicts waypoints for base movement to enhance the manipulator policy space, and the lower-level optimization selects the optimal end-effector trajectory to complete the manipulation task. In this way, MoManipVLA can adjust the position of the robot base in a zero-shot manner, thus making the waypoints predicted from the fixed-base VLA models feasible. Extensive experimental results on OVMM and the real world demonstrate that MoManipVLA achieves a 4.2% higher success rate than the state-of-the-art mobile manipulation, and only requires 50 training cost for real world deployment due to the strong generalization ability in the pre-trained VLA models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025.

| **[HybridVLA: Collaborative Diffusion and Autoregression in a Unified Vision-Language-Action Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10631v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) for common-sense reasoning have led to the development of vision-language-action (VLA) models, enabling robots to perform generalized manipulation. Although existing autoregressive VLA methods leverage large-scale pretrained knowledge, they disrupt the continuity of actions. Meanwhile, some VLA methods incorporate an additional diffusion head to predict continuous actions, relying solely on VLM-extracted features, which limits their reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we introduce HybridVLA, a unified framework that seamlessly integrates the strengths of both autoregressive and diffusion policies within a single large language model, rather than simply connecting them. To bridge the generation gap, a collaborative training recipe is proposed that injects the diffusion modeling directly into the next-token prediction. With this recipe, we find that these two forms of action prediction not only reinforce each other but also exhibit varying performance across different tasks. Therefore, we design a collaborative action ensemble mechanism that adaptively fuses these two predictions, leading to more robust control. In experiments, HybridVLA outperforms previous state-of-the-art VLA methods across various simulation and real-world tasks, including both single-arm and dual-arm robots, while demonstrating stable manipulation in previously unseen configurations.</p></details> |  |

However, the high cost of real-world data collection hinders further data scaling, thereby restricting the generalizability of VLAs. In this paper, we introduce ReBot, a novel real-to-sim-to-real approach for scaling real robot datasets and adapting VLA models to target domains, which is the last-mile deployment challenge in robot manipulation. Specifically, ReBot replays real-world robot trajectories in simulation to diversify manipulated objects (real-to-sim), and integrates the simulated movements with inpainted real-world background to synthesize physically realistic and temporally consistent robot videos (sim-to-real). Our approach has several advantages: 1) it enjoys the benefit of real data to minimize the sim-to-real gap; 2) it leverages the scalability of simulation; and 3) it can generalize a pretrained VLA to a target domain with fully automated data pipelines. Extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world environments show that ReBot significantly enhances the performance and robustness of VLAs. For example, in SimplerEnv with the WidowX robot, ReBot improved the in-domain performance of Octo by 7.2% and OpenVLA by 21.8%, and out-of-domain generalization by 19.9% and 9.4%, respectively. For real-world evaluation with a Franka robot, ReBot increased the success rates of Octo by 17% and OpenVLA by 20%.

A large step for the community are open Vision Language Action models which showcase strong performance in a wide variety of tasks. In this work, we study the visual generalization capabilities of three existing robotic foundation models, and propose a corresponding evaluation framework. Our study shows that the existing models do not exhibit robustness to visual out-of-domain scenarios. This is potentially caused by limited variations in the training data and/or catastrophic forgetting, leading to domain limitations in the vision foundation models. We further explore OpenVLA, which uses two pre-trained vision foundation models and is, therefore, expected to generalize to out-of-domain experiments. However, we showcase catastrophic forgetting by DINO-v2 in OpenVLA through its failure to fulfill the task of depth regression. To overcome the aforementioned issue of visual catastrophic forgetting, we propose a gradual backbone reversal approach founded on model merging. This enables OpenVLA which requires the adaptation of the visual backbones during initial training -- to regain its visual generalization ability. Regaining this capability enables our ReVLA model to improve over OpenVLA by a factor of 77% and 66% for grasping and lifting in visual OOD tasks .</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICRA-2025, Atlanta</p></details> |

To advance the field, we introduce CombatVLA, an efficient VLA model optimized for combat tasks in 3D action role-playing games(ARPGs). Specifically, our CombatVLA is a 3B model trained on video-action pairs collected by an action tracker, where the data is formatted as action-of-thought (AoT) sequences. Thereafter, CombatVLA seamlessly integrates into an action execution framework, allowing efficient inference through our truncated AoT strategy. Experimental results demonstrate that CombatVLA not only outperforms all existing models on the combat understanding benchmark but also achieves a 50-fold acceleration in game combat. Moreover, it has a higher task success rate than human players. We will open-source all resources, including the action tracker, dataset, benchmark, model weights, training code, and the implementation of the framework at https://combatvla.github.io/.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces a novel vision-language-action (VLA) model, mixture of robotic experts (MoRE), for quadruped robots that aim to introduce reinforcement learning (RL) for fine-tuning large-scale VLA models with a large amount of mixed-quality data. MoRE integrates multiple low-rank adaptation modules as distinct experts within a dense multi-modal large language model (MLLM), forming a sparse-activated mixture-of-experts model. This design enables the model to effectively adapt to a wide array of downstream tasks. Moreover, we employ a reinforcement learning-based training objective to train our model as a Q-function after deeply exploring the structural properties of our tasks. Effective learning from automatically collected mixed-quality data enhances data efficiency and model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoRE outperforms all baselines across six different skills and exhibits superior generalization capabilities in out-of-distribution scenarios. We further validate our method in real-world scenarios, confirming the practicality of our approach and laying a solid foundation for future research on multi-task learning in quadruped robots.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICRA 2025</p></details> |

Retraining these models with 3D data is computationally prohibitive, while discarding existing 2D datasets wastes valuable resources. To bridge this gap, we propose PointVLA, a framework that enhances pre-trained VLAs with point cloud inputs without requiring retraining. Our method freezes the vanilla action expert and injects 3D features via a lightweight modular block. To identify the most effective way of integrating point cloud representations, we conduct a skip-block analysis to pinpoint less useful blocks in the vanilla action expert, ensuring that 3D features are injected only into these blocks--minimizing disruption to pre-trained representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PointVLA outperforms state-of-the-art 2D imitation learning methods, such as OpenVLA, Diffusion Policy and DexVLA, across both simulated and real-world robotic tasks. Specifically, we highlight several key advantages of PointVLA enabled by point cloud integration: (1) Few-shot multi-tasking, where PointVLA successfully performs four different tasks using only 20 demonstrations each; (2) Real-vs-photo discrimination, where PointVLA distinguishes real objects from their images, leveraging 3D world knowledge to improve safety and reliability; (3) Height adaptability, Unlike conventional 2D imitation learning methods, PointVLA enables robots to adapt to objects at varying table height that unseen in train data. Furthermore, PointVLA achieves strong performance in long-horizon tasks, such as picking and packing objects from a moving conveyor belt, showcasing its ability to generalize across complex, dynamic environments.</p></details> |  |

While VLA models offer significant capabilities, they also introduce new attack surfaces, making them vulnerable to adversarial attacks. With these vulnerabilities largely unexplored, this paper systematically quantifies the robustness of VLA-based robotic systems. Recognizing the unique demands of robotic execution, our attack objectives target the inherent spatial and functional characteristics of robotic systems. In particular, we introduce two untargeted attack objectives that leverage spatial foundations to destabilize robotic actions, and a targeted attack objective that manipulates the robotic trajectory. Additionally, we design an adversarial patch generation approach that places a small, colorful patch within the camera's view, effectively executing the attack in both digital and physical environments. Our evaluation reveals a marked degradation in task success rates, with up to a 100\% reduction across a suite of simulated robotic tasks, highlighting critical security gaps in current VLA architectures. By unveiling these vulnerabilities and proposing actionable evaluation metrics, we advance both the understanding and enhancement of safety for VLA-based robotic systems, underscoring the necessity for continuously developing robust defense strategies prior to physical-world deployments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Githu...</summary><p>Github: https://github.com/William-wAng618/roboticAttack Homepage: https://vlaattacker.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Robotic Control via Embodied Chain-of-Thought Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08693v3)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A key limitation of learned robot control policies is their inability to generalize outside their training data. Recent works on vision-language-action models (VLAs) have shown that the use of large, internet pre-trained vision-language models as the backbone of learned robot policies can substantially improve their robustness and generalization ability. Yet, one of the most exciting capabilities of large vision-language models in other domains is their ability to reason iteratively through complex problems. Can that same capability be brought into robotics to allow policies to improve performance by reasoning about a given task before acting? Naive use of "chain-of-thought" (CoT) style prompting is significantly less effective with standard VLAs because of the relatively simple training examples that are available to them. Additionally, purely semantic reasoning about sub-tasks, as is common in regular CoT, is insufficient for robot policies that need to ground their reasoning in sensory observations and the robot state. To this end, we introduce Embodied Chain-of-Thought Reasoning (ECoT) for VLAs, in which we train VLAs to perform multiple steps of reasoning about plans, sub-tasks, motions, and visually grounded features like object bounding boxes and end effector positions, before predicting the robot action. We design a scalable pipeline for generating synthetic training data for ECoT on large robot datasets. We demonstrate, that ECoT increases the absolute success rate of OpenVLA, the current strongest open-source VLA policy, by 28% across challenging generalization tasks, without any additional robot training data. Additionally, ECoT makes it easier for humans to interpret a policy's failures and correct its behavior using natural language.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Website: https://embodied-cot.github.io.

| **[Refined Policy Distillation: From VLA Generalists to RL Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05833v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent generalist Vision-Language-Action Models (VLAs) can perform a variety of tasks on real robots with remarkable generalization capabilities. However, reported success rates are often not on par with those of expert policies. Moreover, VLAs usually do not work out of the box and often must be fine-tuned as they are sensitive to setup changes. In this work, we present Refined Policy Distillation (RPD), an RL-based policy refinement method that enables the distillation of large generalist models into small, high-performing expert policies. The student policy is guided during the RL exploration by actions of a teacher VLA for increased sample efficiency and faster convergence. Different from previous work that focuses on applying VLAs to real-world experiments, we create fine-tuned versions of Octo and OpenVLA for ManiSkill2 to evaluate RPD in simulation. As our results for different manipulation tasks demonstrate, RPD enables the RL agent to learn expert policies that surpass the teacher's performance in both dense and sparse reward settings. Our approach is even robust to changes in the camera perspective and can generalize to task variations that the underlying VLA cannot solve.</p></details> |  |
| **[VLA Model-Expert Collaboration for Bi-directional Manipulation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04163v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of vision-language-action (VLA) models has given rise to foundation models for robot manipulation. Although these models have achieved significant improvements, their generalization in multi-task manipulation remains limited. This study proposes a VLA model-expert collaboration framework that leverages a limited number of expert actions to enhance VLA model performance. This approach reduces expert workload relative to manual operation while simultaneously improving the reliability and generalization of VLA models. Furthermore, manipulation data collected during collaboration can further refine the VLA model, while human participants concurrently enhance their skills. This bi-directional learning loop boosts the overall performance of the collaboration system. Experimental results across various VLA models demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system in collaborative manipulation and learning, as evidenced by improved success rates across tasks. Additionally, validation using a brain-computer interface (BCI) indicates that the collaboration system enhances the efficiency of low-speed action systems by involving VLA model during manipulation. These promising results pave the way for advancing human-robot interaction in the era of foundation models for robotics. (Project website: https://aoqunjin.github.io/Expert-VLA/)</p></details> |  |
| **[DexGraspVLA: A Vision-Language-Action Framework Towards General Dexterous Grasping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20900v2)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dexterous grasping remains a fundamental yet challenging problem in robotics. A general-purpose robot must be capable of grasping diverse objects in arbitrary scenarios. However, existing research typically relies on specific assumptions, such as single-object settings or limited environments, leading to constrained generalization. Our solution is DexGraspVLA, a hierarchical framework that utilizes a pre-trained Vision-Language model as the high-level task planner and learns a diffusion-based policy as the low-level Action controller. The key insight lies in iteratively transforming diverse language and visual inputs into domain-invariant representations, where imitation learning can be effectively applied due to the alleviation of domain shift. Thus, it enables robust generalization across a wide range of real-world scenarios. Notably, our method achieves a 90+% success rate under thousands of unseen object, lighting, and background combinations in a ``zero-shot'' environment. Empirical analysis further confirms the consistency of internal model behavior across environmental variations, thereby validating our design and explaining its generalization performance. We hope our work can be a step forward in achieving general dexterous grasping. Our demo and code can be found at https://dexgraspvla.github.io/.</p></details> | 21 pages, 10 figures |

A key bottleneck is that collecting robotic data often requires expertise or specialized hardware, limiting accessibility and scalability. We posit that natural language offers an intuitive and accessible interface for robot learning. To this end, we study two aspects: (1) enabling non-experts to collect robotic data through natural language supervision (e.g., "move the arm to the right") and (2) learning robotic policies directly from this supervision. Specifically, we introduce a data collection framework that collects robot demonstrations based on natural language supervision and further augments these demonstrations. We then present CLIP-RT, a vision-language-action (VLA) model that learns language-conditioned visuomotor policies from this supervision. CLIP-RT adapts the pretrained CLIP models and learns to predict language-based motion primitives via contrastive imitation learning. We train CLIP-RT on the Open X-Embodiment dataset and finetune it on in-domain data collected by our framework to learn diverse skills. CLIP-RT demonstrates strong capabilities in learning novel manipulation skills, outperforming the state-of-the-art model, OpenVLA (7B parameters), by 24% in average success rates, while using 7x fewer parameters (1B). We further observe that CLIP-RT shows significant improvements in few-shot generalization. Finally, through collaboration with humans or large pretrained models, we demonstrate that CLIP-RT can further improve its generalization on challenging robotic tasks.</p></details> | 27 pages |

However, these models pose urgent safety challenges during deployment, including the risk of physical harm to the environment, the robot itself, and humans. How can safety be explicitly incorporated into VLAs? In this work, we propose SafeVLA, a novel algorithm designed to integrate safety into VLAs, ensuring the protection of the environment, robot hardware and humans in real-world settings. SafeVLA effectively balances safety and task performance by employing large-scale constrained learning within simulated environments. We demonstrate that SafeVLA outperforms the current state-of-the-art method in both safety and task performance, achieving average improvements of 83.58% and 3.85%, respectively, in simulation. By prioritizing safety, our approach eliminates high-risk behaviors and reduces the upper bound of unsafe behaviors to 1/35 of that in the current state-of-the-art, thereby significantly mitigating long-tail risks. Furthermore, the learned safety constraints generalize to diverse, unseen scenarios, including multiple out-of-distribution perturbations and tasks.

Building on the success of large language models and vision-language models, a new category of multimodal models -- referred to as vision-language-action models (VLAs) -- has emerged to address language-conditioned robotic tasks in embodied AI by leveraging their distinct ability to generate actions. In recent years, a myriad of VLAs have been developed, making it imperative to capture the rapidly evolving landscape through a comprehensive survey. To this end, we present the first survey on VLAs for embodied AI. This work provides a detailed taxonomy of VLAs, organized into three major lines of research. The first line focuses on individual components of VLAs. The second line is dedicated to developing control policies adept at predicting low-level actions. The third line comprises high-level task planners capable of decomposing long-horizon tasks into a sequence of subtasks, thereby guiding VLAs to follow more general user instructions. Furthermore, we provide an extensive summary of relevant resources, including datasets, simulators, and benchmarks. Finally, we discuss the challenges faced by VLAs and outline promising future directions in embodied AI.

| **[Accelerating Vision-Language-Action Model Integrated with Action Chunking via Parallel Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02310v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models demonstrate remarkable potential for generalizable robotic manipulation. The performance of VLA models can be improved by integrating with action chunking, a critical technique for effective control. However, action chunking linearly scales up action dimensions in VLA models with increased chunking sizes. This reduces the inference efficiency. To tackle this problem, we propose PD-VLA, the first parallel decoding framework for VLA models integrated with action chunking. Our framework reformulates autoregressive decoding as a nonlinear system solved by parallel fixed-point iterations. This approach preserves model performance with mathematical guarantees while significantly improving decoding speed. In addition, it enables training-free acceleration without architectural changes, as well as seamless synergy with existing acceleration techniques. Extensive simulations validate that our PD-VLA maintains competitive success rates while achieving 2.52 times execution frequency on manipulators (with 7 degrees of freedom) compared with the fundamental VLA model. Furthermore, we experimentally identify the most effective settings for acceleration. Finally, real-world experiments validate its high applicability across different tasks.</p></details> |  |

Trained on a dataset comprising over 8,000 simulated flight trajectories across three key categories-Human Recognition, Symbol Understanding, and Reasoning-the model generates real-time 4D action commands based on first-person visual inputs and textual instructions. To further enhance performance in intricate scenarios, we propose CognitiveDrone-R1, which integrates an additional Vision-Language Model (VLM) reasoning module to simplify task directives prior to high-frequency control. Experimental evaluations using our open-source benchmark, CognitiveDroneBench, reveal that while a racing-oriented model (RaceVLA) achieves an overall success rate of 31.3%, the base CognitiveDrone model reaches 59.6%, and CognitiveDrone-R1 attains a success rate of 77.2%. These results demonstrate improvements of up to 30% in critical cognitive tasks, underscoring the effectiveness of incorporating advanced reasoning capabilities into UAV control systems.

| **[A Taxonomy for Evaluating Generalist Robot Policies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01238v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning for robotics promises to unlock generalization to novel tasks and environments. Guided by this promise, many recent works have focused on scaling up robot data collection and developing larger, more expressive policies to achieve this. But how do we measure progress towards this goal of policy generalization in practice? Evaluating and quantifying generalization is the Wild West of modern robotics, with each work proposing and measuring different types of generalization in their own, often difficult to reproduce, settings. In this work, our goal is (1) to outline the forms of generalization we believe are important in robot manipulation in a comprehensive and fine-grained manner, and (2) to provide reproducible guidelines for measuring these notions of generalization. We first propose STAR-Gen, a taxonomy of generalization for robot manipulation structured around visual, semantic, and behavioral generalization. We discuss how our taxonomy encompasses most prior notions of generalization in robotics. Next, we instantiate STAR-Gen with a concrete real-world benchmark based on the widely-used Bridge V2 dataset. We evaluate a variety of state-of-the-art models on this benchmark to demonstrate the utility of our taxonomy in practice. Our taxonomy of generalization can yield many interesting insights into existing models: for example, we observe that current vision-language-action models struggle with various types of semantic generalization, despite the promise of pre-training on internet-scale language datasets. We believe STAR-Gen and our guidelines can improve the dissemination and evaluation of progress towards generalization in robotics, which we hope will guide model design and future data collection efforts.

However, it typically relies on large amounts of human demonstration data, which limits its scalability and applicability in dynamic, real-world environments. One key challenge in this context is object generalization, where a robot trained to perform a task with one object, such as "hand over the apple," struggles to transfer its skills to a semantically similar but visually different object, such as "hand over the peach." This gap in generalization to new objects beyond those in the same category has yet to be adequately addressed in previous work on end-to-end visuomotor policy learning. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective approach for achieving object generalization through Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, referred to as \textbf{ObjectVLA}. Our model enables robots to generalize learned skills to novel objects without requiring explicit human demonstrations for each new target object. By leveraging vision-language pair data, our method provides a lightweight and scalable way to inject knowledge about the target object, establishing an implicit link between the object and the desired action. We evaluate ObjectVLA on a real robotic platform, demonstrating its ability to generalize across 100 novel objects with a 64\% success rate in selecting objects not seen during training. Furthermore, we propose a more accessible method for enhancing object generalization in VLA models, using a smartphone to capture a few images and fine-tune the pre-trained model. These results highlight the effectiveness of our approach in enabling object-level generalization and reducing the need for extensive human demonstrations, paving the way for more flexible and scalable robotic learning systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page at https://objectvla.github.io/</p></details> |

Intricate instructions (e.g., "Could you make me a vegetarian sandwich?" or "I don't like that one") require not just the ability to physically perform the individual steps, but the ability to situate complex commands and feedback in the physical world. In this work, we describe a system that uses vision-language models in a hierarchical structure, first reasoning over complex prompts and user feedback to deduce the most appropriate next step to fulfill the task, and then performing that step with low-level actions. In contrast to direct instruction following methods that can fulfill simple commands ("pick up the cup"), our system can reason through complex prompts and incorporate situated feedback during task execution ("that's not trash"). We evaluate our system across three robotic platforms, including single-arm, dual-arm, and dual-arm mobile robots, demonstrating its ability to handle tasks such as cleaning messy tables, making sandwiches, and grocery shopping.</p></details> |  |

Why can't large language models replicate this holistic understanding? Through a systematic analysis of existing training paradigms in vision-language-action models (VLA), we identify two key challenges: spurious forgetting, where robot training overwrites crucial visual-text alignments, and task interference, where competing control and understanding tasks degrade performance when trained jointly. To overcome these limitations, we propose ChatVLA, a novel framework featuring Phased Alignment Training, which incrementally integrates multimodal data after initial control mastery, and a Mixture-of-Experts architecture to minimize task interference. ChatVLA demonstrates competitive performance on visual question-answering datasets and significantly surpasses state-of-the-art vision-language-action (VLA) methods on multimodal understanding benchmarks. Notably, it achieves a six times higher performance on MMMU and scores 47.2% on MMStar with a more parameter-efficient design than ECoT. Furthermore, ChatVLA demonstrates superior performance on 25 real-world robot manipulation tasks compared to existing VLA methods like OpenVLA. Our findings highlight the potential of our unified framework for achieving both robust multimodal understanding and effective robot control.</p></details> |  |
| **[VLAS: Vision-Language-Action Model With Speech Instructions For Customized Robot Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13508v2)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language-action models (VLAs) have become increasingly popular in robot manipulation for their end-to-end design and remarkable performance. However, existing VLAs rely heavily on vision-language models (VLMs) that only support text-based instructions, neglecting the more natural speech modality for human-robot interaction. Traditional speech integration methods usually involves a separate speech recognition system, which complicates the model and introduces error propagation. Moreover, the transcription procedure would lose non-semantic information in the raw speech, such as voiceprint, which may be crucial for robots to successfully complete customized tasks. To overcome above challenges, we propose VLAS, a novel end-to-end VLA that integrates speech recognition directly into the robot policy model. VLAS allows the robot to understand spoken commands through inner speech-text alignment and produces corresponding actions to fulfill the task. We also present two new datasets, SQA and CSI, to support a three-stage tuning process for speech instructions, which empowers VLAS with the ability of multimodal interaction across text, image, speech, and robot actions. Taking a step further, a voice retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) paradigm is designed to enable our model to effectively handle tasks that require individual-specific knowledge. Our extensive experiments show that VLAS can effectively accomplish robot manipulation tasks with diverse speech commands, offering a seamless and customized interaction experience.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a conference paper at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

However, it is non-trivial to translate human language instructions all the way to low-level leg joint actions. We propose NaVILA, a 2-level framework that unifies a Vision-Language-Action model (VLA) with locomotion skills. Instead of directly predicting low-level actions from VLA, NaVILA first generates mid-level actions with spatial information in the form of language, (e.g., "moving forward 75cm"), which serves as an input for a visual locomotion RL policy for execution. NaVILA substantially improves previous approaches on existing benchmarks. The same advantages are demonstrated in our newly developed benchmarks with IsaacLab, featuring more realistic scenes, low-level controls, and real-world robot experiments.

One fundamental challenge is the lack of robotic data, which are typically obtained through expensive on-robot operation. A promising remedy is to leverage cheaper, off-domain data such as action-free videos, hand-drawn sketches or simulation data. In this work, we posit that hierarchical vision-language-action (VLA) models can be more effective in utilizing off-domain data than standard monolithic VLA models that directly finetune vision-language models (VLMs) to predict actions. In particular, we study a class of hierarchical VLA models, where the high-level VLM is finetuned to produce a coarse 2D path indicating the desired robot end-effector trajectory given an RGB image and a task description. The intermediate 2D path prediction is then served as guidance to the low-level, 3D-aware control policy capable of precise manipulation. Doing so alleviates the high-level VLM from fine-grained action prediction, while reducing the low-level policy's burden on complex task-level reasoning. We show that, with the hierarchical design, the high-level VLM can transfer across significant domain gaps between the off-domain finetuning data and real-robot testing scenarios, including differences on embodiments, dynamics, visual appearances and task semantics, etc. In the real-robot experiments, we observe an average of 20% improvement in success rate across seven different axes of generalization over OpenVLA, representing a 50% relative gain.

RoboMIND is collected through human teleoperation and encompasses comprehensive robotic-related information, including multi-view observations, proprioceptive robot state information, and linguistic task descriptions. To ensure data consistency and reliability for imitation learning, RoboMIND is built on a unified data collection platform and a standardized protocol, covering four distinct robotic embodiments: the Franka Emika Panda, the UR5e, the AgileX dual-arm robot, and a humanoid robot with dual dexterous hands. Our dataset also includes 5k real-world failure demonstrations, each accompanied by detailed causes, enabling failure reflection and correction during policy learning. Additionally, we created a digital twin environment in the Isaac Sim simulator, replicating the real-world tasks and assets, which facilitates the low-cost collection of additional training data and enables efficient evaluation. To demonstrate the quality and diversity of our dataset, we conducted extensive experiments using various imitation learning methods for single-task settings and state-of-the-art Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for multi-task scenarios. By leveraging RoboMIND, the VLA models achieved high manipulation success rates and demonstrated strong generalization capabilities.

A key challenge is how to mitigate compounding errors in imitation learning, which lead to cascading failures over extended trajectories. To address these challenges, we propose the Diffusion Trajectory-guided Policy (DTP) framework, which generates 2D trajectories through a diffusion model to guide policy learning for long-horizon tasks. By leveraging task-relevant trajectories, DTP provides trajectory-level guidance to reduce error accumulation. Our two-stage approach first trains a generative vision-language model to create diffusion-based trajectories, then refines the imitation policy using them. Experiments on the CALVIN benchmark show that DTP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 25% in success rate, starting from scratch without external pretraining. Moreover, DTP significantly improves real-world robot performance.</p></details> |  |

However, the majority of existing VLAs fail to account for the inevitable external perturbations encountered during deployment. These perturbations introduce unforeseen state information to the VLA, resulting in inaccurate actions and consequently, a significant decline in generalization performance. The classic internal model control (IMC) principle demonstrates that a closed-loop system with an internal model that includes external input signals can accurately track the reference input and effectively offset the disturbance. We propose a novel closed-loop VLA method GEVRM that integrates the IMC principle to enhance the robustness of robot visual manipulation. The text-guided video generation model in GEVRM can generate highly expressive future visual planning goals. Simultaneously, we evaluate perturbations by simulating responses, which are called internal embeddings and optimized through prototype contrastive learning. This allows the model to implicitly infer and distinguish perturbations from the external environment. The proposed GEVRM achieves state-of-the-art performance on both standard and perturbed CALVIN benchmarks and shows significant improvements in realistic robot tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

While vision-language-action (VLA) models have shown promise for generalizable robot skills, realizing their full potential requires addressing limitations in action representation and efficient training. Current VLA models often focus on scaling the vision-language model (VLM) component, while the action space representation remains a critical bottleneck. This paper introduces DexVLA, a novel framework designed to enhance the efficiency and generalization capabilities of VLAs for complex, long-horizon tasks across diverse robot embodiments. DexVLA features a novel diffusion-based action expert, scaled to one billion parameters, designed for cross-embodiment learning. A novel embodiment curriculum learning strategy facilitates efficient training: (1) pre-training the diffusion expert that is separable from the VLA on cross-embodiment data, (2) aligning the VLA model to specific embodiments, and (3) post-training for rapid adaptation to new tasks. We conduct comprehensive experiments across multiple embodiments, including single-arm, bimanual, and dexterous hand, demonstrating DexVLA's adaptability to challenging tasks without task-specific adaptation, its ability to learn dexterous skills on novel embodiments with limited data, and its capacity to complete complex, long-horizon tasks using only direct language prompting, such as laundry folding. In all settings, our method demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art models like Octo, OpenVLA, and Diffusion Policy.</p></details> | <details><summary>The w...</summary><p>The webpage is at https://dex-vla.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Probing a Vision-Language-Action Model for Symbolic States and Integration into a Cognitive Architecture](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04558v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language-action (VLA) models hold promise as generalist robotics solutions by translating visual and linguistic inputs into robot actions, yet they lack reliability due to their black-box nature and sensitivity to environmental changes. In contrast, cognitive architectures (CA) excel in symbolic reasoning and state monitoring but are constrained by rigid predefined execution. This work bridges these approaches by probing OpenVLA's hidden layers to uncover symbolic representations of object properties, relations, and action states, enabling integration with a CA for enhanced interpretability and robustness. Through experiments on LIBERO-spatial pick-and-place tasks, we analyze the encoding of symbolic states across different layers of OpenVLA's Llama backbone. Our probing results show consistently high accuracies (> 0.90) for both object and action states across most layers, though contrary to our hypotheses, we did not observe the expected pattern of object states being encoded earlier than action states. We demonstrate an integrated DIARC-OpenVLA system that leverages these symbolic representations for real-time state monitoring, laying the foundation for more interpretable and reliable robotic manipulation.</p></details> | 8 Pages, 4 Figures |
| **[Towards Synergistic, Generalized, and Efficient Dual-System for Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08001v3)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing demand for versatile robotic systems to operate in diverse and dynamic environments has emphasized the importance of a generalist policy, which leverages a large cross-embodiment data corpus to facilitate broad adaptability and high-level reasoning. However, the generalist would struggle with inefficient inference and cost-expensive training. The specialist policy, instead, is curated for specific domain data and excels at task-level precision with efficiency. Yet, it lacks the generalization capacity for a wide range of applications. Inspired by these observations, we introduce RoboDual, a synergistic dual-system that supplements the merits of both generalist and specialist policy. A diffusion transformer-based specialist is devised for multi-step action rollouts, exquisitely conditioned on the high-level task understanding and discretized action output of a vision-language-action (VLA) based generalist. Compared to OpenVLA, RoboDual achieves 26.7% improvement in real-world setting and 12% gain on CALVIN by introducing a specialist policy with merely 20M trainable parameters. It maintains strong performance with 5% of demonstration data only, and enables a 3.8 times higher control frequency in real-world deployment. Code would be made publicly available.

Existing models for embodied navigation fall short of serving as practical generalists in the real world, as they are often constrained by specific task configurations or pre-defined maps with discretized waypoints. In this work, we present Uni-NaVid, the first video-based vision-language-action (VLA) model designed to unify diverse embodied navigation tasks and enable seamless navigation for mixed long-horizon tasks in unseen real-world environments. Uni-NaVid achieves this by harmonizing the input and output data configurations for all commonly used embodied navigation tasks and thereby integrating all tasks in one model. For training Uni-NaVid, we collect 3.6 million navigation data samples in total from four essential navigation sub-tasks and foster synergy in learning across them. Extensive experiments on comprehensive navigation benchmarks clearly demonstrate the advantages of unification modeling in Uni-NaVid and show it achieves state-of-the-art performance. Additionally, real-world experiments confirm the model's effectiveness and efficiency, shedding light on its strong generalizability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://pku-epic.github.io/Uni-NaVid/</p></details> |
| **[An Atomic Skill Library Construction Method for Data-Efficient Embodied Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15068v3)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied manipulation is a fundamental ability in the realm of embodied artificial intelligence. Although current embodied manipulation models show certain generalizations in specific settings, they struggle in new environments and tasks due to the complexity and diversity of real-world scenarios. The traditional end-to-end data collection and training manner leads to significant data demands. Decomposing end-to-end tasks into atomic skills helps reduce data requirements and improves the task success rate. However, existing methods are limited by predefined skill sets that cannot be dynamically updated. To address the issue, we introduce a three-wheeled data-driven method to build an atomic skill library. We divide tasks into subtasks using the Vision-Language-Planning (VLP). Then, atomic skill definitions are formed by abstracting the subtasks. Finally, an atomic skill library is constructed via data collection and Vision-Language-Action (VLA) fine-tuning. As the atomic skill library expands dynamically with the three-wheel update strategy, the range of tasks it can cover grows naturally. In this way, our method shifts focus from end-to-end tasks to atomic skills, significantly reducing data costs while maintaining high performance and enabling efficient adaptation to new tasks. Extensive experiments in real-world settings demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[QUAR-VLA: Vision-Language-Action Model for Quadruped Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14457v6)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The important manifestation of robot intelligence is the ability to naturally interact and autonomously make decisions. Traditional approaches to robot control often compartmentalize perception, planning, and decision-making, simplifying system design but limiting the synergy between different information streams. This compartmentalization poses challenges in achieving seamless autonomous reasoning, decision-making, and action execution. To address these limitations, a novel paradigm, named Vision-Language-Action tasks for QUAdruped Robots (QUAR-VLA), has been introduced in this paper. This approach tightly integrates visual information and instructions to generate executable actions, effectively merging perception, planning, and decision-making. The central idea is to elevate the overall intelligence of the robot. Within this framework, a notable challenge lies in aligning fine-grained instructions with visual perception information. This emphasizes the complexity involved in ensuring that the robot accurately interprets and acts upon detailed instructions in harmony with its visual observations. Consequently, we propose QUAdruped Robotic Transformer (QUART), a family of VLA models to integrate visual information and instructions from diverse modalities as input and generates executable actions for real-world robots and present QUAdruped Robot Dataset (QUARD), a large-scale multi-task dataset including navigation, complex terrain locomotion, and whole-body manipulation tasks for training QUART models. Our extensive evaluation (4000 evaluation trials) shows that our approach leads to performant robotic policies and enables QUART to obtain a range of emergent capabilities.</p></details> | Accepted by ECCV2024 |

While the performance of VLA models is promising, their computational cost can be substantial. This raises challenge for applying them on robotics tasks, which requires real-time decision-making to respond quickly to environmental changes. Since robotic control involves sequential decision-making, the visual input often exhibits minimal variation between successive steps. A natural idea is to reuse the computational results of unchanged visual tokens from the last step. Motivated by this idea, we propose VLA-Cache, an efficient vision-language-action model. VLA-Cache incorporates a token-selection mechanism that compares the visual input at each step with the input from the previous step, adaptively identifying visual tokens with minimal changes. The computational results for these unchanged tokens are then reused in subsequent steps via KV-cache, thereby significantly improving the efficiency of the VLA-Cache model. Experimental results on both simulation (e.g., LIBERO benchmark and SIMPLER) and real-world robot valid VLA-Cache can achieve practical acceleration with minimal sacrifice in success rate.</p></details> |  |

Furthermore, they are typically fine-tuned to replicate demonstrations collected by experts under different settings, thus introducing distribution bias and limiting their adaptability to diverse manipulation objectives, such as efficiency, safety, and task completion. To bridge this gap, we introduce GRAPE: Generalizing Robot Policy via Preference Alignment. Specifically, GRAPE aligns VLAs on a trajectory level and implicitly models reward from both successful and failure trials to boost generalizability to diverse tasks. Moreover, GRAPE breaks down complex manipulation tasks to independent stages and automatically guides preference modeling through customized spatiotemporal constraints with keypoints proposed by a large vision-language model. Notably, these constraints are flexible and can be customized to align the model with varying objectives, such as safety, efficiency, or task success. We evaluate GRAPE across a diverse array of tasks in both real-world and simulated environments. Experimental results demonstrate that GRAPE enhances the performance of state-of-the-art VLA models, increasing success rates on in-domain and unseen manipulation tasks by 51.79% and 58.20%, respectively. Additionally, GRAPE can be aligned with various objectives, such as safety and efficiency, reducing collision rates by 37.44% and rollout step-length by 11.15%, respectively.

However, these systems are often hindered by high computational costs, the need for extensive retraining, and limited scalability, making them less accessible for widespread use. In this paper, we introduce SVLR (Scalable Visual Language Robotics), an open-source, modular framework that operates without the need for retraining, providing a scalable solution for robotic control. SVLR leverages a combination of lightweight, open-source AI models including the Vision-Language Model (VLM) Mini-InternVL, zero-shot image segmentation model CLIPSeg, Large Language Model Phi-3, and sentence similarity model all-MiniLM to process visual and language inputs. These models work together to identify objects in an unknown environment, use them as parameters for task execution, and generate a sequence of actions in response to natural language instructions. A key strength of SVLR is its scalability. The framework allows for easy integration of new robotic tasks and robots by simply adding text descriptions and task definitions, without the need for retraining. This modularity ensures that SVLR can continuously adapt to the latest advancements in AI technologies and support a wide range of robots and tasks. SVLR operates effectively on an NVIDIA RTX 2070 (mobile) GPU, demonstrating promising performance in executing pick-and-place tasks. While these initial results are encouraging, further evaluation across a broader set of tasks and comparisons with existing VLA models are needed to assess SVLR's generalization capabilities and performance in more complex scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, the success comes at a cost. Their reliance on VLM backends with billions of parameters leads to high computational costs and inference latency, limiting the testing scenarios to mainly quasi-static tasks and hindering performance in dynamic tasks requiring rapid interactions. To address these limitations, this paper proposes HiRT, a Hierarchical Robot Transformer framework that enables flexible frequency and performance trade-off. HiRT keeps VLMs running at low frequencies to capture temporarily invariant features while enabling real-time interaction through a high-frequency vision-based policy guided by the slowly updated features. Experiment results in both simulation and real-world settings demonstrate significant improvements over baseline methods. Empirically, in static tasks, we double the control frequency and achieve comparable success rates. Additionally, on novel real-world dynamic ma nipulation tasks which are challenging for previous VLA models, HiRT improves the success rate from 48% to 75%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CORL 2024</p></details> |

VLMs, typically pre-trained on vision-language understanding tasks, provide rich semantic knowledge and reasoning abilities. However, prior research has shown that VLMs often focus on high-level semantic content and neglect low-level features, limiting their ability to capture detailed spatial information and understand physical dynamics. These aspects, which are crucial for embodied control tasks, remain underexplored in existing pre-training paradigms. In this paper, we investigate the training paradigm for VLAs, and introduce \textbf{UP-VLA}, a \textbf{U}nified VLA model training with both multi-modal \textbf{U}nderstanding and future \textbf{P}rediction objectives, enhancing both high-level semantic comprehension and low-level spatial understanding. Experimental results show that UP-VLA achieves a 33% improvement on the Calvin ABC-D benchmark compared to the previous state-of-the-art method. Additionally, UP-VLA demonstrates improved success rates in real-world manipulation tasks, particularly those requiring precise spatial information.</p></details> |  |

However, directly adapting a pretrained VLM for robotic control remains challenging, particularly when constrained by a limited number of robot demonstrations. In this work, we introduce LLaRA: Large Language and Robotics Assistant, a framework that formulates robot action policy as visuo-textual conversations and enables an efficient transfer of a pretrained VLM into a powerful VLA, motivated by the success of visual instruction tuning in Computer Vision. First, we present an automated pipeline to generate conversation-style instruction tuning data for robots from existing behavior cloning datasets, aligning robotic actions with image pixel coordinates. Further, we enhance this dataset in a self-supervised manner by defining six auxiliary tasks, without requiring any additional action annotations. We show that a VLM finetuned with a limited amount of such datasets can produce meaningful action decisions for robotic control. Through experiments across multiple simulated and real-world tasks, we demonstrate that LLaRA achieves state-of-the-art performance while preserving the generalization capabilities of large language models.

Although the VLA models are powerful, how to improve these large models during interaction with environments remains an open question. In this paper, we explore how to further improve these VLA models via Reinforcement Learning (RL), a commonly used fine-tuning technique for large models. However, we find that directly applying online RL to large VLA models presents significant challenges, including training instability that severely impacts the performance of large models, and computing burdens that exceed the capabilities of most local machines. To address these challenges, we propose iRe-VLA framework, which iterates between Reinforcement Learning and Supervised Learning to effectively improve VLA models, leveraging the exploratory benefits of RL while maintaining the stability of supervised learning.

For example, cutting the carrot requires adhering to a geometric constraint: the blade of the knife should be perpendicular to the carrot's direction. By interpreting these constraints through symbolic language representations and translating them into low-level actions, GeoManip bridges the gap between natural language and robotic execution, enabling greater generalizability across diverse even unseen tasks, objects, and scenarios. Unlike vision-language-action models that require extensive training, operates training-free by utilizing large foundational models: a constraint generation module that predicts stage-specific geometric constraints and a geometry parser that identifies object parts involved in these constraints. A solver then optimizes trajectories to satisfy inferred constraints from task descriptions and the scene. Furthermore, GeoManip learns in-context and provides five appealing human-robot interaction features: on-the-fly policy adaptation, learning from human demonstrations, learning from failure cases, long-horizon action planning, and efficient data collection for imitation learning. Extensive evaluations on both simulations and real-world scenarios demonstrate GeoManip's state-of-the-art performance, with superior out-of-distribution generalization while avoiding costly model training.</p></details> | 32 pages, 13 figures |

However, such models require us to choose a tokenization of our continuous action signals, which determines how the discrete symbols predicted by the model map to continuous robot actions. We find that current approaches for robot action tokenization, based on simple per-dimension, per-timestep binning schemes, typically perform poorly when learning dexterous skills from high-frequency robot data. To address this challenge, we propose a new compression-based tokenization scheme for robot actions, based on the discrete cosine transform. Our tokenization approach, Frequency-space Action Sequence Tokenization (FAST), enables us to train autoregressive VLAs for highly dexterous and high-frequency tasks where standard discretization methods fail completely. Based on FAST, we release FAST+, a universal robot action tokenizer, trained on 1M real robot action trajectories. It can be used as a black-box tokenizer for a wide range of robot action sequences, with diverse action spaces and control frequencies. Finally, we show that, when combined with the pi0 VLA, our method can scale to training on 10k hours of robot data and match the performance of diffusion VLAs, while reducing training time by up to 5x.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: https://www.pi.website/research/fast</p></details> |

For example, when vision is occluded reaching into a bag, a robot should rely on its senses of touch and sound. However, state-of-the-art generalist robot policies are typically trained on large datasets to predict robot actions solely from visual and proprioceptive observations. In this work, we propose FuSe, a novel approach that enables finetuning visuomotor generalist policies on heterogeneous sensor modalities for which large datasets are not readily available by leveraging natural language as a common cross-modal grounding. We combine a multimodal contrastive loss with a sensory-grounded language generation loss to encode high-level semantics. In the context of robot manipulation, we show that FuSe enables performing challenging tasks that require reasoning jointly over modalities such as vision, touch, and sound in a zero-shot setting, such as multimodal prompting, compositional cross-modal prompting, and descriptions of objects it interacts with. We show that the same recipe is applicable to widely different generalist policies, including both diffusion-based generalist policies and large vision-language-action (VLA) models. Extensive experiments in the real world show that FuSeis able to increase success rates by over 20% compared to all considered baselines.</p></details> |  |

While Vision-Language Models(VLM) excel in high-level commonsense reasoning, they lack the fine-grained 3D spatial understanding required for precise manipulation tasks. Fine-tuning VLM on robotic datasets to create Vision-Language-Action Models(VLA) is a potential solution, but it is hindered by high data collection costs and generalization issues. To address these challenges, we propose a novel object-centric representation that bridges the gap between VLM's high-level reasoning and the low-level precision required for manipulation. Our key insight is that an object's canonical space, defined by its functional affordances, provides a structured and semantically meaningful way to describe interaction primitives, such as points and directions. These primitives act as a bridge, translating VLM's commonsense reasoning into actionable 3D spatial constraints. In this context, we introduce a dual closed-loop, open-vocabulary robotic manipulation system: one loop for high-level planning through primitive resampling, interaction rendering and VLM checking, and another for low-level execution via 6D pose tracking. This design ensures robust, real-time control without requiring VLM fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate strong zero-shot generalization across diverse robotic manipulation tasks, highlighting the potential of this approach for automating large-scale simulation data generation.</p></details> |  |

Multimodal large language models (MLLMs), in particular, learn from vast and diverse data sources, allowing rich and nuanced representations of the world and, thereby, providing extensive capabilities, including the ability to reason, engage in meaningful dialog; collaborate with humans and other agents to jointly solve complex problems; and understand social and emotional aspects of humans. Despite this impressive feat, the cognitive abilities of state-of-the-art LLMs trained on large-scale datasets are still superficial and brittle. Consequently, generic LLMs are severely limited in their generalist capabilities. A number of foundational problems -- embodiment, symbol grounding, causality and memory -- are required to be addressed for LLMs to attain human-level general intelligence. These concepts are more aligned with human cognition and provide LLMs with inherent human-like cognitive properties that support the realization of physically-plausible, semantically meaningful, flexible and more generalizable knowledge and intelligence. In this work, we discuss the aforementioned foundational issues and survey state-of-the art approaches for implementing these concepts in LLMs. Specifically, we discuss how the principles of embodiment, symbol grounding, causality and memory can be leveraged toward the attainment of artificial general intelligence (AGI) in an organic manner.</p></details> |  |

OpenAI recent model, o1, showcased impressive capabilities in solving complex problems by utilizing extensive reasoning chains. This prompts an important question: can robot models achieve better performance in multi-task, complex environments by reviewing prior observations and then providing task-specific reasoning to guide action prediction? In this paper, we introduce \textbf{Chain-of-Affordance (CoA)}, a novel approach to scaling robot models by incorporating reasoning in the format of sequential robot affordances to facilitate task completion. Specifically, we prompt the model to consider the following four types of affordances before taking action: a) object affordance - what object to manipulate and where it is; b) grasp affordance - the specific object part to grasp; c) spatial affordance - the optimal space to place the object; and d) movement affordance - the collision-free path for movement. By integrating this knowledge into the policy model, the robot gains essential context, allowing it to act with increased precision and robustness during inference. Our experiments demonstrate that CoA achieves superior performance than state-of-the-art robot foundation models, such as OpenVLA and Octo. Additionally, CoA shows strong generalization to unseen object poses, identifies free space, and avoids obstacles in novel environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project webpage is available at https://chain-of-affordance.github.io</p></details> |

To better define such general-purpose tasks in the context of LLMs and advance the research in VLAs, we present VLABench, an open-source benchmark for evaluating universal LCM task learning. VLABench provides 100 carefully designed categories of tasks, with strong randomization in each category of task and a total of 2000+ objects. VLABench stands out from previous benchmarks in four key aspects: 1) tasks requiring world knowledge and common sense transfer, 2) natural language instructions with implicit human intentions rather than templates, 3) long-horizon tasks demanding multi-step reasoning, and 4) evaluation of both action policies and language model capabilities. The benchmark assesses multiple competencies including understanding of mesh\&texture, spatial relationship, semantic instruction, physical laws, knowledge transfer and reasoning, etc. To support the downstream finetuning, we provide high-quality training data collected via an automated framework incorporating heuristic skills and prior information. The experimental results indicate that both the current state-of-the-art pretrained VLAs and the workflow based on VLMs face challenges in our tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Generalist Robot Policies: What Matters in Building Vision-Language-Action Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14058v3)** | 2024-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation Vision Language Models (VLMs) exhibit strong capabilities in multi-modal representation learning, comprehension, and reasoning. By injecting action components into the VLMs, Vision-Language-Action Models (VLAs) can be naturally formed and also show promising performance. Existing work has demonstrated the effectiveness and generalization of VLAs in multiple scenarios and tasks. Nevertheless, the transfer from VLMs to VLAs is not trivial since existing VLAs differ in their backbones, action-prediction formulations, data distributions, and training recipes. This leads to a missing piece for a systematic understanding of the design choices of VLAs. In this work, we disclose the key factors that significantly influence the performance of VLA and focus on answering three essential design choices: which backbone to select, how to formulate the VLA architectures, and when to add cross-embodiment data. The obtained results convince us firmly to explain why we need VLA and develop a new family of VLAs, RoboVLMs, which require very few manual designs and achieve a new state-of-the-art performance in three simulation tasks and real-world experiments. Through our extensive experiments, which include over 8 VLM backbones, 4 policy architectures, and over 600 distinct designed experiments, we provide a detailed guidebook for the future design of VLAs. In addition to the study, the highly flexible RoboVLMs framework, which supports easy integrations of new VLMs and free combinations of various design choices, is made public to facilitate future research. We open-source all details, including codes, models, datasets, and toolkits, along with detailed training and evaluation recipes at: robovlms.github.io.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: robovlms.github.io.

This paper proposes a modular approach, where each step of the manipulation process is addressed with dedicated policies based on effective modality input, rather than relying on a single end-to-end model. To demonstrate this, a dexterous robotic hand performs a manipulation task involving picking up and rotating a box. Guided by insights from neuroscience, the task is decomposed into three sub-skills, 1)reaching, 2)grasping and lifting, and 3)in-hand rotation, based on the dominant sensory modalities employed in the human brain. Each sub-skill is addressed using distinct methods from a practical perspective: a classical controller, a Vision-Language-Action model, and a reinforcement learning policy with force feedback, respectively. We tested the pipeline on a real robot to demonstrate the feasibility of our approach. The key contribution of this study lies in presenting a neuroscience-inspired, modality-driven methodology for multi-step dexterous manipulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables.

Although existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for robots can handle a range of basic tasks, they still face challenges in two areas: (1) insufficient reasoning ability to tackle complex tasks, and (2) high computational costs for VLA model fine-tuning and inference. The recently proposed state space model (SSM) known as Mamba demonstrates promising capabilities in non-trivial sequence modeling with linear inference complexity. Inspired by this, we introduce RoboMamba, an end-to-end robotic VLA model that leverages Mamba to deliver both robotic reasoning and action capabilities, while maintaining efficient fine-tuning and inference. Specifically, we first integrate the vision encoder with Mamba, aligning visual tokens with language embedding through co-training, empowering our model with visual common sense and robotic-related reasoning. To further equip RoboMamba with SE(3) pose prediction abilities, we explore an efficient fine-tuning strategy with a simple policy head. We find that once RoboMamba possesses sufficient reasoning capability, it can acquire manipulation skills with minimal fine-tuning parameters (0.1\% of the model) and time. In experiments, RoboMamba demonstrates outstanding reasoning capabilities on general and robotic evaluation benchmarks. Meanwhile, our model showcases impressive pose prediction results in both simulation and real-world experiments, achieving inference speeds 3 times faster than existing VLA models.

However, systematic evaluation of these models across diverse robotic tasks remains limited. In this work, we present a comprehensive evaluation framework and benchmark suite for assessing VLA models. We profile three state-of-the-art VLM and VLAs - GPT-4o, OpenVLA, and JAT - across 20 diverse datasets from the Open-X-Embodiment collection, evaluating their performance on various manipulation tasks. Our analysis reveals several key insights: 1. current VLA models show significant variation in performance across different tasks and robot platforms, with GPT-4o demonstrating the most consistent performance through sophisticated prompt engineering, 2. all models struggle with complex manipulation tasks requiring multi-step planning, and 3. model performance is notably sensitive to action space characteristics and environmental factors. We release our evaluation framework and findings to facilitate systematic assessment of future VLA models and identify critical areas for improvement in the development of general purpose robotic systems.</p></details> | 16 Pages, 10 Figures |

While Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer a promising avenue for this, their use has been largely confined to understanding complex environmental contexts or generating high-level driving commands, with few studies extending their application to end-to-end path planning. A major research bottleneck is the lack of large-scale annotated datasets encompassing vision, language, and action. To address this issue, we propose CoVLA (Comprehensive Vision-Language-Action) Dataset, an extensive dataset comprising real-world driving videos spanning more than 80 hours. This dataset leverages a novel, scalable approach based on automated data processing and a caption generation pipeline to generate accurate driving trajectories paired with detailed natural language descriptions of driving environments and maneuvers. This approach utilizes raw in-vehicle sensor data, allowing it to surpass existing datasets in scale and annotation richness. Using CoVLA, we investigate the driving capabilities of MLLMs that can handle vision, language, and action in a variety of driving scenarios. Our results illustrate the strong proficiency of our model in generating coherent language and action outputs, emphasizing the potential of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in the field of autonomous driving. This dataset establishes a framework for robust, interpretable, and data-driven autonomous driving systems by providing a comprehensive platform for training and evaluating VLA models, contributing to safer and more reliable self-driving vehicles.

However, scaling these models greatly increases computational costs, which presents challenges in fields like robot manipulation and autonomous driving that require quick, accurate responses. To address the need for deployment on resource-limited hardware, we propose a new quantization framework for IL-based policy models that fine-tunes parameters to enhance robustness against low-bit precision errors during training, thereby maintaining efficiency and reliability under constrained conditions. Our evaluations with representative robot manipulation for 4-bit weight-quantization on a real edge GPU demonstrate that our framework achieves up to 2.5x speedup and 2.5x energy savings while preserving accuracy. For 4-bit weight and activation quantized self-driving models, the framework achieves up to 3.7x speedup and 3.1x energy saving on a low-end GPU. These results highlight the practical potential of deploying IL-based policy models on resource-constrained devices.</p></details> |  |

How to equip 3D autonomous characters with similar social intelligence that can perceive, understand and interact with humans remains an open yet foundamental problem. In this paper, we introduce SOLAMI, the first end-to-end Social vision-Language-Action (VLA) Modeling framework for Immersive interaction with 3D autonomous characters. Specifically, SOLAMI builds 3D autonomous characters from three aspects: (1) Social VLA Architecture: We propose a unified social VLA framework to generate multimodal response (speech and motion) based on the user's multimodal input to drive the character for social interaction. (2) Interactive Multimodal Data: We present SynMSI, a synthetic multimodal social interaction dataset generated by an automatic pipeline using only existing motion datasets to address the issue of data scarcity. (3) Immersive VR Interface: We develop a VR interface that enables users to immersively interact with these characters driven by various architectures. Extensive quantitative experiments and user studies demonstrate that our framework leads to more precise and natural character responses (in both speech and motion) that align with user expectations with lower latency.</p></details> |  |

While existing VLAs adapted from pretrained large Vision-Language-Models (VLM) have demonstrated promising generalizability, their task performance is still unsatisfactory as indicated by the low tasks success rates in different environments. In this paper, we present a new advanced VLA architecture derived from VLM. Unlike previous works that directly repurpose VLM for action prediction by simple action quantization, we propose a omponentized VLA architecture that has a specialized action module conditioned on VLM output. We systematically study the design of the action module and demonstrates the strong performance enhancement with diffusion action transformers for action sequence modeling, as well as their favorable scaling behaviors. We also conduct comprehensive experiments and ablation studies to evaluate the efficacy of our models with varied designs. The evaluation on 5 robot embodiments in simulation and real work shows that our model not only significantly surpasses existing VLAs in task performance and but also exhibits remarkable adaptation to new robots and generalization to unseen objects and backgrounds. It exceeds the average success rates of OpenVLA which has similar model size (7B) with ours by over 35% in simulated evaluation and 55% in real robot experiments.

While most agents are language-based, relying on closed-source API with text-rich meta-information (e.g., HTML or accessibility tree), they show limitations in perceiving UI visuals as humans do, highlighting the need for GUI visual agents. In this work, we develop a vision-language-action model in digital world, namely ShowUI, which features the following innovations: (i) UI-Guided Visual Token Selection to reduce computational costs by formulating screenshots as an UI connected graph, adaptively identifying their redundant relationship and serve as the criteria for token selection during self-attention blocks; (ii) Interleaved Vision-Language-Action Streaming that flexibly unifies diverse needs within GUI tasks, enabling effective management of visual-action history in navigation or pairing multi-turn query-action sequences per screenshot to enhance training efficiency; (iii) Small-scale High-quality GUI Instruction-following Datasets by careful data curation and employing a resampling strategy to address significant data type imbalances. With above components, ShowUI, a lightweight 2B model using 256K data, achieves a strong 75.1% accuracy in zero-shot screenshot grounding. Its UI-guided token selection further reduces 33% of redundant visual tokens during training and speeds up the performance by 1.4x. Navigation experiments across web Mind2Web, mobile AITW, and online MiniWob environments further underscore the effectiveness and potential of our model in advancing GUI visual agents.

However, current VLA models face significant challenges: they are slow during inference and require extensive pre-training on large amounts of robotic data, making real-world deployment difficult. In this paper, we introduce a new family of compact vision-language-action models, called TinyVLA, which offers two key advantages over existing VLA models: (1) faster inference speeds, and (2) improved data efficiency, eliminating the need for pre-training stage. Our framework incorporates two essential components to build TinyVLA: (1) initializing the policy backbone with robust, high-speed multimodal models, and (2) integrating a diffusion policy decoder during fine-tuning to enable precise robot actions. We conducted extensive evaluations of TinyVLA in both simulation and on real robots, demonstrating that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art VLA model, OpenVLA, in terms of speed and data efficiency, while delivering comparable or superior performance. Additionally, TinyVLA exhibits strong generalization capabilities across various dimensions, including language instructions, novel objects, unseen positions, changes in object appearance, background variations, and environmental shifts, often matching or exceeding the performance of OpenVLA.

However, bringing robot learning to the level of generality required for effective real-world systems faces major obstacles in terms of data, generalization, and robustness. In this paper, we discuss how generalist robot policies (i.e., robot foundation models) can address these challenges, and how we can design effective generalist robot policies for complex and highly dexterous tasks. We propose a novel flow matching architecture built on top of a pre-trained vision-language model (VLM) to inherit Internet-scale semantic knowledge. We then discuss how this model can be trained on a large and diverse dataset from multiple dexterous robot platforms, including single-arm robots, dual-arm robots, and mobile manipulators. We evaluate our model in terms of its ability to perform tasks in zero shot after pre-training, follow language instructions from people and from a high-level VLM policy, and its ability to acquire new skills via fine-tuning.

These advances have spurred the vision of establishing a generalist robotic MLLM proficient in understanding complex human instructions and accomplishing various embodied tasks. However, developing MLLMs for real-world robots is challenging due to the typically limited computation and memory capacities available on robotic platforms. In contrast, the inference of MLLMs involves storing billions of parameters and performing tremendous computation, imposing significant hardware demands. In our paper, we propose a Dynamic Early-Exit Framework for Robotic Vision-Language-Action Model (DeeR-VLA, or simply DeeR) that automatically adjusts the size of the activated MLLM based on each situation at hand. The approach leverages a multi-exit architecture in MLLMs, which allows the model to terminate processing once a proper size of the model has been activated for a specific situation, thus avoiding further redundant computation. Additionally, we develop novel algorithms that establish early-termination criteria for DeeR, conditioned on predefined demands such as average computational cost (i.e., power consumption), as well as peak computational consumption (i.e., latency) and GPU memory usage. These enhancements ensure that DeeR operates efficiently under varying resource constraints while maintaining competitive performance. On the CALVIN robot manipulation benchmark, DeeR demonstrates significant reductions in computational costs of LLM by 5.2-6.5x and GPU memory of LLM by 2-6x without compromising performance.

Since manipulation tasks involve direct interaction with the physical world, ensuring robustness and safety during the execution of this task is always a very critical issue. In this paper, by synthesizing current safety research on MLLMs and the specific application scenarios of the manipulation task in the physical world, we comprehensively evaluate VLAMs in the face of potential physical threats. Specifically, we propose the Physical Vulnerability Evaluating Pipeline (PVEP) that can incorporate as many visual modal physical threats as possible for evaluating the physical robustness of VLAMs. The physical threats in PVEP specifically include Out-of-Distribution, Typography-based Visual Prompts, and Adversarial Patch Attacks.

Previous works separately conduct visual grounding to localize the target object, and generate a grasp for that object. However, these works require object labels or visual attributes for grounding, which calls for handcrafted rules in planner and restricts the range of language instructions. In this paper, we propose to jointly model vision, language and action with object-centric representation. Our method is applicable under more flexible language instructions, and not limited by visual grounding error. Besides, by utilizing the powerful priors from the pre-trained multi-modal model and grasp model, sample efficiency is effectively improved and the sim2real problem is relived without additional data for transfer. A series of experiments carried out in simulation and real world indicate that our method can achieve better task success rate by less times of motion under more flexible language instructions.

Compared to prior works that either emit textual goals to separate controllers or produce the control command directly, OmniJARVIS seeks a different path to ensure both strong reasoning and efficient decision-making capabilities via unified tokenization of multimodal interaction data. First, we introduce a self-supervised approach to learn a behavior encoder that produces discretized tokens for behavior trajectories $\tau = \{o_0, a_0, \dots\}$ and an imitation learning policy decoder conditioned on these tokens. These additional behavior tokens will be augmented to the vocabulary of pretrained Multimodal Language Models. With this encoder, we then pack long-term multimodal interactions involving task instructions, memories, thoughts, observations, textual responses, behavior trajectories, etc into unified token sequences and model them with autoregressive transformers. Thanks to the semantically meaningful behavior tokens, the resulting VLA model, OmniJARVIS, can reason (by producing chain-of-thoughts), plan, answer questions, and act (by producing behavior tokens for the imitation learning policy decoder). OmniJARVIS demonstrates excellent performances on a comprehensive collection of atomic, programmatic, and open-ended tasks in open-world Minecraft. Our analysis further unveils the crucial design principles in interaction data formation, unified tokenization, and its scaling potentials.

The VLA model provides language commanded high-level planning, which is highly generalizable, while the diffusion model handles low-level interactions which offers the precision and robustness required for specific objects and environments. By incorporating a switching signal into the training-data, we enable event based transitions between these two models for a pick-and-place task where the target object and placement location is commanded through language. This approach is deployed on our anthropomorphic ADAPT Hand 2, a 13DoF robotic hand, which incorporates compliance through series elastic actuation allowing for resilience for any interactions: showing the first use of a multi-fingered hand controlled with a VLA model. We demonstrate this model switching approach results in a over 80\% success rate compared to under 40\% when only using a VLA model, enabled by accurate near-object arm motion by the VLA model and a multi-modal grasping motion with error recovery abilities from the diffusion model.</p></details> |  |

Existing Vision-Language-Action models require action labels typically collected by human teleoperators during pretraining, which significantly limits possible data sources and scale. In this work, we propose a method to learn from internet-scale videos that do not have robot action labels. We first train an action quantization model leveraging VQ-VAE-based objective to learn discrete latent actions between image frames, then pretrain a latent VLA model to predict these latent actions from observations and task descriptions, and finally finetune the VLA on small-scale robot manipulation data to map from latent to robot actions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing techniques that train robot manipulation policies from large-scale videos. Furthermore, it outperforms the state-of-the-art VLA model trained with robotic action labels on real-world manipulation tasks that require language conditioning, generalization to unseen objects, and semantic generalization to unseen instructions.

These models take camera images and natural language task instructions as input and directly generate control actions for robots to perform specified tasks, greatly improving both decision-making capabilities and interaction with human users. However, the data-driven nature of VLA models, combined with their lack of interpretability, makes the assurance of their effectiveness and robustness a challenging task. This highlights the need for a reliable testing and evaluation platform. For this purpose, in this work, we propose LADEV, a comprehensive and efficient platform specifically designed for evaluating VLA models. We first present a language-driven approach that automatically generates simulation environments from natural language inputs, mitigating the need for manual adjustments and significantly improving testing efficiency. Then, to further assess the influence of language input on the VLA models, we implement a paraphrase mechanism that produces diverse natural language task instructions for testing. Finally, to expedite the evaluation process, we introduce a batch-style method for conducting large-scale testing of VLA models. Using LADEV, we conducted experiments on several state-of-the-art VLA models, demonstrating its effectiveness as a tool for evaluating these models. Our results showed that LADEV not only enhances testing efficiency but also establishes a solid baseline for evaluating VLA models, paving the way for the development of more intelligent and advanced robotic systems.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

However, despite their large-scale training, VLAs are often brittle to task-irrelevant visual details such as distractor objects or background colors. We introduce Bring Your Own VLA (BYOVLA): a run-time intervention scheme that (1) dynamically identifies regions of the input image that the model is sensitive to, and (2) minimally alters task-irrelevant regions to reduce the model's sensitivity using automated image editing tools. Our approach is compatible with any off the shelf VLA without model fine-tuning or access to the model's weights. Hardware experiments on language-instructed manipulation tasks demonstrate that BYOVLA enables state-of-the-art VLA models to nearly retain their nominal performance in the presence of distractor objects and backgrounds, which otherwise degrade task success rates by up to 40%.

However, existing underwater visual SLAM datasets often lack groundtruth trajectory data, making it difficult to objectively compare the performance of different SLAM algorithms based solely on qualitative results or COLMAP reconstruction. In this paper, we present a novel underwater dataset that includes ground truth trajectory data obtained using a motion capture system. Additionally, for the first time, we release visual data that includes both events and frames for benchmarking underwater visual positioning. By providing event camera data, we aim to facilitate the development of more robust and advanced underwater visual SLAM algorithms. The use of event cameras can help mitigate challenges posed by extremely low light or hazy underwater conditions.

However, reliable camera pose estimation and scene reconstruction from such unconstrained videos remains an open challenge. Existing visual-only SLAM methods perform well on benchmark datasets but struggle with real-world footage which often exhibits uncontrolled motion including rapid rotations and pure forward movements, textureless regions, and dynamic objects. We analyze the limitations of current methods and introduce a robust pipeline designed to improve 3D reconstruction from casual videos. We build upon recent deep visual odometry methods but increase robustness in several ways. Camera intrinsics are automatically recovered from the first few frames using structure-from-motion. Dynamic objects and less-constrained areas are masked with a predictive model. Additionally, we leverage monocular depth estimates to regularize bundle adjustment, mitigating errors in low-parallax situations. Finally, we integrate place recognition and loop closure to reduce long-term drift and refine both intrinsics and pose estimates through global bundle adjustment. We demonstrate large-scale contiguous 3D models from several online videos in various environments. In contrast, baseline methods typically produce locally inconsistent results at several points, producing separate segments or distorted maps. In lieu of ground-truth pose data, we evaluate map consistency, execution time and visual accuracy of re-rendered NeRF models. Our proposed system establishes a new baseline for visual reconstruction from casual uncontrolled videos found online, demonstrating more consistent reconstructions over longer sequences of in-the-wild videos than previously achieved.</p></details> | <details><summary>fix t...</summary><p>fix the overview figure</p></details> |

| **[GroundSLAM: A Robust Visual SLAM System for Warehouse Robots Using Ground Textures](http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05502v4)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A robust visual localization and mapping system is essential for warehouse robot navigation, as cameras offer a more cost-effective alternative to LiDAR sensors. However, existing forward-facing camera systems often encounter challenges in dynamic environments and open spaces, leading to significant performance degradation during deployment. To address these limitations, a localization system utilizing a single downward-facing camera to capture ground textures presents a promising solution. Nevertheless, existing feature-based ground-texture localization methods face difficulties when operating on surfaces with sparse features or repetitive patterns. To address this limitation, we propose GroundSLAM, a novel feature-free and ground-texture-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) system. GroundSLAM consists of three components: feature-free visual odometry, ground-texture-based loop detection and map optimization, and map reuse. Specifically, we introduce a kernel cross-correlator (KCC) for image-level pose tracking, loop detection, and map reuse to improve localization accuracy and robustness, and incorporate adaptive pruning strategies to enhance efficiency. Due to these specific designs, GroundSLAM is able to deliver efficient and stable localization across various ground surfaces such as those with sparse features and repetitive patterns. To advance research in this area, we introduce the first ground-texture dataset with precise ground-truth poses, consisting of 131k images collected from 10 kinds of indoor and outdoor ground surfaces. Extensive experimental results show that GroundSLAM outperforms state-of-the-art methods for both indoor and outdoor localization. We release our code and dataset at https://github.com/sair-lab/GroundSLAM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Survey on Monocular Metric Depth Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11841v3)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) is a core task in computer vision that enables spatial understanding, 3D reconstruction, and autonomous navigation. Deep learning methods typically estimate relative depth from a single image, but the lack of metric scale often leads to geometric inconsistencies. This limitation severely impacts applications such as visual SLAM, detailed 3D modeling, and novel view synthesis. Monocular Metric Depth Estimation (MMDE) addresses this issue by producing depth maps with absolute scale, ensuring frame-to-frame consistency and supporting direct deployment without scale calibration. This paper presents a structured survey of depth estimation methods, tracing the evolution from traditional geometry-based approaches to modern deep learning models. Recent progress in MMDE is analyzed, with a focus on two key challenges: poor generalization and blurred object boundaries. To tackle these problems, researchers have explored various strategies, including self-supervised learning with unlabeled data, patch-based training, architectural enhancements, and generative model integration. Each method is discussed in terms of technical contribution, performance improvement, and remaining limitations. The survey consolidates recent findings, identifies unresolved challenges, and outlines future directions for MMDE. By highlighting key advancements and open problems, this paper aims to support the continued development and real-world adoption of metric depth estimation in computer vision.</p></details> |  |

We demonstrate the ease with which user-relevant benchmarks can be created: here, we introduce difficulty-level-based categories, but one could envision environment-specific or condition-specific categories.</p></details> |  |
| **[SuperEvent: Cross-Modal Learning of Event-based Keypoint Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00139v1)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event-based keypoint detection and matching holds significant potential, enabling the integration of event sensors into highly optimized Visual SLAM systems developed for frame cameras over decades of research. Unfortunately, existing approaches struggle with the motion-dependent appearance of keypoints and the complex noise prevalent in event streams, resulting in severely limited feature matching capabilities and poor performance on downstream tasks. To mitigate this problem, we propose SuperEvent, a data-driven approach to predict stable keypoints with expressive descriptors. Due to the absence of event datasets with ground truth keypoint labels, we leverage existing frame-based keypoint detectors on readily available event-aligned and synchronized gray-scale frames for self-supervision: we generate temporally sparse keypoint pseudo-labels considering that events are a product of both scene appearance and camera motion. Combined with our novel, information-rich event representation, we enable SuperEvent to effectively learn robust keypoint detection and description in event streams. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of SuperEvent by its integration into a modern sparse keypoint and descriptor-based SLAM framework originally developed for traditional cameras, surpassing the state-of-the-art in event-based SLAM by a wide margin.

| **[ROVER: A Multi-Season Dataset for Visual SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02506v2)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust SLAM is a crucial enabler for autonomous navigation in natural, semi-structured environments such as parks and gardens. However, these environments present unique challenges for SLAM due to frequent seasonal changes, varying light conditions, and dense vegetation. These factors often degrade the performance of visual SLAM algorithms originally developed for structured urban environments. To address this gap, we present ROVER, a comprehensive benchmark dataset tailored for evaluating visual SLAM algorithms under diverse environmental conditions and spatial configurations. We captured the dataset with a robotic platform equipped with monocular, stereo, and RGBD cameras, as well as inertial sensors. It covers 39 recordings across five outdoor locations, collected through all seasons and various lighting scenarios, i.e., day, dusk, and night with and without external lighting. With this novel dataset, we evaluate several traditional and deep learning-based SLAM methods and study their performance in diverse challenging conditions. The results demonstrate that while stereo-inertial and RGBD configurations generally perform better under favorable lighting and moderate vegetation, most SLAM systems perform poorly in low-light and high-vegetation scenarios, particularly during summer and autumn. Our analysis highlights the need for improved adaptability in visual SLAM algorithms for outdoor applications, as current systems struggle with dynamic environmental factors affecting scale, feature extraction, and trajectory consistency. This dataset provides a solid foundation for advancing visual SLAM research in real-world, semi-structured environments, fostering the development of more resilient SLAM systems for long-term outdoor localization and mapping. The dataset and the code of the benchmark are available under https://iis-esslingen.github.io/rover.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 9 figures, 12 tables</p></details> |
| **[MCVO: A Generic Visual Odometry for Arbitrarily Arranged Multi-Cameras](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03146v2)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Making multi-camera visual SLAM systems easier to set up and more robust to the environment is attractive for vision robots. Existing monocular and binocular vision SLAM systems have narrow sensing Field-of-View (FoV), resulting in degenerated accuracy and limited robustness in textureless environments. Thus multi-camera SLAM systems are gaining attention because they can provide redundancy with much wider FoV. However, the usual arbitrary placement and orientation of multiple cameras make the pose scale estimation and system updating challenging. To address these problems, we propose a robust visual odometry system for rigidly-bundled arbitrarily-arranged multi-cameras, namely MCVO, which can achieve metric-scale state estimation with high flexibility in the cameras' arrangement. Specifically, we first design a learning-based feature tracking framework to shift the pressure of CPU processing of multiple video streams to GPU. Then we initialize the odometry system with the metric-scale poses under the rigid constraints between moving cameras. Finally, we fuse the features of the multi-cameras in the back-end to achieve robust pose estimation and online scale optimization. Additionally, multi-camera features help improve the loop detection for pose graph optimization. Experiments on KITTI-360 and MultiCamData datasets validate its robustness over arbitrarily arranged cameras. Compared with other stereo and multi-camera visual SLAM systems, our method obtains higher pose accuracy with better generalization ability. Our codes and online demos are available at https://github.com/JunhaoWang615/MCVO</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Loop Closure from Two Views: Revisiting PGO for Scalable Trajectory Estimation through Monocular Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16275v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>(Visual) Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) remains a fundamental challenge in enabling autonomous systems to navigate and understand large-scale environments. Traditional SLAM approaches struggle to balance efficiency and accuracy, particularly in large-scale settings where extensive computational resources are required for scene reconstruction and Bundle Adjustment (BA). However, this scene reconstruction, in the form of sparse pointclouds of visual landmarks, is often only used within the SLAM system because navigation and planning methods require different map representations. In this work, we therefore investigate a more scalable Visual SLAM (VSLAM) approach without reconstruction, mainly based on approaches for two-view loop closures. By restricting the map to a sparse keyframed pose graph without dense geometry representations, our '2GO' system achieves efficient optimization with competitive absolute trajectory accuracy. In particular, we find that recent advancements in image matching and monocular depth priors enable very accurate trajectory optimization from two-view edges. We conduct extensive experiments on diverse datasets, including large-scale scenarios, and provide a detailed analysis of the trade-offs between runtime, accuracy, and map size. Our results demonstrate that this streamlined approach supports real-time performance, scales well in map size and trajectory duration, and effectively broadens the capabilities of VSLAM for long-duration deployments to large environments.</p></details> |  |

Our key innovation consists of augmenting the standard neural representation by a normalizing flow network. As a result, achieving strong representation power on the specific class of road vehicles is made possible by compact networks with only 16-dimensional latent codes. Furthermore, the newly proposed architecture exhibits a significant performance improvement in the presence of only sparse and noisy data, which is demonstrated through comparative experiments on synthetic data. The module is embedded into the back-end of a stereo-vision based framework for joint, incremental shape optimization. The loss function is given by a combination of a sparse 3D point-based SDF loss, a sparse rendering loss, and a semantic mask-based silhouette-consistency term. We furthermore leverage semantic information to determine keypoint extraction density in the front-end. Finally, experimental results on real-world data reveal accurate and reliable performance comparable to alternative frameworks that make use of direct depth readings. The proposed method performs well with only sparse 3D points obtained from bundle adjustment, and eventually continues to deliver stable results even under exclusive use of the mask-consistency term.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, IROS 2024</p></details> |

To address the critical challenge of achieving reliable localization in low-texture environments, where traditional point-based systems often fail due to insufficient visual features, we introduce a novel approach leveraging Global Primitives structural information to improve the system's robustness and accuracy performance. Our key innovation lies in constructing vanishing points from line features and proposing a weighted fusion strategy to build Global Primitives in the world coordinate system. This strategy associates multiple frames with non-overlapping regions and formulates a multi-frame reprojection error optimization, significantly improving tracking accuracy in texture-scarce scenarios. Evaluations on various datasets show that our system outperforms state-of-the-art methods in trajectory precision, particularly in challenging environments.</p></details> |  |

Owing to their original use-case, such systems often only contain a single camera facing into either direction and very limited overlap between fields of view. Our novelty consist of three optimization modules targeting at practical online calibration of exterior orientations from simple two-view geometry, reliable front-end initialization of relative displacements, and accurate back-end optimization using a continuous-time trajectory model. The commonality between the proposed modules is given by the fact that all three of them exploit motion priors that are related to the inherent non-holonomic characteristics of passenger vehicle motion. In contrast to prior related art, the proposed modules furthermore excel in terms of bypassing partial unobservabilities in the transformation variables that commonly occur for Ackermann-motion. As a further contribution, the modules are built into a novel surround-view camera SLAM system that specifically targets deployment on Ackermann vehicles operating in urban environments. All modules are studied in the context of in-depth ablation studies, and the practical validity of the entire framework is supported by a successful application to challenging, large-scale publicly available online datasets. Note that upon acceptance, the entire framework is scheduled for open-source release as part of an extension of the OpenGV library.</p></details> |  |
| **[Monocular visual simultaneous localization and mapping: (r)evolution from geometry to deep learning-based pipelines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02955v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rise of deep learning, there is a fundamental change in visual SLAM algorithms toward developing different modules trained as end-to-end pipelines. However, regardless of the implementation domain, visual SLAM's performance is subject to diverse environmental challenges, such as dynamic elements in outdoor environments, harsh imaging conditions in underwater environments, or blurriness in high-speed setups. These environmental challenges need to be identified to study the real-world viability of SLAM implementations. Motivated by the aforementioned challenges, this paper surveys the current state of visual SLAM algorithms according to the two main frameworks: geometry-based and learning-based SLAM. First, we introduce a general formulation of the SLAM pipeline that includes most of the implementations in the literature. Second, those implementations are classified and surveyed for geometry and learning-based SLAM. After that, environment-specific challenges are formulated to enable experimental evaluation of the resilience of different visual SLAM classes to varying imaging conditions. We address two significant issues in surveying visual SLAM, providing (1) a consistent classification of visual SLAM pipelines and (2) a robust evaluation of their performance under different deployment conditions. Finally, we give our take on future opportunities for visual SLAM implementations.</p></details> |  |

While incorporating semantic scene knowledge aids in building richer maps with contextual associations among mapped objects, representing them in structured formats like scene graphs has not been widely addressed, encountering complex map comprehension and limited scalability. This paper introduces visual S-Graphs (vS-Graphs), a novel real-time VSLAM framework that integrates vision-based scene understanding with map reconstruction and comprehensible graph-based representation. The framework infers structural elements (i.e., rooms and corridors) from detected building components (i.e., walls and ground surfaces) and incorporates them into optimizable 3D scene graphs. This solution enhances the reconstructed map's semantic richness, comprehensibility, and localization accuracy. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks and real-world datasets demonstrate that vS-Graphs outperforms state-of-the-art VSLAM methods, reducing trajectory error by an average of 3.38% and up to 9.58% on real-world data. Furthermore, the proposed framework achieves environment-driven semantic entity detection accuracy comparable to precise LiDAR-based frameworks using only visual features.

Under the hood, however, DUSt3R processes image pairs, regressing local 3D reconstructions that need to be aligned in a global coordinate system. The number of pairs, growing quadratically, is an inherent limitation that becomes especially concerning for robust and fast optimization in the case of large image collections. In this paper, we propose an extension of DUSt3R from pairs to multiple views, that addresses all aforementioned concerns. Indeed, we propose a Multi-view Network for Stereo 3D Reconstruction, or MUSt3R, that modifies the DUSt3R architecture by making it symmetric and extending it to directly predict 3D structure for all views in a common coordinate frame. Second, we entail the model with a multi-layer memory mechanism which allows to reduce the computational complexity and to scale the reconstruction to large collections, inferring thousands of 3D pointmaps at high frame-rates with limited added complexity. The framework is designed to perform 3D reconstruction both offline and online, and hence can be seamlessly applied to SfM and visual SLAM scenarios showing state-of-the-art performance on various 3D downstream tasks, including uncalibrated Visual Odometry, relative camera pose, scale and focal estimation, 3D reconstruction and multi-view depth estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2025</p></details> |

While planning with multiple robots, each robot maintains a belief over the state of the environment and reasons how the belief would evolve in the future for different possible actions. However, existing MR-BSP works have a common assumption that the beliefs of different robots are same at planning time. Such an assumption is often unrealistic as it requires prohibitively extensive and frequent data sharing capabilities. In practice, robots may have limited communication capabilities, and consequently beliefs of the robots can be different. Crucially, when the robots have inconsistent beliefs, the existing approaches could result in lack of coordination between the robots and may lead to unsafe decisions. In this paper, we present decentralized MR-BSP algorithms, with performance guarantees, for tackling this crucial gap. Our algorithms leverage the notion of action preferences. The base algorithm VerifyAC guarantees a consistent joint action selection by the cooperative robots via a three-step verification. When the verification succeeds, VerifyAC finds a consistent joint action without triggering a communication; otherwise it triggers a communication. We design an extended algorithm R-VerifyAC for further reducing the number of communications, by relaxing the criteria of action consistency. Another extension R-VerifyAC-simp builds on verifying a partial set of observations and improves the computation time significantly. The theoretical performance guarantees are corroborated with simulation results in discrete setting. Furthermore, we formulate our approaches for continuous and high-dimensional state and observation spaces, and provide experimental results for active multi-robot visual SLAM with real robots.</p></details> | <details><summary>The n...</summary><p>The new version has been extended from the existing arxiv version of the paper in the following way: - The old (base) algorithm VerifyAC has been retained in the new version. - Added two new algorithms R-VerifyAC and R-VerifyAC-simp along with their performance guarantees. - A new formulation in continuous spaces have been added. - Experimental results for the new approaches have been added</p></details> |

In this study, we present a pipeline for the precise tool positioning of heavy-duty, long-reach (HDLR) manipulators using advanced machine vision. A camera is utilized in the so-called eye-in-hand configuration to estimate directly the poses of a tool and a target object of interest (OOI). Based on the pose error between the tool and the target, along with motion-based calibration between the camera and the robot, precise tool positioning can be reliably achieved using conventional robotic modeling and control methods prevalent in the industry. The proposed methodology comprises orientation and position alignment based on the visually estimated OOI poses, whereas camera-to-robot calibration is conducted based on motion utilizing visual SLAM. The methods seek to avert the inaccuracies resulting from rigid-body--based kinematics of structurally flexible HDLR manipulators via image-based algorithms. To train deep neural networks for OOI pose estimation, only synthetic data are utilized. The methods are validated in a real-world setting using an HDLR manipulator with a 5 m reach. The experimental results demonstrate that an image-based average tool positioning error of less than 2 mm along the non-depth axes is achieved, which facilitates a new way to increase the task flexibility and automation level of non-rigid HDLR manipulators.</p></details> |  |

However, thermal imaging faces challenges like low contrast, high noise, and limited large-scale annotated datasets, restricting the use of deep learning in outdoor scenarios. We present DarkSLAM, a noval deep learning-based monocular thermal SLAM system designed for large-scale localization and reconstruction in complex lighting conditions.Our approach incorporates the Efficient Channel Attention (ECA) mechanism in visual odometry and the Selective Kernel Attention (SKA) mechanism in depth estimation to enhance pose accuracy and mitigate thermal depth degradation. Additionally, the system includes thermal depth-based loop closure detection and pose optimization, ensuring robust performance in low-texture thermal scenes. Extensive outdoor experiments demonstrate that DarkSLAM significantly outperforms existing methods like SC-Sfm-Learner and Shin et al., delivering precise localization and 3D dense mapping even in challenging nighttime environments.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches encounter challenges, including sensitivity to artifacts and noise, suboptimal selection of training viewpoints, and the absence of global optimization. In this paper, we propose GSORB-SLAM, a dense SLAM framework that integrates 3DGS with ORB features through a tightly coupled optimization pipeline. To mitigate the effects of noise and artifacts, we propose a novel geometric representation and optimization method for tracking, which significantly enhances localization accuracy and robustness. For high-fidelity mapping, we develop an adaptive Gaussian expansion and regularization method that facilitates compact yet expressive scene modeling while suppressing redundant primitives. Furthermore, we design a hybrid graph-based viewpoint selection mechanism that effectively reduces overfitting and accelerates convergence. Extensive evaluations across various datasets demonstrate that our system achieves state-of-the-art performance in both tracking precision-improving RMSE by 16.2% compared to ORB-SLAM2 baselines-and reconstruction quality-improving PSNR by 3.93 dB compared to 3DGS-SLAM baselines.

Despite the strong progress in this field, there are still challenging situations in which established methods fail. We present an approach to significantly improve the accuracy and reliability of established visual localization methods by adding rendered images. In detail, we first use a modern visual SLAM approach that provides a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) based map to create reference data. We demonstrate that enriching reference data with images rendered from 3DGS at randomly sampled poses significantly improves the performance of both geometry-based visual localization and Scene Coordinate Regression (SCR) methods. Through comprehensive evaluation in a large industrial environment, we analyze the performance impact of incorporating these additional rendered views.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a novel active illumination framework to enhance the performance of VO and V-SLAM algorithms in these challenging conditions. The developed approach dynamically controls a moving light source to illuminate highly textured areas, thereby improving feature extraction and tracking. Specifically, a detector block, which incorporates a deep learning-based enhancing network, identifies regions with relevant features. Then, a pan-tilt controller is responsible for guiding the light beam toward these areas, so that to provide information-rich images to the ego-motion estimation algorithm. Experimental results on a real robotic platform demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, showing a reduction in the pose estimation error up to 75% with respect to a traditional fixed lighting technique.</p></details> |  |

While extensive research has explored 3DGS for indoor trajectory tracking using visual sensor alone or in combination with Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), its integration with GNSS for large-scale outdoor navigation remains underexplored. To address these concerns, we proposed GS-GVINS: a tightly-integrated GNSS-Visual-Inertial Navigation System augmented by 3DGS. This system leverages 3D Gaussian as a continuous differentiable scene representation in largescale outdoor environments, enhancing navigation performance through the constructed 3D Gaussian map. Notably, GS-GVINS is the first GNSS-Visual-Inertial navigation application that directly utilizes the analytical jacobians of SE3 camera pose with respect to 3D Gaussians. To maintain the quality of 3DGS rendering in extreme dynamic states, we introduce a motionaware 3D Gaussian pruning mechanism, updating the map based on relative pose translation and the accumulated opacity along the camera ray. For validation, we test our system under different driving environments: open-sky, sub-urban, and urban. Both self-collected and public datasets are used for evaluation. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of GS-GVINS in enhancing navigation accuracy across diverse driving environments.</p></details> |  |

Our FLAF-based visual navigation is built upon a feature-based visual teach and repeat (VT\&R) framework, which supports many robotic applications by teaching a robot to navigate on various paths that cover a significant portion of daily autonomous navigation requirements. However, tracking failure in feature-based visual simultaneous localization and mapping (VSLAM) caused by textureless regions in human-made environments is still limiting VT\&R to be adopted in the real world. To address this problem, the proposed view planner is integrated into a feature-based visual SLAM system to build up an active VT\&R system that avoids tracking failure. In our system, a pan-tilt unit (PTU)-based active camera is mounted on the mobile robot. Using FLAF, the active camera-based VSLAM operates during the teaching phase to construct a complete path map and in the repeat phase to maintain stable localization. FLAF orients the robot toward more map points to avoid mapping failures during path learning and toward more feature-identifiable map points beneficial for localization while following the learned trajectory. Experiments in real scenarios demonstrate that FLAF outperforms the methods that do not consider feature-identifiability, and our active VT\&R system performs well in complex environments by effectively dealing with low-texture regions.</p></details> |  |
| **[PINGS: Gaussian Splatting Meets Distance Fields within a Point-Based Implicit Neural Map](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05752v1)** | 2025-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robots require high-fidelity reconstructions of their environment for effective operation. Such scene representations should be both, geometrically accurate and photorealistic to support downstream tasks. While this can be achieved by building distance fields from range sensors and radiance fields from cameras, the scalable incremental mapping of both fields consistently and at the same time with high quality remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel map representation that unifies a continuous signed distance field and a Gaussian splatting radiance field within an elastic and compact point-based implicit neural map. By enforcing geometric consistency between these fields, we achieve mutual improvements by exploiting both modalities. We devise a LiDAR-visual SLAM system called PINGS using the proposed map representation and evaluate it on several challenging large-scale datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that PINGS can incrementally build globally consistent distance and radiance fields encoded with a compact set of neural points. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, PINGS achieves superior photometric and geometric rendering at novel views by leveraging the constraints from the distance field. Furthermore, by utilizing dense photometric cues and multi-view consistency from the radiance field, PINGS produces more accurate distance fields, leading to improved odometry estimation and mesh reconstruction.</p></details> | 14 pages, 8 figures |

Traditional approaches require careful manual tuning and incur substantial computational overhead, while learning-based methods either lack explicit loop closure capabilities or implement them through computationally expensive methods. We present AutoLoop, a novel approach that combines automated curriculum learning with efficient fine-tuning for visual SLAM systems. Our method employs a DDPG (Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient) agent to dynamically adjust loop closure weights during training, eliminating the need for manual hyperparameter search while significantly reducing the required training steps. The approach pre-computes potential loop closure pairs offline and leverages them through an agent-guided curriculum, allowing the model to adapt efficiently to new scenarios. Experiments conducted on TartanAir for training and validated across multiple benchmarks including KITTI, EuRoC, ICL-NUIM and TUM RGB-D demonstrate that AutoLoop achieves comparable or superior performance while reducing training time by an order of magnitude compared to traditional approaches. AutoLoop provides a practical solution for rapid adaptation of visual SLAM systems, automating the weight tuning process that traditionally requires multiple manual iterations. Our results show that this automated curriculum strategy not only accelerates training but also maintains or improves the model's performance across diverse environmental conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Organizing Edge Computing Distribution Framework for Visual SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08629v1)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Localization within a known environment is a crucial capability for mobile robots. Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is a prominent solution to this problem. SLAM is a framework that consists of a diverse set of computational tasks ranging from real-time tracking to computation-intensive map optimization. This combination can present a challenge for resource-limited mobile robots. Previously, edge-assisted SLAM methods have demonstrated promising real-time execution capabilities by offloading heavy computations while performing real-time tracking onboard. However, the common approach of utilizing a client-server architecture for offloading is sensitive to server and network failures. In this article, we propose a novel edge-assisted SLAM framework capable of self-organizing fully distributed SLAM execution across a network of devices or functioning on a single device without connectivity. The architecture consists of three layers and is designed to be device-agnostic, resilient to network failures, and minimally invasive to the core SLAM system. We have implemented and demonstrated the framework for monocular ORB SLAM3 and evaluated it in both fully distributed and standalone SLAM configurations against the ORB SLAM3. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed design matches the accuracy and resource utilization of the monolithic approach while enabling collaborative execution.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

However, tracking loss can lead to the creation of disjoint submaps in multimap SLAM systems like ORB-SLAM3. Because of that, these systems employ submap merging strategies. As we show, these strategies are not always successful. In this paper, we investigate the impact of using modern VPR approaches for submap merging in visual SLAM. We argue that classical evaluation metrics are not sufficient to estimate the impact of a modern VPR component on the overall system. We show that naively replacing the VPR component does not leverage its full potential without requiring substantial interference in the original system. Because of that, we present a post-processing pipeline along with a set of metrics that allow us to estimate the impact of modern VPR components. We evaluate our approach on the NCLT and Newer College datasets using ORB-SLAM3 with NetVLAD and HDC-DELF as VPR components. Additionally, we present a simple approach for combining VPR with temporal consistency for map merging. We show that the map merging performance of ORB-SLAM3 can be improved. Building on these results, researchers in VPR can assess the potential of their approaches for SLAM systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at TAROS 2024.

| **[Drift-free Visual SLAM using Digital Twins](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08496v2)** | 2024-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Globally-consistent localization in urban environments is crucial for autonomous systems such as self-driving vehicles and drones, as well as assistive technologies for visually impaired people. Traditional Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) and Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (VSLAM) methods, though adequate for local pose estimation, suffer from drift in the long term due to reliance on local sensor data. While GPS counteracts this drift, it is unavailable indoors and often unreliable in urban areas. An alternative is to localize the camera to an existing 3D map using visual-feature matching. This can provide centimeter-level accurate localization but is limited by the visual similarities between the current view and the map. This paper introduces a novel approach that achieves accurate and globally-consistent localization by aligning the sparse 3D point cloud generated by the VIO/VSLAM system to a digital twin using point-to-plane matching; no visual data association is needed. The proposed method provides a 6-DoF global measurement tightly integrated into the VIO/VSLAM system. Experiments run on a high-fidelity GPS simulator and real-world data collected from a drone demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art VIO-GPS systems and offers superior robustness against viewpoint changes compared to the state-of-the-art Visual SLAM systems.</p></details> |  |

Most conventional structure from motion and monocular SLAM techniques assume input videos that feature predominantly static scenes with large amounts of parallax. Such methods tend to produce erroneous estimates in the absence of these conditions. Recent neural network-based approaches attempt to overcome these challenges; however, such methods are either computationally expensive or brittle when run on dynamic videos with uncontrolled camera motion or unknown field of view. We demonstrate the surprising effectiveness of a deep visual SLAM framework: with careful modifications to its training and inference schemes, this system can scale to real-world videos of complex dynamic scenes with unconstrained camera paths, including videos with little camera parallax. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real videos demonstrate that our system is significantly more accurate and robust at camera pose and depth estimation when compared with prior and concurrent work, with faster or comparable running times.

Ground-Truth-Free Tuning of Structure from Motion and Visual SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01116v1)** | 2024-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluation is critical to both developing and tuning Structure from Motion (SfM) and Visual SLAM (VSLAM) systems, but is universally reliant on high-quality geometric ground truth -- a resource that is not only costly and time-intensive but, in many cases, entirely unobtainable. This dependency on ground truth restricts SfM and SLAM applications across diverse environments and limits scalability to real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose a novel ground-truth-free (GTF) evaluation methodology that eliminates the need for geometric ground truth, instead using sensitivity estimation via sampling from both original and noisy versions of input images. Our approach shows strong correlation with traditional ground-truth-based benchmarks and supports GTF hyperparameter tuning. Removing the need for ground truth opens up new opportunities to leverage a much larger number of dataset sources, and for self-supervised and online tuning, with the potential for a data-driven breakthrough analogous to what has occurred in generative AI.</p></details> |  |

However, reconstructing thin structures of indoor scenes while ensuring real-time performance remains a challenge for dense visual SLAM systems. Previous methods do not consider varying quality of input RGB-D data and employ fixed-frequency mapping process to reconstruct the scene, which could result in the loss of valuable information in some frames. In this paper, we propose Uni-SLAM, a decoupled 3D spatial representation based on hash grids for indoor reconstruction. We introduce a novel defined predictive uncertainty to reweight the loss function, along with strategic local-to-global bundle adjustment. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our system achieves state-of-the-art tracking and mapping accuracy while maintaining real-time performance. It significantly improves over current methods with a 25% reduction in depth L1 error and a 66.86% completion rate within 1 cm on the Replica dataset, reflecting a more accurate reconstruction of thin structures.

We introduce a unique semantic feature loss that effectively compensates for the shortcomings of traditional depth and color losses in object optimization. Through a semantic-guided keyframe selection strategy, we prevent erroneous reconstructions caused by cumulative errors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SGS-SLAM delivers state-of-the-art performance in camera pose estimation, map reconstruction, precise semantic segmentation, and object-level geometric accuracy, while ensuring real-time rendering capabilities.</p></details> |  |

Notably, LiV-GS is the first method that directly aligns discrete and sparse LiDAR data with continuous differentiable Gaussian maps in large-scale outdoor scenes, overcoming the limitation of fixed resolution in traditional LiDAR mapping. The system aligns point clouds with Gaussian maps using shared covariance attributes for front-end tracking and integrates the normal orientation into the loss function to refines the Gaussian map. To reliably and stably update Gaussians outside the LiDAR field of view, we introduce a novel conditional Gaussian constraint that aligns these Gaussians closely with the nearest reliable ones. The targeted adjustment enables LiV-GS to achieve fast and accurate mapping with novel view synthesis at a rate of 7.98 FPS. Extensive comparative experiments demonstrate LiV-GS's superior performance in SLAM, image rendering and mapping. The successful cross-modal radar-LiDAR localization highlights the potential of LiV-GS for applications in cross-modal semantic positioning and object segmentation with Gaussian maps.</p></details> |  |

Recent advancements integrating Gaussian Splatting into SLAM systems have proven effective in creating high-quality renderings using explicit 3D Gaussian models, significantly improving environmental reconstruction fidelity. However, these approaches depend on a static environment assumption and face challenges in dynamic environments due to inconsistent observations of geometry and photometry. To address this problem, we propose DG-SLAM, the first robust dynamic visual SLAM system grounded in 3D Gaussians, which provides precise camera pose estimation alongside high-fidelity reconstructions. Specifically, we propose effective strategies, including motion mask generation, adaptive Gaussian point management, and a hybrid camera tracking algorithm to improve the accuracy and robustness of pose estimation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DG-SLAM delivers state-of-the-art performance in camera pose estimation, map reconstruction, and novel-view synthesis in dynamic scenes, outperforming existing methods meanwhile preserving real-time rendering ability.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods struggle with motion-blurred frames, which are common in real-world scenarios like low-light or long-exposure conditions. This often results in a significant reduction in both camera localization accuracy and map reconstruction quality. To address this challenge, we propose a dense visual SLAM pipeline (i.e. MBA-SLAM) to handle severe motion-blurred inputs. Our approach integrates an efficient motion blur-aware tracker with either neural radiance fields or Gaussian Splatting based mapper. By accurately modeling the physical image formation process of motion-blurred images, our method simultaneously learns 3D scene representation and estimates the cameras' local trajectory during exposure time, enabling proactive compensation for motion blur caused by camera movement. In our experiments, we demonstrate that MBA-SLAM surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods in both camera localization and map reconstruction, showcasing superior performance across a range of datasets, including synthetic and real datasets featuring sharp images as well as those affected by motion blur, highlighting the versatility and robustness of our approach.

However, these algorithms are application-specific and do not work across applications with different types of motion; even a tracking algorithm designed for a given application does not work in scenarios deviating from highly standard conditions. For example, a tracking algorithm designed for robot navigation inside a building will not work for tracking the same robot in an outdoor environment. To demonstrate this problem, we evaluate the performance of the state-of-the-art tracking methods across various applications and scenarios. To inform our analysis, we first categorize algorithmic, environmental, and locomotion-related challenges faced by tracking algorithms. We quantitatively evaluate the performance using multiple tracking algorithms and representative datasets for a wide range of Internet of Things (IoT) and Extended Reality (XR) applications, including autonomous vehicles, drones, and humans. Our analysis shows that no tracking algorithm works across different applications and scenarios within applications. Ultimately, using the insights generated from our analysis, we discuss multiple approaches to improving the tracking performance using input data characterization, leveraging intermediate information, and output evaluation.</p></details> |  |

However, generating these maps in complex environments, such as multi-level parking garages or shopping malls, remains a formidable challenge. In this paper, we introduce a participatory sensing approach that delegates map-building tasks to map users, thereby enabling cost-effective and continuous data collection. The proposed method harnesses the collective efforts of users, facilitating the expansion and ongoing update of the maps as the environment evolves. We realized this approach by developing Map++, an efficient system that functions as a plug-and-play extension, supporting participatory map-building based on existing SLAM algorithms. Map++ addresses a plethora of scalability issues in this participatory map-building system by proposing a set of lightweight, application-layer protocols. We evaluated Map++ in four representative settings: an indoor garage, an outdoor plaza, a public SLAM benchmark, and a simulated environment. The results demonstrate that Map++ can reduce traffic volume by approximately 46% with negligible degradation in mapping accuracy, i.e., less than 0.03m compared to the baseline system. It can support approximately $2 \times$ as many concurrent users as the baseline under the same network bandwidth. Additionally, for users who travel on already-mapped trajectories, they can directly utilize the existing maps for localization and save 47% of the CPU usage.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 15 figures.

While Monocular Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (MVSLAM) has emerged as a promising solution, its implementation in endoscopic procedures faces significant challenges due to hardware limitations, such as the use of a monocular camera and the absence of odometry sensors. This study presents BodySLAM, a robust deep learning-based MVSLAM approach that addresses these challenges through three key components: CycleVO, a novel unsupervised monocular pose estimation module; the integration of the state-of-the-art Zoe architecture for monocular depth estimation; and a 3D reconstruction module creating a coherent surgical map.

Results demonstrate that CycleVO exhibited competitive performance with the lowest inference time among pose estimation methods, while maintaining robust generalization capabilities, whereas Zoe significantly outperformed existing algorithms for depth estimation in endoscopy. BodySLAM's strong performance across diverse endoscopic scenarios demonstrates its potential as a viable MVSLAM solution for endoscopic applications.</p></details> | 16 pages, 7 figures |

In general, they heavily rely on global visual similarity matching. However, the ambiguous similarity interference in uncertain regions could often lead to excessive noise in correspondences, ultimately misleading SLAM in geometric modeling. To address this issue, we propose a Learnable Gaussian Uncertainty (LGU) matching. It mainly focuses on precise correspondence construction. In our scheme, a learnable 2D Gaussian uncertainty model is designed to associate matching-frame pairs. It could generate input-dependent Gaussian distributions for each correspondence map. Additionally, a multi-scale deformable correlation sampling strategy is devised to adaptively fine-tune the sampling of each direction by a priori look-up ranges, enabling reliable correlation construction. Furthermore, a KAN-bias GRU component is adopted to improve a temporal iterative enhancement for accomplishing sophisticated spatio-temporal modeling with limited parameters. The extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets are conducted to validate the effectiveness and superiority of our method.</p></details> |  |

The dataset comprises real-world indoor scenes with dynamic objects, motion blur, and varying illumination, as well as emulated camera failures, including lens dirt, condensation, underexposure, and overexposure. Additionally, we offer open-source scripts for injecting camera failures into any images, enabling further customization by the research community. Our experiments demonstrate that ORB-SLAM2, a traditional VSLAM algorithm, and TartanVO, a Deep Learning-based VO algorithm, can experience performance degradation under these challenging conditions. Therefore, this dataset and the camera failure open-source tools provide a valuable resource for developing more robust VSLAM systems capable of handling real-world challenges.</p></details> | 6 pages |

Of the various thermal comfort indicators, the mean radiant temperature (MRT) is very challenging to measure. Most common measurement methodologies are time-consuming and not user-friendly. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel MRT measurement framework that uses visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and semantic segmentation techniques. The proposed approach follows the rule of thumb of the traditional MRT calculation method using surface temperature and view factors. However, it employs visual SLAM and creates a 3D thermal point cloud with enriched surface temperature information. The framework then implements Grounded SAM, a new object detection and segmentation tool to extract features with distinct temperature profiles on building surfaces. The detailed segmentation of thermal features not only reduces potential errors in the calculation of the MRT but also provides an efficient reconstruction of the spatial MRT distribution in the indoor environment. We also validate the calculation results with the reference measurement methodology. This data-driven framework offers faster and more efficient MRT measurements and spatial mapping than conventional methods. It can enable the direct engagement of researchers and practitioners in MRT measurements and contribute to research on thermal comfort and radiant cooling and heating systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2024 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshop</p></details> |

To this end, one of the key challenges is cross-modal place recognition, which involves retrieving 3D scenes (point clouds) from a LiDAR map according to online RGB images. In this paper, we introduce an efficient framework to learn descriptors for both RGB images and point clouds. It takes visual state space model (VMamba) as the backbone and employs a pixel-view-scene joint training strategy for cross-modal contrastive learning. To address the field-of-view differences, independent descriptors are generated from multiple evenly distributed viewpoints for point clouds. A visible 3D points overlap strategy is then designed to quantify the similarity between point cloud views and RGB images for multi-view supervision. Additionally, when generating descriptors from pixel-level features using NetVLAD, we compensate for the loss of geometric information, and introduce an efficient scheme for multi-view generation. Experimental results on the KITTI and KITTI-360 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our method. The code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

It exhibits frame-processing rates above 60FPS on NVIDIA's low-powered 10W Jetson-NX embedded computer and above 200FPS on desktop-grade 200W GPUs, even in stereo configuration and in the multiscale setting. Our contributions are threefold: (i) a Bounded Rectification technique to prevent tagging many non-corner points as a corner in FAST detection, improving SLAM accuracy. (ii) A novel Pyramidal Culling and Aggregation (PyCA) technique that yields robust features while suppressing redundant ones at high speeds by harnessing a GPU device. PyCA uses our new Multi-Location Per Thread culling strategy (MLPT) and Thread-Efficient Warp-Allocation (TEWA) scheme for GPU to enable Jetson-SLAM achieving high accuracy and speed on embedded devices. (iii) Jetson-SLAM library achieves resource efficiency by having a data-sharing mechanism. Our experiments on three challenging datasets: KITTI, EuRoC, and KAIST-VIO, and two highly accurate SLAM backends: Full-BA and ICE-BA show that Jetson-SLAM is the fastest available accurate and GPU-accelerated SLAM system (Fig. 1).</p></details> |  |
| **[Compact 3D Gaussian Splatting For Dense Visual SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11247v2)** | 2024-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work has shown that 3D Gaussian-based SLAM enables high-quality reconstruction, accurate pose estimation, and real-time rendering of scenes. However, these approaches are built on a tremendous number of redundant 3D Gaussian ellipsoids, leading to high memory and storage costs, and slow training speed. To address the limitation, we propose a compact 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM system that reduces the number and the parameter size of Gaussian ellipsoids. A sliding window-based masking strategy is first proposed to reduce the redundant ellipsoids. Then we observe that the covariance matrix (geometry) of most 3D Gaussian ellipsoids are extremely similar, which motivates a novel geometry codebook to compress 3D Gaussian geometric attributes, i.e., the parameters. Robust and accurate pose estimation is achieved by a global bundle adjustment method with reprojection loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves faster training and rendering speed while maintaining the state-of-the-art (SOTA) quality of the scene representation.</p></details> |  |

Photometric calibration helps normalize pixel intensity values under different lighting conditions, and thereby improves the direct component of our H-SLAM. A tangential benefit also results to the indirect component of H-SLAM given that the detected features are more stable across variable lighting conditions. Our proposed photometrically calibrated H-SLAM is tested on several datasets, including the TUM monoVO as well as on a dataset we created. Calibrated H-SLAM outperforms other state of the art direct, indirect, and hybrid Visual SLAM systems in all the experiments. Furthermore, in online SLAM tested at our site, it also significantly outperformed the other SLAM Systems.</p></details> |  |

While learning-based methods have surpassed traditional handcrafted techniques, their training often relies on simplistic homography-based simulations of multi-view perspectives, limiting model generalisability. This paper presents a novel approach leveraging Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) to generate a diverse and realistic dataset consisting of indoor and outdoor scenes. Our proposed methodology adapts state-of-the-art feature detectors and descriptors for training on multi-view NeRF-synthesised data, with supervision achieved through perspective projective geometry. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed methodology achieves competitive or superior performance on standard benchmarks for relative pose estimation, point cloud registration, and homography estimation while requiring significantly less training data and time compared to existing approaches.</p></details> |  |

| **[Addressing the challenges of loop detection in agricultural environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15761v2)** | 2024-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While visual SLAM systems are well studied and achieve impressive results in indoor and urban settings, natural, outdoor and open-field environments are much less explored and still present relevant research challenges. Visual navigation and local mapping have shown a relatively good performance in open-field environments. However, globally consistent mapping and long-term localization still depend on the robustness of loop detection and closure, for which the literature is scarce. In this work we propose a novel method to pave the way towards robust loop detection in open fields, particularly in agricultural settings, based on local feature search and stereo geometric refinement, with a final stage of relative pose estimation. Our method consistently achieves good loop detections, with a median error of 15cm. We aim to characterize open fields as a novel environment for loop detection, understanding the limitations and problems that arise when dealing with them.</p></details> |  |

The method consists of two steps: visual perception and path planning. The visual perception part uses ORBSLAM3 enhanced with optical flow to estimate the car's poses and extract rich texture information from the scene. In the path planning phase, we employ a method combining a control Lyapunov function and control barrier function in the form of quadratic program (CLF-CBF-QP) together with an obstacle shape reconstruction process (SRP) to plan safe and stable trajectories. To validate the performance and robustness of the proposed method, simulation experiments were conducted with a car in various complex indoor environments using the Gazebo simulation environment. Our method can effectively avoid obstacles in the scenes. The proposed algorithm outperforms benchmark algorithms in achieving more stable and shorter trajectories across multiple simulated scenes.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages; Submitted to a journal</p></details> |
| **[Visual SLAM with 3D Gaussian Primitives and Depth Priors Enabling Novel View Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05635v2)** | 2024-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional geometry-based SLAM systems lack dense 3D reconstruction capabilities since their data association usually relies on feature correspondences. Additionally, learning-based SLAM systems often fall short in terms of real-time performance and accuracy. Balancing real-time performance with dense 3D reconstruction capabilities is a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a real-time RGB-D SLAM system that incorporates a novel view synthesis technique, 3D Gaussian Splatting, for 3D scene representation and pose estimation. This technique leverages the real-time rendering performance of 3D Gaussian Splatting with rasterization and allows for differentiable optimization in real time through CUDA implementation. We also enable mesh reconstruction from 3D Gaussians for explicit dense 3D reconstruction. To estimate accurate camera poses, we utilize a rotation-translation decoupled strategy with inverse optimization. This involves iteratively updating both in several iterations through gradient-based optimization. This process includes differentiably rendering RGB, depth, and silhouette maps and updating the camera parameters to minimize a combined loss of photometric loss, depth geometry loss, and visibility loss, given the existing 3D Gaussian map. However, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) struggles to accurately represent surfaces due to the multi-view inconsistency of 3D Gaussians, which can lead to reduced accuracy in both camera pose estimation and scene reconstruction. To address this, we utilize depth priors as additional regularization to enforce geometric constraints, thereby improving the accuracy of both pose estimation and 3D reconstruction. We also provide extensive experimental results on public benchmark datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods in terms of pose accuracy, geometric accuracy, and rendering performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[DynaPix SLAM: A Pixel-Based Dynamic Visual SLAM Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09879v2)** | 2024-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (V-SLAM) methods achieve remarkable performance in static environments, but face challenges in dynamic scenes where moving objects severely affect their core modules. To avoid this, dynamic V-SLAM approaches often leverage semantic information, geometric constraints, or optical flow. However, these methods are limited by imprecise estimations and their reliance on the accuracy of deep-learning models. Moreover, predefined thresholds for static/dynamic classification, the a-priori selection of dynamic object classes, and the inability to recognize unknown or unexpected moving objects, often degrade their performance. To address these limitations, we introduce DynaPix, a novel semantic-free V-SLAM system based on per-pixel motion probability estimation and an improved pose optimization process. The per-pixel motion probability is estimated using a static background differencing method on image data and optical flows computed on splatted frames. With DynaPix, we fully integrate these probabilities into map point selection and apply them through weighted bundle adjustment within the tracking and optimization modules of ORB-SLAM2. We thoroughly evaluate our method using the GRADE and TUM RGB-D datasets, showing significantly lower trajectory errors and longer tracking times in both static and dynamic sequences. The source code, datasets, and results are available at https://dynapix.is.tue.mpg.de/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Cheng...</summary><p>Chenghao Xu and Elia Bonetto contributed equally to this work as first authors. 19 pages, 4 tables, 6 figures.

| **[Advancements in Translation Accuracy for Stereo Visual-Inertial Initialization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15082v4)** | 2024-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the current initialization method in the state-of-the-art Stereo Visual-Inertial SLAM framework, ORB-SLAM3 has limitations. Its success depends on the performance of the pure stereo SLAM system and is based on the underlying assumption that pure visual SLAM can accurately estimate the camera trajectory, which is essential for inertial parameter estimation. Meanwhile, the further improved initialization method for ORB-SLAM3, known as Stereo-NEC, is time-consuming due to applying keypoint tracking to estimate gyroscope bias with normal epipolar constraints. To address the limitations of previous methods, this paper proposes a method aimed at enhancing translation accuracy during the initialization stage. The fundamental concept of our method is to improve the translation estimate with a 3 Degree-of-Freedom (DoF) Bundle Adjustment (BA), independently, while the rotation estimate is fixed, instead of using ORB-SLAM3's 6-DoF BA. Additionally, the rotation estimate will be updated by considering IMU measurements and gyroscope bias, unlike ORB-SLAM3's rotation, which is directly obtained from stereo visual odometry and may yield inferior results when operating in challenging scenarios. We also conduct extensive evaluations on the public benchmark, the EuRoC dataset, demonstrating that our method excels in accuracy.</p></details> |  |

It determines the pose of a camera sensor by robustly associating the object detections in the current frame with 3D objects in a lightweight object-level map. Object graphs, considering semantic uncertainties, are constructed for both the incoming camera frame and the pre-built map. Objects are represented as graph nodes, and each node employs unique semantic descriptors based on our devised graph kernels. We extract a subgraph from the target map graph by identifying potential object associations for each object detection, then refine these associations and pose estimations using a RANSAC-inspired strategy. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate that our method achieves more accurate data association and significantly increases relocalization success rates compared to baseline methods. The implementation of our method is released at \url{https://github.com/yutongwangBIT/GOReloc}.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, accepted by IEEE RAL</p></details> |

Despite excellent accuracy, however, such approaches are often expensive to run or do not generalize well zero-shot. Their runtime can also fluctuate wildly while their frontend and backend fight for access to GPU resources. To address these problems, we introduce Deep Patch Visual (DPV) SLAM, a method for monocular visual SLAM on a single GPU. DPV-SLAM maintains a high minimum framerate and small memory overhead (5-7G) compared to existing deep SLAM systems. On real-world datasets, DPV-SLAM runs at 1x-4x real-time framerates. We achieve comparable accuracy to DROID-SLAM on EuRoC and TartanAir while running 2.5x faster using a fraction of the memory. DPV-SLAM is an extension to the DPVO visual odometry system; its code can be found in the same repository: https://github.com/princeton-vl/DPVO</p></details> |  |

This capability is crucial for mobile robots to have reliable navigation, build accurate maps, and have precise behaviors around human collaborators. This paper focuses on the development of robust short-term relocalization capabilities for mobile robots using a monocular camera system. A novel multimodal keyframe descriptor is introduced, that contains semantic information of objects detected in the environment and the spatial information of the camera. Using this descriptor, a new Keyframe-based Place Recognition (KPR) method is proposed that is formulated as a multi-stage keyframe filtering algorithm, leading to a new relocalization pipeline for MKVSLAM systems. The proposed approach is evaluated over several indoor GPS denied datasets and demonstrates accurate pose recovery, in comparison to a bag-of-words approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, Keywords: VSLAM, Localization, Semantics.

However, the presence of inaccuracies in these depth images can greatly hinder the effectiveness of these applications, resulting in sub-optimal results. Depth images produced by commercially available cameras frequently exhibit noise, which manifests as flickering pixels and erroneous patches. ML-based methods to rectify these images are unsuitable for edge devices that have very limited computational resources. Non-ML methods are much faster but have limited accuracy, especially for correcting errors that are a result of occlusion and camera movement. We propose a scheme called VoxDepth that is fast, accurate, and runs very well on edge devices. It relies on a host of novel techniques: 3D point cloud construction and fusion, and using it to create a template that can fix erroneous depth images. VoxDepth shows superior results on both synthetic and real-world datasets. We demonstrate a 31% improvement in quality as compared to state-of-the-art methods on real-world depth datasets, while maintaining a competitive framerate of 27 FPS (frames per second).</p></details> |  |

Casual video captures often suffer from motion blur and varying appearances, which degrade the final quality of coherent 3D visual representation. We propose integrating the physical imaging into the SLAM system, which employs linear HDR radiance maps to collect measurements. Specifically, individual frames aggregate images of multiple poses along the camera trajectory to explain prevalent motion blur in hand-held videos. Additionally, we accommodate per-frame appearance variation by dedicating explicit variables for image formation steps, namely white balance, exposure time, and camera response function. Through joint optimization of additional variables, the SLAM pipeline produces high-quality images with more accurate trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach can be incorporated into recent visual SLAM pipelines using various scene representations, such as neural radiance fields or Gaussian splatting.</p></details> | ECCV 2024 |

To this end, we propose a complementarity-aware deep learning approach for RGB-D-based material classification built on top of an object-oriented pipeline. The approach further integrates the ORB-SLAM2 method for 3D scene mapping with multiscale clustering of the detected material semantics in the point cloud map generated by the visual SLAM algorithm.

Addressing these challenges, our research introduces AVM-SLAM, a cutting-edge semantic visual SLAM architecture with multi-sensor fusion in a bird's eye view (BEV). This novel framework synergizes the capabilities of four fisheye cameras, wheel encoders, and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) to construct a robust SLAM system.

In our work, we employ dictionary factors for scene representation, encoding the geometry and appearance information of the scene as a combination of basis and coefficient factors. Compared to neural implicit dense visual SLAM methods that directly encode scene information as features, our method exhibits superior scene detail reconstruction capabilities and more efficient memory usage, while our model size is insensitive to the size of the scene map, making our method more suitable for large-scale scenes. Additionally, we employ feature integration rendering to accelerate color rendering speed while ensuring color rendering quality, further enhancing the real-time performance of our neural SLAM method. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method is competitive with existing state-of-the-art neural implicit SLAM methods in terms of real-time performance, localization accuracy, and scene reconstruction quality.

Although deep learning-based local features excel at capturing high-level information and perform well on matching benchmarks, they struggle with generalization in continuous motion scenes, adversely affecting loop detection accuracy. Our system employs a Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) strategy to optimize the training of keypoint extraction networks, enhancing their adaptability to diverse environments. Additionally, we introduce a coarse-to-fine feature tracking mechanism for learned keypoints. It begins with a direct method to approximate the relative pose between consecutive frames, followed by a feature matching method for refined pose estimation. To mitigate cumulative positioning errors, DK-SLAM incorporates a novel online learning module that utilizes binary features for loop closure detection. This module dynamically identifies loop nodes within a sequence, ensuring accurate and efficient localization. Experimental evaluations on publicly available datasets demonstrate that DK-SLAM outperforms leading traditional and learning based SLAM systems, such as ORB-SLAM3 and LIFT-SLAM. These results underscore the efficacy and robustness of our DK-SLAM in varied and challenging real-world environments.</p></details> | In submission |

A probabilistic interpretation of the SLAM task allows for incorporating prior knowledge and for operation under uncertainty. Contrary to the common practice of computing point estimates of the system states, we capture the full posterior density through approximate Bayesian inference. This dynamic learning task falls under state estimation, where the state-of-the-art is in sequential Monte Carlo methods that tackle the forward filtering problem. In this paper, we introduce a framework for probabilistic SLAM using particle smoothing that does not only incorporate observed data in current state estimates, but it also back-tracks the updated knowledge to correct for past drift and ambiguities in both the map and in the states. Our solution can efficiently handle both dense and sparse map representations by Rao-Blackwellization of conditionally linear and conditionally linearized models. We show through simulations and real-world experiments how the principles apply to radio (BLE/Wi-Fi), magnetic field, and visual SLAM. The proposed solution is general, efficient, and works well under confounding noise.</p></details> | 23 pages, 7 figures |

However, human colonoscopies pose formidable challenges like occlusions, blur, light changes, lack of texture, deformation, water jets or tool interaction, which result in very frequent tracking losses. ORB-SLAM3, the top performing multiple-map V-SLAM, is unable to recover from them by merging sub-maps or relocalizing the camera, due to the poor performance of its place recognition algorithm based on ORB features and DBoW2 bag-of-words. We present CudaSIFT-SLAM, the first V-SLAM system able to process complete human colonoscopies in real-time. To overcome the limitations of ORB-SLAM3, we use SIFT instead of ORB features and replace the DBoW2 direct index with the more computationally demanding brute-force matching, being able to successfully match images separated in time for relocation and map merging. Real-time performance is achieved thanks to CudaSIFT, a GPU implementation for SIFT extraction and brute-force matching. We benchmark our system in the C3VD phantom colon dataset, and in a full real colonoscopy from the Endomapper dataset, demonstrating the capabilities to merge sub-maps and relocate in them, obtaining significantly longer sub-maps. Our system successfully maps in real-time 88 % of the frames in the C3VD dataset. In a real screening colonoscopy, despite the much higher prevalence of occluded and blurred frames, the mapping coverage is 53 % in carefully explored areas and 38 % in the full sequence, a 70 % improvement over ORB-SLAM3.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 10 figures, 6 tables, under revision</p></details> |

However, how to make full use of visual information as well as better integrate with inertial measurement unit (IMU) in visual SLAM has potential research value. This paper proposes a novel deep SLAM network with dual visual factors. The basic idea is to integrate both photometric factor and re-projection factor into the end-to-end differentiable structure through multi-factor data association module.

Yet, the two problems have largely been approached independently, without much synergy. Most visual SLAM methods can only reconstruct camera trajectories and scene structures up to scale, while most HMR methods reconstruct human meshes in metric scale but fall short in reasoning with cameras and scenes. This work introduces Synergistic Camera and Human Reconstruction (SynCHMR) to marry the best of both worlds. Specifically, we design Human-aware Metric SLAM to reconstruct metric-scale camera poses and scene point clouds using camera-frame HMR as a strong prior, addressing depth, scale, and dynamic ambiguities. Conditioning on the dense scene recovered, we further learn a Scene-aware SMPL Denoiser to enhance world-frame HMR by incorporating spatio-temporal coherency and dynamic scene constraints. Together, they lead to consistent reconstructions of camera trajectories, human meshes, and dense scene point clouds in a common world frame.

Utilizing the geometric information present in depth images, this method enables accurate removal of dynamic objects, thereby reducing the probability of camera drift. Additionally, we introduce a keyframe selection strategy for dynamic scenes, which enhances camera tracking robustness against large-scale objects and improves the efficiency of mapping. Experiments on publicly available RGB-D datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms competitive neural SLAM approaches in tracking accuracy and mapping quality in dynamic environments.</p></details> |  |

To help roboticists make cost-effective decisions, we present FogROS2-Config, an open toolkit that takes ROS2 nodes as input and automatically runs relevant benchmarks to quickly return a menu of cloud compute services that tradeoff latency and cost.

However, traditional manual feature-based methods in challenging lighting environments make it difficult to ensure robustness and accuracy. Some deep learning-based methods show potential but still have significant drawbacks. To address this problem, we propose a novel hybrid system for visual SLAM based on the LightGlue deep learning network. It uses deep local feature descriptors to replace traditional hand-crafted features and a more efficient and accurate deep network to achieve fast and precise feature matching. Thus, we use the robustness of deep learning to improve the whole system. We have combined traditional geometry-based approaches to introduce a complete visual SLAM system for monocular, binocular, and RGB-D sensors. We thoroughly tested the proposed system on four public datasets: KITTI, EuRoC, TUM, and 4Season, as well as on actual campus scenes. The experimental results show that the proposed method exhibits better accuracy and robustness in adapting to low-light and strongly light-varying environments than traditional manual features and deep learning-based methods. It can also run on GPU in real time.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a generic sparse visual SLAM framework capable of running on any number of cameras and in any arrangement. Our SLAM system uses the generalized camera model, which allows us to represent an arbitrary multi-camera system as a single imaging device. Additionally, it takes advantage of the overlapping fields of view (FoV) by extracting cross-matched features across cameras in the rig. This limits the linear rise in the number of features with the number of cameras and keeps the computational load in check while enabling an accurate representation of the scene. We evaluate our method in terms of accuracy, robustness, and run time on indoor and outdoor datasets that include challenging real-world scenarios such as narrow corridors, featureless spaces, and dynamic objects. We show that our system can adapt to different camera configurations and allows real-time execution for typical robotic applications. Finally, we benchmark the impact of the critical design parameters - the number of cameras and the overlap between their FoV that define the camera configuration for SLAM. All our software and datasets are freely available for further research.</p></details> |  |

This prevents efficient incorporation of loop closure constraints and limits scalability. To address these shortcomings, we propose a neural mapping framework which anchors lightweight neural fields to the pose graph of a sparse visual SLAM system. Our approach shows the ability to integrate large-scale loop closures, while limiting necessary reintegration. Furthermore, we verify the scalability of our approach by demonstrating successful building-scale mapping taking multiple loop closures into account during the optimization, and show that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches on large scenes in terms of quality and runtime.

The ones that deal with dynamic objects in the scenes usually rely on deep-learning-based methods to detect and filter these objects. However, these methods cannot deal with unknown moving objects. This work presents Panoptic-SLAM, an open-source visual SLAM system robust to dynamic environments, even in the presence of unknown objects. It uses panoptic segmentation to filter dynamic objects from the scene during the state estimation process. Panoptic-SLAM is based on ORB-SLAM3, a state-of-the-art SLAM system for static environments. The implementation was tested using real-world datasets and compared with several state-of-the-art systems from the literature, including DynaSLAM, DS-SLAM, SaD-SLAM, PVO and FusingPanoptic. For example, Panoptic-SLAM is on average four times more accurate than PVO, the most recent panoptic-based approach for visual SLAM. Also, experiments were performed using a quadruped robot with an RGB-D camera to test the applicability of our method in real-world scenarios. The tests were validated by a ground-truth created with a motion capture system.</p></details> |  |

Meanwhile, large scale applications aiming at the data collection in complex environments like factory halls or construction sites are becoming feasible. However, in contrast to small scale scenarios with building interiors separated to single rooms, shop floors or construction areas require measures at larger distances in potentially texture less areas under difficult illumination. Pose estimation is further aggravated since no GNSS measures are available as it is usual for such indoor applications. In our work, we realize data collection in a large factory hall by a robot system equipped with four stereo cameras as well as a 3D laser scanner. We apply our state-of-the-art LiDAR and visual SLAM approaches and discuss the respective pros and cons of the different sensor types for trajectory estimation and dense map generation in such an environment. Additionally, dense and accurate depth maps are generated by 3D Gaussian splatting, which we plan to use in the context of our project aiming on the automatic construction and site monitoring.</p></details> |  |

Our method, which runs live at 3fps, utilises Gaussians as the only 3D representation, unifying the required representation for accurate, efficient tracking, mapping, and high-quality rendering. Designed for challenging monocular settings, our approach is seamlessly extendable to RGB-D SLAM when an external depth sensor is available. Several innovations are required to continuously reconstruct 3D scenes with high fidelity from a live camera. First, to move beyond the original 3DGS algorithm, which requires accurate poses from an offline Structure from Motion (SfM) system, we formulate camera tracking for 3DGS using direct optimisation against the 3D Gaussians, and show that this enables fast and robust tracking with a wide basin of convergence. Second, by utilising the explicit nature of the Gaussians, we introduce geometric verification and regularisation to handle the ambiguities occurring in incremental 3D dense reconstruction. Finally, we introduce a full SLAM system which not only achieves state-of-the-art results in novel view synthesis and trajectory estimation but also reconstruction of tiny and even transparent objects.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR2...</summary><p>CVPR2024 Highlight.

When a pre-built 3D map is not available, the techniques of visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) are typically adopted. Due to error accumulation, visual SLAM (vSLAM) usually suffers from long-term drift. This paper proposes a framework to increase the localization accuracy by fusing the vSLAM with a deep-learning-based ground-to-satellite (G2S) image registration method. In this framework, a coarse (spatial correlation bound check) to fine (visual odometry consistency check) method is designed to select the valid G2S prediction. The selected prediction is then fused with the SLAM measurement by solving a scaled pose graph problem. To further increase the localization accuracy, we provide an iterative trajectory fusion pipeline. The proposed framework is evaluated on two well-known autonomous driving datasets, and the results demonstrate the accuracy and robustness in terms of vehicle localization.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 6 figures, to be published in 2024 International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)</p></details> |

It facilitates a better balance between efficiency and accuracy. Compared to recent SLAM methods employing neural implicit representations, our method utilizes a real-time differentiable splatting rendering pipeline that offers significant speedup to map optimization and RGB-D rendering. Specifically, we propose an adaptive expansion strategy that adds new or deletes noisy 3D Gaussians in order to efficiently reconstruct new observed scene geometry and improve the mapping of previously observed areas. This strategy is essential to extend 3D Gaussian representation to reconstruct the whole scene rather than synthesize a static object in existing methods. Moreover, in the pose tracking process, an effective coarse-to-fine technique is designed to select reliable 3D Gaussian representations to optimize camera pose, resulting in runtime reduction and robust estimation. Our method achieves competitive performance compared with existing state-of-the-art real-time methods on the Replica, TUM-RGBD datasets.

In this research, we present a significant extension and refinement of the state-of-the-art stereo SLAM system, known as ORB-SLAM2, with the objective of attaining even higher precision. To accomplish this objective, we commence by mapping measurements from all cameras onto a virtual camera termed BundledFrame. This virtual camera is meticulously engineered to seamlessly adapt to multi-camera configurations, facilitating the effective fusion of data captured from multiple cameras. Additionally, we harness extrinsic parameters in the bundle adjustment (BA) process to achieve precise trajectory estimation.Furthermore, we conduct an extensive analysis of the role of bundle adjustment (BA) in the context of multi-camera scenarios, delving into its impact on tracking, local mapping, and global optimization. Our experimental evaluation entails comprehensive comparisons between ground truth data and the state-of-the-art SLAM system. To rigorously assess the system's performance, we utilize the EuRoC datasets. The consistent results of our evaluations demonstrate the superior accuracy of our system in comparison to existing approaches.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods produce low-quality scene reconstruction and low-accuracy localization performance when scaling up to large indoor scenes and long sequences. These limitations are mainly due to their single, global radiance field with finite capacity, which does not adapt to large scenarios. Their end-to-end pose networks are also not robust enough with the growth of cumulative errors in large scenes. To this end, we introduce PLGSLAM, a neural visual SLAM system capable of high-fidelity surface reconstruction and robust camera tracking in real-time. To handle large-scale indoor scenes, PLGSLAM proposes a progressive scene representation method which dynamically allocates new local scene representation trained with frames within a local sliding window. This allows us to scale up to larger indoor scenes and improves robustness (even under pose drifts). In local scene representation, PLGSLAM utilizes tri-planes for local high-frequency features with multi-layer perceptron (MLP) networks for the low-frequency feature, achieving smoothness and scene completion in unobserved areas. Moreover, we propose local-to-global bundle adjustment method with a global keyframe database to address the increased pose drifts on long sequences. Experimental results demonstrate that PLGSLAM achieves state-of-the-art scene reconstruction results and tracking performance across various datasets and scenarios (both in small and large-scale indoor environments).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2024</p></details> |

In addition to challenging front-end data association, thermal imagery presents an additional difficulty for long term relocalization and map reuse. The relative temperatures of objects in thermal imagery change dramatically from day to night. Feature descriptors typically used for relocalization in SLAM are unable to maintain consistency over these diurnal changes. We show that learned feature descriptors can be used within existing Bag of Word based localization schemes to dramatically improve place recognition across large temporal gaps in thermal imagery. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of our trained vocabulary, we have developed a baseline SLAM system, integrating learned features and matching into a classical SLAM algorithm. Our system demonstrates good local tracking on challenging thermal imagery, and relocalization that overcomes dramatic day to night thermal appearance changes.

Ensuring that sensors are mounted in a manner that enables accurate detection, localization, and mapping is essential for the success of downstream control tasks. However, when designing a new robotic platform, researchers and practitioners alike usually mimic standard configurations or maximize simple heuristics like field-of-view (FOV) coverage to decide where to place exteroceptive sensors. In this work, we conduct an information-theoretic investigation of this overlooked element of robotic perception in the context of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). We show how to formalize the sensor arrangement problem as a form of subset selection under the E-optimality performance criterion. While this formulation is NP-hard in general, we show that a combination of greedy sensor selection and fast convex relaxation-based post-hoc verification enables the efficient recovery of certifiably optimal sensor designs in practice. Results from synthetic experiments reveal that sensors placed with OASIS outperform benchmarks in terms of mean squared error of visual SLAM estimates.</p></details> |  |

However, there are still some challenges: the limited scene representation capability of implicit encodings, the uncertainty in the rendering process from implicit representations, and the disruption of consistency by dynamic objects. To address these challenges, we propose a real-time dynamic visual SLAM system based on local-global fusion neural implicit representation, named DVN-SLAM. To improve the scene representation capability, we introduce a local-global fusion neural implicit representation that enables the construction of an implicit map while considering both global structure and local details. To tackle uncertainties arising from the rendering process, we design an information concentration loss for optimization, aiming to concentrate scene information on object surfaces. The proposed DVN-SLAM achieves competitive performance in localization and mapping across multiple datasets. More importantly, DVN-SLAM demonstrates robustness in dynamic scenes, a trait that sets it apart from other NeRF-based methods.</p></details> |  |

Unlike the current state-of-the-art method, which heavily relies on the accuracy of a pure visual SLAM system to estimate inertial variables without updating camera poses, potentially compromising accuracy and robustness, our approach offers a different solution. We realize the crucial impact of precise gyroscope bias estimation on rotation accuracy. This, in turn, affects trajectory accuracy due to the accumulation of translation errors. To address this, we first independently estimate the gyroscope bias and use it to formulate a maximum a posteriori problem for further refinement. After this refinement, we proceed to update the rotation estimation by performing IMU integration with gyroscope bias removed from gyroscope measurements. We then leverage robust and accurate rotation estimates to enhance translation estimation via 3-DoF bundle adjustment. Moreover, we introduce a novel approach for determining the success of the initialization by evaluating the residual of the normal epipolar constraint. Extensive evaluations on the EuRoC dataset illustrate that our method excels in accuracy and robustness. It outperforms ORB-SLAM3, the current leading stereo visual-inertial initialization method, in terms of absolute trajectory error and relative rotation error, while maintaining competitive computational speed. Notably, even with 5 keyframes for initialization, our method consistently surpasses the state-of-the-art approach using 10 keyframes in rotation accuracy.</p></details> |  |

It then grew to implement Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) on various robots and mobile platforms. As each application brings its own set of contraints on sensors, processing capabilities and locomotion, it raises the question of which SLAM approach is the most appropriate to use in terms of cost, accuracy, computation power and ease of integration. Since most of SLAM approaches are either visual or lidar-based, comparison is difficult. Therefore, we decided to extend RTAB-Map to support both visual and lidar SLAM, providing in one package a tool allowing users to implement and compare a variety of 3D and 2D solutions for a wide range of applications with different robots and sensors. This paper presents this extended version of RTAB-Map and its use in comparing, both quantitatively and qualitatively, a large selection of popular real-world datasets (e.g., KITTI, EuRoC, TUM RGB-D, MIT Stata Center on PR2 robot), outlining strengths and limitations of visual and lidar SLAM configurations from a practical perspective for autonomous navigation applications.</p></details> | 40 pages, 19 figures |

In this paper, we propose a joint multi-task network design for learning several tasks simultaneously. Our main motivation is the computational efficiency achieved by sharing the expensive initial convolutional layers between all tasks. Indeed, the main bottleneck in automated driving systems is the limited processing power available on deployment hardware. There is also some evidence for other benefits in improving accuracy for some tasks and easing development effort. It also offers scalability to add more tasks leveraging existing features and achieving better generalization. We survey various CNN based solutions for visual perception tasks in automated driving.

Some researchers have attempted to enhance localization accuracy by integrating the modeled object residuals into bundle adjustment. However, few have demonstrated better results than feature-based visual SLAM systems, as the generic coarse object models, such as cuboids or ellipsoids, are less accurate than feature points. In this paper, we propose a Visual Object Odometry and Mapping framework VOOM using high-level objects and low-level points as the hierarchical landmarks in a coarse-to-fine manner instead of directly using object residuals in bundle adjustment. Firstly, we introduce an improved observation model and a novel data association method for dual quadrics, employed to represent physical objects. It facilitates the creation of a 3D map that closely reflects reality. Next, we use object information to enhance the data association of feature points and consequently update the map. In the visual object odometry backend, the updated map is employed to further optimize the camera pose and the objects. Meanwhile, local bundle adjustment is performed utilizing the objects and points-based covisibility graphs in our visual object mapping process. Experiments show that VOOM outperforms both object-oriented SLAM and feature points SLAM systems such as ORB-SLAM2 in terms of localization. The implementation of our method is available at https://github.com/yutongwangBIT/VOOM.git.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables, conference icra 2024 accepted</p></details> |
| **[An Error-Matching Exclusion Method for Accelerating Visual SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14345v2)** | 2024-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Visual SLAM, achieving accurate feature matching consumes a significant amount of time, severely impacting the real-time performance of the system. This paper proposes an accelerated method for Visual SLAM by integrating GMS (Grid-based Motion Statistics) with RANSAC (Random Sample Consensus) for the removal of mismatched features. The approach first utilizes the GMS algorithm to estimate the quantity of matched pairs within the neighborhood and ranks the matches based on their confidence. Subsequently, the Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) algorithm is employed to further eliminate mismatched features. To address the time-consuming issue of randomly selecting all matched pairs, this method transforms it into the problem of prioritizing sample selection from high-confidence matches. This enables the iterative solution of the optimal model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a comparable accuracy to the original GMS-RANSAC while reducing the average runtime by 24.13% on the KITTI, TUM desk, and TUM doll datasets.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, based on a multi-level fine matching strategy, we propose a new feature matching method called KTGP-ORB. This method utilizes the similarity of local appearance in the Hamming space generated by feature descriptors to establish initial correspondences. It combines the constraint of local image motion smoothness, uses the GMS algorithm to enhance the accuracy of initial matches, and finally employs the PROSAC algorithm to optimize matches, achieving precise matching based on global grayscale information in Euclidean space. Experimental results demonstrate that the KTGP-ORB method reduces the error by an average of 29.92% compared to the ORB algorithm in complex scenes with illumination variations and blur.</p></details> |  |

As one such use case, drones in GPS-denied environments require equipping with different sensors (e.g., vision sensors) that provide reliable sensing results while performing pose estimation and localization. In this paper, reconstructing the maps of indoor environments alongside generating 3D scene graphs for a high-level representation using a camera mounted on a drone is targeted. Accordingly, an aerial robot equipped with a companion computer and an RGB-D camera was built and employed to be appropriately integrated with a Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (VSLAM) framework proposed by the authors. To enhance the situational awareness of the robot while reconstructing maps, various structural elements, including doors and walls, were labeled with printed fiducial markers, and a dictionary of the topological relations among them was fed to the system. The VSLAM system detects markers and reconstructs the map of the indoor areas enriched with higher-level semantic entities, including corridors and rooms. Another achievement is generating multi-layered vision-based situational graphs containing enhanced hierarchical representations of the indoor environment. In this regard, integrating VSLAM into the employed drone is the primary target of this paper to provide an end-to-end robot application for GPS-denied environments. To show the practicality of the system, various real-world condition experiments have been conducted in indoor scenarios with dissimilar structural layouts. Evaluations show the proposed drone application can perform adequately w.r.t. the ground-truth data and its baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Due to the improvement of CNN-based object detection algorithm, the robustness of visual relocalization is greatly enhanced especially in viewpoints where classical methods fail. However, ellipsoids (quadrics) generated by axis-aligned object detection may limit the accuracy of the object-level representation and degenerate the performance of visual relocalization system. In this paper, we propose a novel method of automatic object-level voxel modeling for accurate ellipsoidal representations of objects. As for visual relocalization, we design a better pose optimization strategy for camera pose recovery, to fully utilize the projection characteristics of 2D fitted ellipses and the 3D accurate ellipsoids. All of these modules are entirely intergrated into visual SLAM system. Experimental results show that our semantic object-level mapping and object-based visual relocalization methods significantly enhance the performance of visual relocalization in terms of robustness to new viewpoints.</p></details> |  |

However, current research faces challenges in accurately localizing and mapping in planar ambiguous scenes, primarily due to the poor accuracy of the employed planar features and data association methods. In this paper, we propose a visual SLAM system based on planar features designed for planar ambiguous scenes, encompassing planar processing, data association, and multi-constraint factor graph optimization. We introduce a planar processing strategy that integrates semantic information with planar features, extracting the edges and vertices of planes to be utilized in tasks such as plane selection, data association, and pose optimization. Next, we present an integrated data association strategy that combines plane parameters, semantic information, projection IoU (Intersection over Union), and non-parametric tests, achieving accurate and robust plane data association in planar ambiguous scenes. Finally, we design a set of multi-constraint factor graphs for camera pose optimization. Qualitative and quantitative experiments conducted on publicly available datasets demonstrate that our proposed system competes effectively in both accuracy and robustness in terms of map construction and camera localization compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional vSLAM systems are limited by the camera's narrow field-of-view, resulting in challenges such as sparse feature distribution and lack of dense depth information. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a 360ORB-SLAM system for panoramic images that combines with a depth completion network. The system extracts feature points from the panoramic image, utilizes a panoramic triangulation module to generate sparse depth information, and employs a depth completion network to obtain a dense panoramic depth map. Experimental results on our novel panoramic dataset constructed based on Carla demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior scale accuracy compared to existing monocular SLAM methods and effectively addresses the challenges of feature association and scale ambiguity. The integration of the depth completion network enhances system stability and mitigates the impact of dynamic elements on SLAM performance.</p></details> | 6 pages, 9 figures |

Addressing these challenges, this paper introduces a novel, tightly-coupled Acoustic-Visual-Inertial SLAM approach, termed AQUA-SLAM, to fuse a Doppler Velocity Log (DVL), a stereo camera, and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) within a graph optimization framework. Moreover, we propose an efficient sensor calibration technique, encompassing multi-sensor extrinsic calibration (among the DVL, camera and IMU) and DVL transducer misalignment calibration, with a fast linear approximation procedure for real-time online execution. The proposed methods are extensively evaluated in a tank environment with ground truth, and validated for offshore applications in the North Sea. The results demonstrate that our method surpasses current state-of-the-art underwater and visual-inertial SLAM systems in terms of localization accuracy and robustness. The proposed system will be made open-source for the community.</p></details> |  |

These environments pose significant challenges due to variable lighting, weather conditions, and complex terrain. Visual-Inertial SLAM has emerged as a promising solution for robust localization under such conditions. This paper benchmarks several open-source Visual-Inertial SLAM systems, including traditional methods (ORB-SLAM3, VINS-Fusion, OpenVINS, Kimera, and SVO Pro) and learning-based approaches (HFNet-SLAM, AirSLAM), to evaluate their performance in unstructured natural outdoor settings. We focus on the impact of loop closing on localization accuracy and computational demands, providing a comprehensive analysis of these systems' effectiveness in real-world environments and especially their application to embedded systems in outdoor robotics. Our contributions further include an assessment of varying frame rates on localization accuracy and computational load. The findings highlight the importance of loop closing in improving localization accuracy while managing computational resources efficiently, offering valuable insights for optimizing Visual-Inertial SLAM systems for practical outdoor applications in mobile robotics.

Hereby depth predictions from a deep neural network are fused in a fully probabilistic manner. Specifically, our method is rigorously uncertainty-aware: first, we use depth and uncertainty predictions from a deep network not only from the robot's stereo rig, but we further probabilistically fuse motion stereo that provides depth information across a range of baselines, therefore drastically increasing mapping accuracy. Next, predicted and fused depth uncertainty propagates not only into occupancy probabilities but also into alignment factors between generated dense submaps that enter the probabilistic nonlinear least squares estimator. This submap representation offers globally consistent geometry at scale. Our method is thoroughly evaluated in two benchmark datasets, resulting in localization and mapping accuracy that exceeds the state of the art, while simultaneously offering volumetric occupancy directly usable for downstream robotic planning and control in real-time.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables, accepted in ICRA 2025</p></details> |

Safe navigation is crucial for all robotics applications and requires accurate and consistent maps of the robot's surroundings. To achieve full autonomy and allow deployment in a wide variety of environments, the robot must rely on on-board state estimation which is prone to drift over time. We propose a Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV) exploration framework based on local submaps to allow retaining global consistency by applying loop-closure corrections to the relative submap poses. To enable large-scale exploration we efficiently compute global, environment-wide frontiers from the local submap frontiers and use a sampling-based next-best-view exploration planner. Our method seamlessly supports using either a LiDAR sensor or a depth camera, making it suitable for different kinds of MAV platforms. We perform comparative evaluations in simulation against a state-of-the-art submap-based exploration framework to showcase the efficiency and reconstruction quality of our approach. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of our method to real-world MAVs, one equipped with a LiDAR and the other with a depth camera.

Specifically, for line matching process, we propose a novel geometric line optical flow algorithm that efficiently tracks line features with varying lengths, whitch is do not require detections and descriptors in every frame. To address the instability of Manhattan estimation from line features, we propose a tracking-by-detection module that consistently tracks and optimizes Manhattan framse in consecutive images. By aligning the Manhattan World with the VIO world frame, the tracking could restart using the latest pose from back-end, simplifying the coordinate transformations within the system. Furthermore, we implement a mechanism to validate Manhattan frames and a novel global structural constraints back-end optimization. Extensive experiments results on vairous datasets, including benchmark and self-collected datasets, show that the proposed approach outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy and long-range robustness.

In this paper, we propose RUSSO, a robust underwater SLAM system which fuses stereo camera, inertial measurement unit (IMU), and imaging sonar to achieve robust and accurate localization in challenging underwater environments for 6 degrees of freedom (DoF) estimation. During visual degradation, the system is reduced to a sonar-inertial system estimating 3-DoF poses. The sonar pose estimation serves as a strong prior for IMU propagation, thereby enhancing the reliability of pose estimation with IMU propagation. Additionally, we propose a SLAM initialization method that leverages the imaging sonar to counteract the lack of visual features during the initialization stage of SLAM. We extensively validate RUSSO through experiments in simulator, pool, and sea scenarios. The results demonstrate that RUSSO achieves better robustness and localization accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art visual-inertial SLAM systems, especially in visually challenging scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time fusing stereo camera, IMU, and imaging sonar to realize robust underwater SLAM against visual degradation.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce LVI-GS, a tightly-coupled LiDAR-Visual-Inertial mapping framework with 3DGS, which leverages the complementary characteristics of LiDAR and image sensors to capture both geometric structures and visual details of 3D scenes. To this end, the 3D Gaussians are initialized from colourized LiDAR points and optimized using differentiable rendering. In order to achieve high-fidelity mapping, we introduce a pyramid-based training approach to effectively learn multi-level features and incorporate depth loss derived from LiDAR measurements to improve geometric feature perception. Through well-designed strategies for Gaussian-Map expansion, keyframe selection, thread management, and custom CUDA acceleration, our framework achieves real-time photo-realistic mapping. Numerical experiments are performed to evaluate the superior performance of our method compared to state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[SuperVINS: A Real-Time Visual-Inertial SLAM Framework for Challenging Imaging Conditions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21348v2)** | 2024-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The traditional visual-inertial SLAM system often struggles with stability under low-light or motion-blur conditions, leading to potential lost of trajectory tracking. High accuracy and robustness are essential for the long-term and stable localization capabilities of SLAM systems. Addressing the challenges of enhancing robustness and accuracy in visual-inertial SLAM, this paper propose SuperVINS, a real-time visual-inertial SLAM framework designed for challenging imaging conditions. In contrast to geometric modeling, deep learning features are capable of fully leveraging the implicit information present in images, which is often not captured by geometric features. Therefore, SuperVINS, developed as an enhancement of VINS-Fusion, integrates the deep learning neural network model SuperPoint for feature point extraction and loop closure detection. At the same time, a deep learning neural network LightGlue model for associating feature points is integrated in front-end feature matching. A feature matching enhancement strategy based on the RANSAC algorithm is proposed. The system is allowed to set different masks and RANSAC thresholds for various environments, thereby balancing computational cost and localization accuracy. Additionally, it allows for flexible training of specific SuperPoint bag of words tailored for loop closure detection in particular environments. The system enables real-time localization and mapping. Experimental validation on the well-known EuRoC dataset demonstrates that SuperVINS is comparable to other visual-inertial SLAM system in accuracy and robustness across the most challenging sequences. This paper analyzes the advantages of SuperVINS in terms of accuracy, real-time performance, and robustness. To facilitate knowledge exchange within the field, we have made the code for this paper publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Visual-Inertial SLAM as Simple as A, B, VINS](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05969v3)** | 2024-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present AB-VINS, a different kind of visual-inertial SLAM system. Unlike most popular VINS methods which only use hand-crafted techniques, AB-VINS makes use of three different deep neural networks. Instead of estimating sparse feature positions, AB-VINS only estimates the scale and bias parameters (a and b) of monocular depth maps, as well as other terms to correct the depth using multi-view information, which results in a compressed feature state. Despite being an optimization-based system, the front-end motion tracking thread of AB-VINS surpasses the efficiency of a state-of-the-art filtering-based method while also providing dense depth. When performing loop closures, standard keyframe-based SLAM systems need to relinearize a number of variables which is linear with respect to the number of keyframes. In contrast, the proposed AB-VINS can incorporate loop closures while only affecting a constant number of variables. This is thanks to a novel data structure called the memory tree, where keyframe poses are defined relative to each other rather than all in one global frame, allowing for all but a few states to be fixed. While AB-VINS might not be as accurate as state-of-the-art VINS algorithms, it is shown to be more robust.</p></details> | Submitted to T-RO |
| **[Enhancing Visual Inertial SLAM with Magnetic Measurements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09904v1)** | 2024-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents an extension to visual inertial odometry (VIO) by introducing tightly-coupled fusion of magnetometer measurements. A sliding window of keyframes is optimized by minimizing re-projection errors, relative inertial errors, and relative magnetometer orientation errors. The results of IMU orientation propagation are used to efficiently transform magnetometer measurements between frames producing relative orientation constraints between consecutive frames. The soft and hard iron effects are calibrated using an ellipsoid fitting algorithm. The introduction of magnetometer data results in significant reductions in the orientation error and also in recovery of the true yaw orientation with respect to the magnetic north. The proposed framework operates in all environments with slow-varying magnetic fields, mainly outdoors and underwater. We have focused our work on the underwater domain, especially in underwater caves, as the narrow passage and turbulent flow make it difficult to perform loop closures and reset the localization drift. The underwater caves present challenges to VIO due to the absence of ambient light and the confined nature of the environment, while also being a crucial source of fresh water and providing valuable historical records. Experimental results from underwater caves demonstrate the improvements in accuracy and robustness introduced by the proposed VIO extension.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advancements in Translation Accuracy for Stereo Visual-Inertial Initialization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15082v4)** | 2024-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the current initialization method in the state-of-the-art Stereo Visual-Inertial SLAM framework, ORB-SLAM3 has limitations. Its success depends on the performance of the pure stereo SLAM system and is based on the underlying assumption that pure visual SLAM can accurately estimate the camera trajectory, which is essential for inertial parameter estimation. Meanwhile, the further improved initialization method for ORB-SLAM3, known as Stereo-NEC, is time-consuming due to applying keypoint tracking to estimate gyroscope bias with normal epipolar constraints. To address the limitations of previous methods, this paper proposes a method aimed at enhancing translation accuracy during the initialization stage. The fundamental concept of our method is to improve the translation estimate with a 3 Degree-of-Freedom (DoF) Bundle Adjustment (BA), independently, while the rotation estimate is fixed, instead of using ORB-SLAM3's 6-DoF BA. Additionally, the rotation estimate will be updated by considering IMU measurements and gyroscope bias, unlike ORB-SLAM3's rotation, which is directly obtained from stereo visual odometry and may yield inferior results when operating in challenging scenarios. We also conduct extensive evaluations on the public benchmark, the EuRoC dataset, demonstrating that our method excels in accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Our framework fully exploits the benefits of wide field-of-view from multi-camera systems, and the metric scale measurements provided by an inertial measurement unit (IMU). We introduce an improved IMU pre-integration formulation based on the exponential function of an automorphism of SE_2(3), which can effectively enhance tracking performance under fast rotational motion and extended integration time. Furthermore, we extend conventional front-end tracking and back-end optimization module designed for monocular or stereo setup towards multi-camera systems, and introduce implementation details that contribute to the performance of our system in challenging scenarios. The practical validity of our approach is supported by our experiments on public datasets.

| **[IDLS: Inverse Depth Line based Visual-Inertial SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11748v2)** | 2024-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For robust visual-inertial SLAM in perceptually-challenging indoor environments,recent studies exploit line features to extract descriptive information about scene structure to deal with the degeneracy of point features. But existing point-line-based SLAM methods mainly use Pl\"ucker matrix or orthogonal representation to represent a line, which needs to calculate at least four variables to determine a line. Given the numerous line features to determine in each frame, the overly flexible line representation increases the computation burden and comprises the accuracy of the results. In this paper, we propose inverse depth representation for a line, which models each extracted line feature using only two variables, i.e., the inverse depths of the two ending points. It exploits the fact that the projected line's pixel coordinates on the image plane are rather accurate, which partially restrict the line. Using this compact line presentation, Inverse Depth Line SLAM (IDLS) is proposed to track the line features in SLAM in an accurate and efficient way. A robust line triangulation method and a novel line re-projection error model are introduced. And a two-step optimization method is proposed to firstly determine the lines and then to estimate the camera poses in each frame. IDLS is extensively evaluated in multiple perceptually-challenging datasets. The results show it is more accurate, robust, and needs lower computational overhead than the current state-of-the-art of point-line-based SLAM methods.</p></details> |  |

However, how to make full use of visual information as well as better integrate with inertial measurement unit (IMU) in visual SLAM has potential research value. This paper proposes a novel deep SLAM network with dual visual factors. The basic idea is to integrate both photometric factor and re-projection factor into the end-to-end differentiable structure through multi-factor data association module. We show that the proposed network dynamically learns and adjusts the confidence maps of both visual factors and it can be further extended to include the IMU factors as well. Extensive experiments validate that our proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on several public datasets, including TartanAir, EuRoC and ETH3D-SLAM. Specifically, when dynamically fusing the three factors together, the absolute trajectory error for both monocular and stereo configurations on EuRoC dataset has reduced by 45.3% and 36.2% respectively.</p></details> | Accepted to ICRA2024 |

Despite their advancements, these methods often encounter dead-reckoning errors that leads to considerable drift in estimated platform motion especially during long traverses. In such cases, the drift error is not negligible and should be rectified. Our proposed approach minimizes the drift error by correcting the estimated motion generated by any SLAM method at each epoch. Our methodology treats positioning measurements rendered by the SLAM solution as random variables formulated jointly in a multivariate distribution. In this setting, The correction of the drift becomes equivalent to finding the mode of this multivariate distribution which jointly maximizes the likelihood of a set of relevant geo-spatial priors about the platform motion and environment. Our method is integrable into any SLAM/VIO method as an correction module. Our experimental results shows the effectiveness of our approach in minimizing the drift error by 10x in long treverses.</p></details> |  |

The main limitation is the difficulty of obtaining accurate maps at high temporal and spatial resolution as a basis for informed forestry decision-making, due to the vast area forests extend over and the sheer number of trees. To address this challenge, we present an autonomous Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV) system which purely relies on cost-effective and light-weight passive visual and inertial sensors to perform under-canopy autonomous navigation. We leverage visual-inertial simultaneous localization and mapping (VI-SLAM) for accurate MAV state estimates and couple it with a volumetric occupancy submapping system to achieve a scalable mapping framework which can be directly used for path planning. As opposed to a monolithic map, submaps inherently deal with inevitable drift and corrections from VI-SLAM, since they move with pose estimates as they are updated. To ensure the safety of the MAV during navigation, we also propose a novel reference trajectory anchoring scheme that moves and deforms the reference trajectory the MAV is tracking upon state updates from the VI-SLAM system in a consistent way, even upon large changes in state estimates due to loop-closures. We thoroughly validate our system in both real and simulated forest environments with high tree densities in excess of 400 trees per hectare and at speeds up to 3 m/s - while not encountering a single collision or system failure. To the best of our knowledge this is the first system which achieves this level of performance in such unstructured environment using low-cost passive visual sensors and fully on-board computation including VI-SLAM.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |

Unlike the current state-of-the-art method, which heavily relies on the accuracy of a pure visual SLAM system to estimate inertial variables without updating camera poses, potentially compromising accuracy and robustness, our approach offers a different solution. We realize the crucial impact of precise gyroscope bias estimation on rotation accuracy. This, in turn, affects trajectory accuracy due to the accumulation of translation errors. To address this, we first independently estimate the gyroscope bias and use it to formulate a maximum a posteriori problem for further refinement. After this refinement, we proceed to update the rotation estimation by performing IMU integration with gyroscope bias removed from gyroscope measurements. We then leverage robust and accurate rotation estimates to enhance translation estimation via 3-DoF bundle adjustment. Moreover, we introduce a novel approach for determining the success of the initialization by evaluating the residual of the normal epipolar constraint. Extensive evaluations on the EuRoC dataset illustrate that our method excels in accuracy and robustness. It outperforms ORB-SLAM3, the current leading stereo visual-inertial initialization method, in terms of absolute trajectory error and relative rotation error, while maintaining competitive computational speed. Notably, even with 5 keyframes for initialization, our method consistently surpasses the state-of-the-art approach using 10 keyframes in rotation accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Our system relies solely on onboard IMU measurements, stereo infrared images, and depth images and autonomously corrects teleoperated inputs when they are deemed unsafe. We define a point in 3D space as unsafe if it satisfies either of two conditions: (i) it is occupied by an obstacle, or (ii) it remains unmapped. At each time step, an occupancy map of the environment is updated by the VI-SLAM by fusing the onboard measurements, and a CBF is constructed to parameterize the (un)safe region in the 3D space. Given the CBF and state feedback from the VI-SLAM module, a safety filter computes a certified reference that best matches the teleoperation input while satisfying the safety constraint encoded by the CBF. In contrast to existing perception-based safe control frameworks, we directly close the perception-action loop and demonstrate the full capability of safe control in combination with real-time VI-SLAM without any external infrastructure or prior knowledge of the environment. We verify the efficacy of the perceptive safety filter in real-time MAV experiments using exclusively onboard sensing and computation and show that the teleoperated MAV is able to safely navigate through unknown environments despite arbitrary inputs sent by the teleoperator.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) 2024, 7 pages, 7 figures, supplementary video is available at https://youtu.be/rCxbWY4PIfQ?si=DC-9mg7g1WooNdaV</p></details> |

A novel and correspondence-free, inherently probabilistic, formulation of LiDAR residuals is introduced, expressed only in terms of the occupancy fields and its respective gradients. These residuals can be added to a factor graph optimisation problem, either as frame-to-map factors for the live estimates or as map-to-map factors aligning the submaps with respect to one another. Experimental validation demonstrates that the approach achieves state-of-the-art pose accuracy and furthermore produces globally consistent volumetric occupancy submaps which can be directly used in downstream tasks such as navigation or exploration.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) 2024</p></details> |

These new features are evaluated extensively on a variety of simulated and real robotic platforms, including drones, quadrupeds, wheeled robots, and simulated self-driving cars. We present comparisons against several state-of-the-art visual-inertial SLAM pipelines and discuss strengths and weaknesses of the new release of Kimera.

In this paper, we build on Kimera and extend it to use multiple cameras as well as external (eg wheel) odometry sensors, to obtain accurate and robust odometry estimates in real-world problems. Additionally, we propose an effective scheme for closing loops that circumvents the drawbacks of common alternatives based on the Perspective-n-Point method and also works with a single monocular camera. Finally, we develop a method for dense 3D mapping of the free space that combines a segmentation network for free-space detection with a homography-based dense mapping technique. We test our system on photo-realistic simulations and on several real datasets collected on a car prototype developed by the Ford Motor Company, spanning both indoor and outdoor parking scenarios. Our multi-camera system is shown to outperform state-of-the art open-source visual-inertial-SLAM pipelines (Vins-Fusion, ORB-SLAM3), and exhibits an average trajectory error under 1% of the trajectory length across more than 8km of distance traveled (combined across all datasets).

The fusion of camera and inertial measurement unit (IMU) makes up for the shortcomings of a signal sensor, which significantly improves the accuracy and robustness of localization in challenging environments. This article presents PLE-SLAM, an accurate and real-time visual-inertial SLAM algorithm based on point-line features and efficient IMU initialization. First, we use parallel computing methods to extract features and compute descriptors to ensure real-time performance. Adjacent short line segments are merged into long line segments, and isolated short line segments are directly deleted. Second, a rotation-translation-decoupled initialization method is extended to use both points and lines. Gyroscope bias is optimized by tightly coupling IMU measurements and image observations. Accelerometer bias and gravity direction are solved by an analytical method for efficiency. To improve the system's intelligence in handling complex environments, a scheme of leveraging semantic information and geometric constraints to eliminate dynamic features and A solution for loop detection and closed-loop frame pose estimation using CNN and GNN are integrated into the system. All networks are accelerated to ensure real-time performance. The experiment results on public datasets illustrate that PLE-SLAM is one of the state-of-the-art visual-inertial SLAM systems.</p></details> |  |

| **[LF-VISLAM: A SLAM Framework for Large Field-of-View Cameras with Negative Imaging Plane on Mobile Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05167v3)** | 2023-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) has become a crucial aspect in the fields of autonomous driving and robotics. One crucial component of visual SLAM is the Field-of-View (FoV) of the camera, as a larger FoV allows for a wider range of surrounding elements and features to be perceived. However, when the FoV of the camera reaches the negative half-plane, traditional methods for representing image feature points using [u,v,1]^T become ineffective. While the panoramic FoV is advantageous for loop closure, its benefits are not easily realized under large-attitude-angle differences where loop-closure frames cannot be easily matched by existing methods. As loop closure on wide-FoV panoramic data further comes with a large number of outliers, traditional outlier rejection methods are not directly applicable. To address these issues, we propose LF-VISLAM, a Visual Inertial SLAM framework for cameras with extremely Large FoV with loop closure. A three-dimensional vector with unit length is introduced to effectively represent feature points even on the negative half-plane. The attitude information of the SLAM system is leveraged to guide the feature point detection of the loop closure. Additionally, a new outlier rejection method based on the unit length representation is integrated into the loop closure module. We collect the PALVIO dataset using a Panoramic Annular Lens (PAL) system with an entire FoV of 360{\deg}x(40{\deg}~120{\deg}) and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) for Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO) to address the lack of panoramic SLAM datasets. Experiments on the established PALVIO and public datasets show that the proposed LF-VISLAM outperforms state-of-the-art SLAM methods.

| **[EDI: ESKF-based Disjoint Initialization for Visual-Inertial SLAM Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02670v1)** | 2023-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual-inertial initialization can be classified into joint and disjoint approaches. Joint approaches tackle both the visual and the inertial parameters together by aligning observations from feature-bearing points based on IMU integration then use a closed-form solution with visual and acceleration observations to find initial velocity and gravity. In contrast, disjoint approaches independently solve the Structure from Motion (SFM) problem and determine inertial parameters from up-to-scale camera poses obtained from pure monocular SLAM. However, previous disjoint methods have limitations, like assuming negligible acceleration bias impact or accurate rotation estimation by pure monocular SLAM. To address these issues, we propose EDI, a novel approach for fast, accurate, and robust visual-inertial initialization. Our method incorporates an Error-state Kalman Filter (ESKF) to estimate gyroscope bias and correct rotation estimates from monocular SLAM, overcoming dependence on pure monocular SLAM for rotation estimation. To estimate the scale factor without prior information, we offer a closed-form solution for initial velocity, scale, gravity, and acceleration bias estimation. To address gravity and acceleration bias coupling, we introduce weights in the linear least-squares equations, ensuring acceleration bias observability and handling outliers. Extensive evaluation on the EuRoC dataset shows that our method achieves an average scale error of 5.8% in less than 3 seconds, outperforming other state-of-the-art disjoint visual-inertial initialization approaches, even in challenging environments and with artificial noise corruption.</p></details> |  |
| **[PEBO-SLAM: Observer design for visual inertial SLAM with convergence guarantees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12723v1)** | 2023-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a new linear parameterization to the problem of visual inertial simultaneous localization and mapping (VI-SLAM) -- without any approximation -- for the case only using information from a single monocular camera and an inertial measurement unit. In this problem set, the system state evolves on the nonlinear manifold $SE(3)\times \mathbb{R}^{3n}$, on which we design dynamic extensions carefully to generate invariant foliations, such that the problem can be reformulated into online \emph{constant parameter} identification, then interestingly with linear regression models obtained. It demonstrates that VI-SLAM can be translated into a linear least squares problem, in the deterministic sense, \emph{globally} and \emph{exactly}. Based on this observation, we propose a novel SLAM observer, following the recently established parameter estimation-based observer (PEBO) methodology. A notable merit is that the proposed observer enjoys almost global asymptotic stability, requiring neither persistency of excitation nor uniform complete observability, which, however, are widely adopted in most existing works with provable stability but can hardly be assured in many practical scenarios.</p></details> |  |

First, our system directly operates on raw fisheye images, enabling us to fully exploit the wide Field-of-View (FoV) of fisheye cameras. Second, to overcome the low-texture challenge, we explore the tightly-coupled integration of multi-camera inputs and complementary inertial measurements via a unified factor graph and jointly optimize the poses and dense depth maps. Third, for global consistency, the wide FoV of the fisheye camera allows the system to find more potential loop closures, and powered by the broad convergence basin of RFT, our system can perform very wide baseline loop closing with little overlap. Furthermore, we introduce a semi-pose-graph BA method to avoid the expensive full global BA. By combining relative pose factors with loop closure factors, the global states can be adjusted efficiently with modest memory footprint while maintaining high accuracy. Evaluations on TUM-VI, Hilti-Oxford and Newer College datasets show the superior performance of the proposed system over prior works. In the Hilti SLAM Challenge 2022, our VIO version achieves second place. In a subsequent submission, our complete system, including the global BA backend, outperforms the winning approach.</p></details> | Accepted to ICRA2023 |

This task becomes challenging when the problem involves unobservable states. In these situations, it is critical for the algorithm to ``know what it doesn't know'', meaning that it must maintain the unobservable states as unobservable during algorithm deployment. This letter presents general requirements for maintaining consistency in sliding window filters involving unobservable states. The value of these requirements for designing navigation solutions is experimentally shown within the context of visual-inertial SLAM making use of IMU preintegration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main paper accepted to Robotics and Automation Letters.

The paradigm of a centralized architecture is well established, with the robots (i.e. agents) running Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) onboard while communicating relevant data, such as e.g. Keyframes (KFs), to a central back-end (i.e. server), which then merges and optimizes the joint maps of the agents. While these frameworks have proven to be successful, their capability and performance are highly dependent on the choice of the VIO front-end, thus limiting their flexibility. In this work, we present COVINS-G, a generalized back-end building upon the COVINS framework, enabling the compatibility of the server-back-end with any arbitrary VIO front-end, including, for example, off-the-shelf cameras with odometry capabilities, such as the Realsense T265. The COVINS-G back-end deploys a multi-camera relative pose estimation algorithm for computing the loop-closure constraints allowing the system to work purely on 2D image data. In the experimental evaluation, we show on-par accuracy with state-of-the-art multi-session and collaborative SLAM systems, while demonstrating the flexibility and generality of our approach by employing different front-ends onboard collaborating agents within the same mission. The COVINS-G codebase along with a generalized front-end wrapper to allow any existing VIO front-end to be readily used in combination with the proposed collaborative back-end is open-sourced.

A core aspect of UrbanFly is its ability to robustly plan directly on the sparse point clouds generated by a Monocular Visual Inertial SLAM (VINS) backend. It achieves this by using the sparse point clouds to build an uncertainty-integrated cuboid representation of the environment through a data-driven monocular plane segmentation network. Our chosen world model provides faster distance queries than the more common voxel-grid representation, and UrbanFly leverages this capability in two different ways leading to two trajectory optimizers. The first optimizer uses a gradient-free cross-entropy method to compute trajectories that minimize collision probability and smoothness cost. Our second optimizer is a simplified version of the first and uses a sequential convex programming optimizer initialized based on probabilistic safety estimates on a set of randomly drawn trajectories. Both our trajectory optimizers are made computationally tractable and independent of the nature of underlying uncertainty by embedding the distribution of collision violations in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space. Empowered by the algorithmic innovation, UrbanFly outperforms competing baselines in metrics such as collision rate, trajectory length, etc., on a high-fidelity AirSim simulator augmented with synthetic and real-world dataset scenes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ACC 2023, Code available at https://github.com/sudarshan-s-harithas/UrbanFly</p></details> |

Most of the SLAM algorithms are based on assumption that landmarks are static. However, in the real-world, various dynamic objects exist, and they degrade the pose estimation accuracy. In addition, temporarily static objects, which are static during observation but move when they are out of sight, trigger false positive loop closings. To overcome these problems, we propose a novel visual-inertial SLAM framework, called DynaVINS, which is robust against both dynamic objects and temporarily static objects. In our framework, we first present a robust bundle adjustment that could reject the features from dynamic objects by leveraging pose priors estimated by the IMU preintegration. Then, a keyframe grouping and a multi-hypothesis-based constraints grouping methods are proposed to reduce the effect of temporarily static objects in the loop closing. Subsequently, we evaluated our method in a public dataset that contains numerous dynamic objects. Finally, the experimental results corroborate that our DynaVINS has promising performance compared with other state-of-the-art methods by successfully rejecting the effect of dynamic and temporarily static objects.

To achieve that goal, a highly robust and accurate state estimation is indispensable. Combining visual and inertial sensor modalities has proven to yield accurate and locally consistent results in short-term applications. Unfortunately, visual-inertial state estimators suffer from the accumulation of drift for long-term trajectories. To eliminate this drift, global measurements can be fused into the state estimation pipeline. The most known and widely available source of global measurements is the Global Positioning System (GPS). In this paper, we propose a novel approach that fully combines stereo Visual-Inertial Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM), including visual loop closures, with the fusion of global sensor modalities in a tightly-coupled and optimisation-based framework. Incorporating measurement uncertainties, we provide a robust criterion to solve the global reference frame initialisation problem. Furthermore, we propose a loop-closure-like optimisation scheme to compensate drift accumulated during outages in receiving GPS signals. Experimental validation on datasets and in a real-world experiment demonstrates the robustness of our approach to GPS dropouts as well as its capability to estimate highly accurate and globally consistent trajectories compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) 2022</p></details> |

Sparse visual SLAM systems have attained high levels of accuracy and robustness through the inclusion of inertial measurements in a tightly-coupled fusion. Inspired by this performance, we propose the first tightly-coupled dense RGB-D-inertial SLAM system. Our system has real-time capability while running on a GPU. It jointly optimises for the camera pose, velocity, IMU biases and gravity direction while building up a globally consistent, fully dense surfel-based 3D reconstruction of the environment. Through a series of experiments on both synthetic and real world datasets, we show that our dense visual-inertial SLAM system is more robust to fast motions and periods of low texture and low geometric variation than a related RGB-D-only SLAM system.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IROS 2017; supplementary video available at https://youtu.be/-gUdQ0cxDh0</p></details> |

State estimation techniques that rely on non-linear filtering are a strong paradigm for solving the associated information fusion task. The de facto inference method in this space is the celebrated extended Kalman filter (EKF), which relies on first-order linearizations of both the dynamical and measurement model. This paper takes a critical look at the practical implications and limitations posed by the EKF, especially under faulty visual feature associations and the presence of strong confounding noise. As an alternative, we revisit the assumed density formulation of Bayesian filtering and employ a moment matching (unscented Kalman filtering) approach to both visual-inertial odometry and visual SLAM.

Our system leverages a CNN to predict the depth map and the corresponding uncertainty map for each image. The CNN depth effectively bootstraps the back-end optimization of SLAM and meanwhile the CNN uncertainty adaptively weighs the contribution of each feature point to the back-end optimization. Given the gravity direction from the inertial sensor, we further present a fast plane detection method that detects horizontal planes via one-point RANSAC and vertical planes via two-point RANSAC. Those stably detected planes are in turn used to regularize the back-end optimization of SLAM. We evaluate our system on a public dataset, \ie, EuRoC, and demonstrate improved results over a state-of-the-art SLAM system, \ie, ORB-SLAM3.</p></details> |  |

However, real-time performance when incorporating line features in VINS has not been addressed. This paper presents PL-VINS, a real-time optimization-based monocular VINS method with point and line features, developed based on the state-of-the-art point-based VINS-Mono \cite{vins}. We observe that current works use the LSD \cite{lsd} algorithm to extract line features; however, LSD is designed for scene shape representation instead of the pose estimation problem, which becomes the bottleneck for the real-time performance due to its high computational cost. In this paper, a modified LSD algorithm is presented by studying a hidden parameter tuning and length rejection strategy. The modified LSD can run at least three times as fast as LSD. Further, by representing space lines with the Pl\"{u}cker coordinates, the residual error in line estimation is modeled in terms of the point-to-line distance, which is then minimized by iteratively updating the minimum four-parameter orthonormal representation of the Pl\"{u}cker coordinates. Experiments in a public benchmark dataset show that the localization error of our method is 12-16\% less than that of VINS-Mono at the same pose update frequency. %For the benefit of the community, The source code of our method is available at: https://github.com/cnqiangfu/PL-VINS.</p></details> | <details><summary>Visua...</summary><p>Visual-Inertial SLAM, LSD, Lines, SLAM, VINS-Mono</p></details> |

These depth sensors, however, suffer from stereo artefacts and do not provide dense depth estimates.In this work, we present the first self-supervised depth completion method for active stereo systems that predicts accurate dense depth maps. Our system leverages a feature-based visual inertial SLAM system to produce motion estimates and accurate (but sparse) 3D landmarks. The 3D landmarks are used both as model input and as supervision during training. The motion estimates are used in our novel reconstruction loss that relies on a combination of passive and active stereo frames, resulting in significant improvements in textureless areas that are common in indoor environments. Due to the nonexistence of publicly available active stereo datasets, we release a real dataset together with additional information for a publicly available synthetic dataset (TartanAir [42]) needed for active depth completion and prediction. Through rigorous evaluations we show that our method outperforms state of the art on both datasets. Additionally we show how our method obtains more complete, and therefore safer, 3D maps when used in a robotic platform.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to RAL-ICRA 21</p></details> |

This mental model captures geometric and semantic aspects of the scene, describes the environment at multiple levels of abstractions (e.g., objects, rooms, buildings), includes static and dynamic entities and their relations (e.g., a person is in a room at a given time). In contrast, current robots' internal representations still provide a partial and fragmented understanding of the environment, either in the form of a sparse or dense set of geometric primitives (e.g., points, lines, planes, voxels) or as a collection of objects. This paper attempts to reduce the gap between robot and human perception by introducing a novel representation, a 3D Dynamic Scene Graph(DSG), that seamlessly captures metric and semantic aspects of a dynamic environment. A DSG is a layered graph where nodes represent spatial concepts at different levels of abstraction, and edges represent spatio-temporal relations among nodes. Our second contribution is Kimera, the first fully automatic method to build a DSG from visual-inertial data. Kimera includes state-of-the-art techniques for visual-inertial SLAM, metric-semantic 3D reconstruction, object localization, human pose and shape estimation, and scene parsing. Our third contribution is a comprehensive evaluation of Kimera in real-life datasets and photo-realistic simulations, including a newly released dataset, uHumans2, which simulates a collection of crowded indoor and outdoor scenes. Our evaluation shows that Kimera achieves state-of-the-art performance in visual-inertial SLAM, estimates an accurate 3D metric-semantic mesh model in real-time, and builds a DSG of a complex indoor environment with tens of objects and humans in minutes. Our final contribution shows how to use a DSG for real-time hierarchical semantic path-planning.

This article presents COVINS, a novel collaborative SLAM system, that enables multi-agent, scalable SLAM in large environments and for large teams of more than 10 agents. The paradigm here is that each agent runs visual-inertial odomety independently onboard in order to ensure its autonomy, while sharing map information with the COVINS server back-end running on a powerful local PC or a remote cloud server. The server back-end establishes an accurate collaborative global estimate from the contributed data, refining the joint estimate by means of place recognition, global optimization and removal of redundant data, in order to ensure an accurate, but also efficient SLAM process. A thorough evaluation of COVINS reveals increased accuracy of the collaborative SLAM estimates, as well as efficiency in both removing redundant information and reducing the coordination overhead, and demonstrates successful operation in a large-scale mission with 12 agents jointly performing SLAM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Collaborative Visual Inertial SLAM for Multiple Smart Phones](http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.12186v1)** | 2021-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The efficiency and accuracy of mapping are crucial in a large scene and long-term AR applications. Multi-agent cooperative SLAM is the precondition of multi-user AR interaction. The cooperation of multiple smart phones has the potential to improve efficiency and robustness of task completion and can complete tasks that a single agent cannot do. However, it depends on robust communication, efficient location detection, robust mapping, and efficient information sharing among agents. We propose a multi-intelligence collaborative monocular visual-inertial SLAM deployed on multiple ios mobile devices with a centralized architecture. Each agent can independently explore the environment, run a visual-inertial odometry module online, and then send all the measurement information to a central server with higher computing resources. The server manages all the information received, detects overlapping areas, merges and optimizes the map, and shares information with the agents when needed. We have verified the performance of the system in public datasets and real environments. The accuracy of mapping and fusion of the proposed system is comparable to VINS-Mono which requires higher computing resources.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages,4 figures,ICRA2021</p></details> |

The first main novelty is a feature-based tightly-integrated visual-inertial SLAM system that fully relies on Maximum-a-Posteriori (MAP) estimation, even during the IMU initialization phase. The result is a system that operates robustly in real-time, in small and large, indoor and outdoor environments, and is 2 to 5 times more accurate than previous approaches. The second main novelty is a multiple map system that relies on a new place recognition method with improved recall. Thanks to it, ORB-SLAM3 is able to survive to long periods of poor visual information: when it gets lost, it starts a new map that will be seamlessly merged with previous maps when revisiting mapped areas. Compared with visual odometry systems that only use information from the last few seconds, ORB-SLAM3 is the first system able to reuse in all the algorithm stages all previous information. This allows to include in bundle adjustment co-visible keyframes, that provide high parallax observations boosting accuracy, even if they are widely separated in time or if they come from a previous mapping session. Our experiments show that, in all sensor configurations, ORB-SLAM3 is as robust as the best systems available in the literature, and significantly more accurate. Notably, our stereo-inertial SLAM achieves an average accuracy of 3.6 cm on the EuRoC drone and 9 mm under quick hand-held motions in the room of TUM-VI dataset, a setting representative of AR/VR scenarios. For the benefit of the community we make public the source code.</p></details> |  |
| **[Consistent Right-Invariant Fixed-Lag Smoother with Application to Visual Inertial SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.08596v2)** | 2021-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State estimation problems without absolute position measurements routinely arise in navigation of unmanned aerial vehicles, autonomous ground vehicles, etc., whose proper operation relies on accurate state estimates and reliable covariances. Unaware of absolute positions, these problems have immanent unobservable directions. Traditional causal estimators, however, usually gain spurious information on the unobservable directions, leading to over-confident covariance inconsistent with actual estimator errors. The consistency problem of fixed-lag smoothers (FLSs) has only been attacked by the first estimate Jacobian (FEJ) technique because of the complexity to analyze their observability property. But the FEJ has several drawbacks hampering its wide adoption. To ensure the consistency of a FLS, this paper introduces the right invariant error formulation into the FLS framework. To our knowledge, we are the first to analyze the observability of a FLS with the right invariant error. Our main contributions are twofold. As the first novelty, to bypass the complexity of analysis with the classic observability matrix, we show that observability analysis of FLSs can be done equivalently on the linearized system. Second, we prove that the inconsistency issue in the traditional FLS can be elegantly solved by the right invariant error formulation without artificially correcting Jacobians. By applying the proposed FLS to the monocular visual inertial simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem, we confirm that the method consistently estimates covariance similarly to a batch smoother in simulation and that our method achieved comparable accuracy as traditional FLSs on real data.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 4 figures, AAAI 2021 Conference</p></details> |

The front-end module of the state-of-the-art visual-inertial SLAM methods (e.g. visual feature extraction and matching schemes) relies on feature tracks across image frames, which are easily broken in challenging scenarios, resulting in insufficient visual measurement and accumulated error in pose estimation. In this paper, we propose an efficient drift-less SLAM method by re-identifying existing features from a spatial-temporal sensitive sub-global map. The re-identified features over a long time span serve as augmented visual measurements and are incorporated into the optimization module which can gradually decrease the accumulative error in the long run, and further build a drift-less global map in the system. Extensive experiments show that our feature re-identification method is both effective and efficient. Specifically, when combining the feature re-identification with the state-of-the-art SLAM method [11], our method achieves 67.3% and 87.5% absolute translation error reduction with only a small additional computational cost on two public SLAM benchmark DBs: EuRoC and TUM-VI respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, Submitted to ICRA2021</p></details> |

In this paper, firstly we perform an observability analysis w.r.t. the extrinsic parameters before the first turning, which is a complement of the existing results of observability analyses. Secondly, inspired by the above observability analyses, we propose a bidirectional trajectory computation method, by which the poses before the first turning are refined in the backward computation thread, and the real-time trajectory is adjusted accordingly. Experimental results prove that our proposed method not only solves the problem of the unobservability of accelerometer bias and extrinsic parameters before the first turning, but also results in more accurate trajectories in comparison with the state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters</p></details> |

Specifically, in order to achieve real-time operation, existing approaches often assume previously-estimated states to be perfectly known, which leads to inconsistent estimates. Instead, based on the idea of the Schmidt-Kalman filter, which has processing cost linear in the size of the state vector but quadratic memory requirements, we derive a new consistent approximate method in the information domain, which has linear memory requirements and adjustable (constant to linear) processing cost. In particular, this method, the resource-aware inverse Schmidt estimator (RISE), allows trading estimation accuracy for computational efficiency. Furthermore, and in order to better address the requirements of a SLAM system during an exploration vs. a relocalization phase, we employ different configurations of RISE (in terms of the number and order of states updated) to maximize accuracy while preserving efficiency. Lastly, we evaluate the proposed RISE-SLAM algorithm on publicly-available datasets and demonstrate its superiority, both in terms of accuracy and efficiency, as compared to alternative visual-inertial SLAM systems.</p></details> | IROS 2019 |
| **[Deep Depth Estimation from Visual-Inertial SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.00092v2)** | 2020-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the problem of learning to complete a scene's depth from sparse depth points and images of indoor scenes. Specifically, we study the case in which the sparse depth is computed from a visual-inertial simultaneous localization and mapping (VI-SLAM) system. The resulting point cloud has low density, it is noisy, and has non-uniform spatial distribution, as compared to the input from active depth sensors, e.g., LiDAR or Kinect. Since the VI-SLAM produces point clouds only over textured areas, we compensate for the missing depth of the low-texture surfaces by leveraging their planar structures and their surface normals which is an important intermediate representation. The pre-trained surface normal network, however, suffers from large performance degradation when there is a significant difference in the viewing direction (especially the roll angle) of the test image as compared to the trained ones. To address this limitation, we use the available gravity estimate from the VI-SLAM to warp the input image to the orientation prevailing in the training dataset. This results in a significant performance gain for the surface normal estimate, and thus the dense depth estimates. Finally, we show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches both on training (ScanNet and NYUv2) and testing (collected with Azure Kinect) datasets.</p></details> | 9 pages |

Scene graphs are directed graphs where nodes represent entities in the scene (e.g. objects, walls, rooms), and edges represent relations (e.g. inclusion, adjacency) among nodes. Dynamic scene graphs (DSGs) extend this notion to represent dynamic scenes with moving agents (e.g. humans, robots), and to include actionable information that supports planning and decision-making (e.g. spatio-temporal relations, topology at different levels of abstraction). Our second contribution is to provide the first fully automatic Spatial PerceptIon eNgine(SPIN) to build a DSG from visual-inertial data. We integrate state-of-the-art techniques for object and human detection and pose estimation, and we describe how to robustly infer object, robot, and human nodes in crowded scenes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that reconciles visual-inertial SLAM and dense human mesh tracking. Moreover, we provide algorithms to obtain hierarchical representations of indoor environments (e.g. places, structures, rooms) and their relations. Our third contribution is to demonstrate the proposed spatial perception engine in a photo-realistic Unity-based simulator, where we assess its robustness and expressiveness. Finally, we discuss the implications of our proposal on modern robotics applications. 3D Dynamic Scene Graphs can have a profound impact on planning and decision-making, human-robot interaction, long-term autonomy, and scene prediction.

| **[Monocular visual-inertial SLAM algorithm combined with wheel speed anomaly detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.09901v1)** | 2020-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To address the weak observability of monocular visual-inertial odometers on ground-based mobile robots, this paper proposes a monocular inertial SLAM algorithm combined with wheel speed anomaly detection. The algorithm uses a wheel speed odometer pre-integration method to add the wheel speed measurement to the least-squares problem in a tightly coupled manner. For abnormal motion situations, such as skidding and abduction, this paper adopts the Mecanum mobile chassis control method, based on torque control. This method uses the motion constraint error to estimate the reliability of the wheel speed measurement. At the same time, in order to prevent incorrect chassis speed measurements from negatively influencing robot pose estimation, this paper uses three methods to detect abnormal chassis movement and analyze chassis movement status in real time. When the chassis movement is determined to be abnormal, the wheel odometer pre-integration measurement of the current frame is removed from the state estimation equation, thereby ensuring the accuracy and robustness of the state estimation. Experimental results show that the accuracy and robustness of the method in this paper are better than those of a monocular visual-inertial odometer.</p></details> |  |

Conventionally, the performance of visual-inertial SLAM is evaluated with open-loop analysis, with a focus on the drift level of SLAM systems. In this paper, we raise the question on the importance of visual estimation latency in closed-loop navigation tasks, such as accurate trajectory tracking. To understand the impact of both drift and latency on visual-inertial SLAM systems, a closed-loop benchmarking simulation is conducted, where a robot is commanded to follow a desired trajectory using the feedback from visual-inertial estimation. By extensively evaluating the trajectory tracking performance of representative state-of-the-art visual-inertial SLAM systems, we reveal the importance of latency reduction in visual estimation module of these systems. The findings suggest directions of future improvements for visual-inertial SLAM.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures.

The library goes beyond existing visual and visual-inertial SLAM libraries (e.g., ORB-SLAM, VINS- Mono, OKVIS, ROVIO) by enabling mesh reconstruction and semantic labeling in 3D. Kimera is designed with modularity in mind and has four key components: a visual-inertial odometry (VIO) module for fast and accurate state estimation, a robust pose graph optimizer for global trajectory estimation, a lightweight 3D mesher module for fast mesh reconstruction, and a dense 3D metric-semantic reconstruction module. The modules can be run in isolation or in combination, hence Kimera can easily fall back to a state-of-the-art VIO or a full SLAM system. Kimera runs in real-time on a CPU and produces a 3D metric-semantic mesh from semantically labeled images, which can be obtained by modern deep learning methods. We hope that the flexibility, computational efficiency, robustness, and accuracy afforded by Kimera will build a solid basis for future metric-semantic SLAM and perception research, and will allow researchers across multiple areas (e.g., VIO, SLAM, 3D reconstruction, segmentation) to benchmark and prototype their own efforts without having to start from scratch.</p></details> | 8 pages |

Extending visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) with other modalities such as an inertial measurement unit (IMU) can boost robustness and accuracy. However, for a tight sensor fusion, accurate time synchronization of the sensors is often crucial. Changing exposure times, internal sensor filtering, multiple clock sources and unpredictable delays from operation system scheduling and data transfer can make sensor synchronization challenging. In this paper, we present VersaVIS, an Open Versatile Multi-Camera Visual-Inertial Sensor Suite aimed to be an efficient research platform for easy deployment, integration and extension for many mobile robotic applications. VersaVIS provides a complete, open-source hardware, firmware and software bundle to perform time synchronization of multiple cameras with an IMU featuring exposure compensation, host clock translation and independent and stereo camera triggering. The sensor suite supports a wide range of cameras and IMUs to match the requirements of the application. The synchronization accuracy of the framework is evaluated on multiple experiments achieving timing accuracy of less than 1 ms. Furthermore, the applicability and versatility of the sensor suite is demonstrated in multiple applications including visual-inertial SLAM, multi-camera applications, multimodal mapping, reconstruction and object based mapping.</p></details> |  |

In this paper we build on the initialization method proposed by Martinelli and extended by Kaiser et al. , modifying it to be more general and efficient. We improve accuracy with several rounds of visual-inertial bundle adjustment, and robustify the method with novel observability and consensus tests, that discard erroneous solutions. Our results on the EuRoC dataset show that, while the original method produces scale errors up to 156%, our method is able to consistently initialize in less than two seconds with scale errors around 5%, which can be further reduced to less than 1% performing visual-inertial bundle adjustment after ten seconds.</p></details> | <details><summary>2019 ...</summary><p>2019 International Conference on Robotics and Automation</p></details> |

Finally, we present the fully functional system with relative computation andhandling of multiple world co-ordinate system which is able to reduce odometry drift, recover fromcomplicated kidnap scenarios and random odometry failures. We open source our fully functional system as an add-on for the popular VINS-Fusion.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a novel, high-precision, efficient visual-inertial (VI)-SLAM algorithm, termed Schmidt-EKF VI-SLAM (SEVIS), which optimally fuses IMU measurements and monocular images in a tightly-coupled manner to provide 3D motion tracking with bounded error. In particular, we adapt the Schmidt Kalman filter formulation to selectively include informative features in the state vector while treating them as nuisance parameters (or Schmidt states) once they become matured. This change in modeling allows for significant computational savings by no longer needing to constantly update the Schmidt states (or their covariance), while still allowing the EKF to correctly account for their cross-correlations with the active states. As a result, we achieve linear computational complexity in terms of map size, instead of quadratic as in the standard SLAM systems. In order to fully exploit the map information to bound navigation drifts, we advocate efficient keyframe-aided 2D-to-2D feature matching to find reliable correspondences between current 2D visual measurements and 3D map features. The proposed SEVIS is extensively validated in both simulations and experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 2019 Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)</p></details> |
| **[Observability Analysis of Aided INS with Heterogeneous Features of Points, Lines and Planes](http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.05876v1)** | 2018-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we perform a thorough observability analysis for linearized inertial navigation systems (INS) aided by exteroceptive range and/or bearing sensors (such as cameras, LiDAR and sonars) with different geometric features (points, lines and planes). While the observability of vision-aided INS (VINS) with point features has been extensively studied in the literature, we analytically show that the general aided INS with point features preserves the same observability property: that is, 4 unobservable directions, corresponding to the global yaw and the global position of the sensor platform. We further prove that there are at least 5 (and 7) unobservable directions for the linearized aided INS with a single line (and plane) feature; and, for the first time, analytically derive the unobservable subspace for the case of multiple lines/planes. Building upon this, we examine the system observability of the linearized aided INS with different combinations of points, lines and planes, and show that, in general, the system preserves at least 4 unobservable directions, while if global measurements are available, as expected, some unobservable directions diminish. In particular, when using plane features, we propose to use a minimal, closest point (CP) representation; and we also study in-depth the effects of 5 degenerate motions identified on observability. To numerically validate our analysis, we develop and evaluate both EKF-based visual-inertial SLAM and visual-inertial odometry (VIO) using heterogeneous geometric features in Monte Carlo simulations.</p></details> |  |

This is achieved by firstly performing the visual-inertial extended kalman filter(EKF) to provide motion estimate at a high rate. However the filter becomes inconsistent due to the well known linearization issues. So we perform a keyframe-based visual-inertial bundle adjustment to improve the consistency and accuracy of the system. In addition, a loop closure detection and correction module is also added to eliminate the accumulated drift when revisiting an area. Finally, the optimized motion estimates and map are fed back to the EKF-based visual-inertial odometry module, thus the inconsistency and estimation error of the EKF estimator are reduced. In this way, the system can continuously provide reliable motion estimates for the long-term operation. The performance of the algorithm is validated on public datasets and real-world experiments, which proves the superiority of the proposed algorithm.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures |

However, such locally accurate visual-inertial odometry is prone to drift and cannot provide absolute pose estimation. Leveraging history information to relocalize and correct drift has become a hot topic. In this paper, we propose a monocular visual-inertial SLAM system, which can relocalize camera and get the absolute pose in a previous-built map. Then 4-DOF pose graph optimization is performed to correct drifts and achieve global consistent. The 4-DOF contains x, y, z, and yaw angle, which is the actual drifted direction in the visual-inertial system. Furthermore, the proposed system can reuse a map by saving and loading it in an efficient way. Current map and previous map can be merged together by the global pose graph optimization. We validate the accuracy of our system on public datasets and compare against other state-of-the-art algorithms. We also evaluate the map merging ability of our system in the large-scale outdoor environment. The source code of map reuse is integrated into our public code, VINS-Mono.</p></details> | 8 pages |

However, to broaden the adoption of the technology in the real world, we require robust navigation stacks relying only on low-cost sensors such as depth cameras. This paper presents a first step towards a robust localization, mapping, and navigation system for low-cost quadruped robots. In pursuit of this objective we combine contact-aided kinematic, visual-inertial odometry, and depth-stabilized vision, enhancing stability and accuracy of the system. Our results in simulation and two different real-world quadruped platforms show that our system can generate an accurate 2D map of the environment, robustly localize itself, and navigate autonomously. Furthermore, we present in-depth ablation studies of the important components of the system and their impact on localization accuracy.

This framework enables high-precision and highly robust real-time state estimation and map construction in challenging environments, such as LiDAR-degraded, low-texture regions, and feature-scarce areas. The LPVIMO-SAM comprises two subsystems: a Polarized Vision-Inertial System and a LiDAR/Inertial/Magnetometer/Optical Flow System. The polarized vision enhances the robustness of the Visual/Inertial odometry in low-feature and low-texture scenarios by extracting the polarization information of the scene. The magnetometer acquires the heading angle, and the optical flow obtains the speed and height to reduce the accumulated error. A magnetometer heading prior factor, an optical flow speed observation factor, and a height observation factor are designed to eliminate the cumulative errors of the LiDAR/Inertial odometry through factor graph optimization. Meanwhile, the LPVIMO-SAM can maintain stable positioning even when one of the two subsystems fails, further expanding its applicability in LiDAR-degraded, low-texture, and low-feature environments.

Most existing methods rely on implicitly learning a bias term to compensate for raw IMU data. Explicit bias learning has recently shown its potential as a more interpretable and motion-independent alternative. However, it remains underexplored and faces challenges, particularly the need for ground truth bias data, which is rarely available. To address this, we propose a neural ordinary differential equation (NODE) framework that explicitly models continuous bias dynamics, requiring only pose ground truth, often available in datasets. This is achieved by extending the canonical NODE framework to the matrix Lie group for IMU kinematics with a hierarchical training strategy.

This dataset comprises 217 minutes of flight time over 36 experiments using three quadcopters, collecting ultra-wideband (UWB) ranging data such as the raw timestamps and channel-impulse response data, vision data from a stereo camera and a bottom-facing monocular camera, inertial measurement unit data, height measurements from a laser rangefinder, magnetometer data, and ground-truth poses from a motion-capture system. The UWB data is collected from up to 12 transceivers affixed to mobile robots and static tripods in both line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight conditions. The UAVs fly at a maximum speed of 4.418 m/s in an indoor environment with visual fiducial markers as features. MILUV is versatile and can be used for a wide range of applications beyond localization, but the primary purpose of MILUV is for testing and validating multi-robot UWB- and vision-based localization algorithms. The dataset can be downloaded at https://doi.org/10.25452/figshare.plus.28386041.v1. A development kit is presented alongside the MILUV dataset, which includes benchmarking algorithms such as visual-inertial odometry, UWB-based localization using an extended Kalman filter, and classification of CIR data using machine learning approaches.

| **[Multi-Robot Coordination with Adversarial Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09047v1)** | 2025-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates the resilience of perception-based multi-robot coordination with wireless communication to online adversarial perception. A systematic study of this problem is essential for many safety-critical robotic applications that rely on the measurements from learned perception modules. We consider a (small) team of quadrotor robots that rely only on an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and the visual data measurements obtained from a learned multi-task perception module (e.g., object detection) for downstream tasks, including relative localization and coordination. We focus on a class of adversarial perception attacks that cause misclassification, mislocalization, and latency. We propose that the effects of adversarial misclassification and mislocalization can be modeled as sporadic (intermittent) and spurious measurement data for the downstream tasks. To address this, we present a framework for resilience analysis of multi-robot coordination with adversarial measurements. The framework integrates data from Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) and the learned perception model for robust relative localization and state estimation in the presence of adversarially sporadic and spurious measurements. The framework allows for quantifying the degradation in system observability and stability in relation to the success rate of adversarial perception. Finally, experimental results on a multi-robot platform demonstrate the real-world applicability of our methodology for resource-constrained robotic platforms.</p></details> | <details><summary>to ap...</summary><p>to appear at the 2025 Int'l Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems (ICUAS)</p></details> |
| **[HDVIO2.0: Wind and Disturbance Estimation with Hybrid Dynamics VIO](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00969v2)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual-inertial odometry (VIO) is widely used for state estimation in autonomous micro aerial vehicles using onboard sensors. Current methods improve VIO by incorporating a model of the translational vehicle dynamics, yet their performance degrades when faced with low-accuracy vehicle models or continuous external disturbances, like wind. Additionally, incorporating rotational dynamics in these models is computationally intractable when they are deployed in online applications, e.g., in a closed-loop control system. We present HDVIO2.0, which models full 6-DoF, translational and rotational, vehicle dynamics and tightly incorporates them into a VIO with minimal impact on the runtime. HDVIO2.0 builds upon the previous work, HDVIO, and addresses these challenges through a hybrid dynamics model combining a point-mass vehicle model with a learning-based component, with access to control commands and IMU history, to capture complex aerodynamic effects. The key idea behind modeling the rotational dynamics is to represent them with continuous-time functions. HDVIO2.0 leverages the divergence between the actual motion and the predicted motion from the hybrid dynamics model to estimate external forces as well as the robot state. Our system surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art methods in experiments using public and new drone dynamics datasets, as well as real-world flights in winds up to 25 km/h. Unlike existing approaches, we also show that accurate vehicle dynamics predictions are achievable without precise knowledge of the full vehicle state.</p></details> |  |

Existing work usually assumes static race tracks with known maps, which enables offline planning of time-optimal trajectories, performing localization to the gates to reduce the drift in visual-inertial odometry (VIO) for state estimation or training learning-based methods for the particular race track and operating environment. In contrast, many real-world tasks like disaster response or delivery need to be performed in unknown and dynamic environments. To make drone racing more robust against unseen environments and moving gates, we propose a control algorithm that operates without a race track map or VIO, relying solely on monocular measurements of the line of sight to the gates. For this purpose, we adopt the law of proportional navigation (PN) to accurately fly through the gates despite gate motions or wind. We formulate the PN-informed vision-based control problem for drone racing as a constrained optimization problem and derive a closed-form optimal solution. Through simulations and real-world experiments, we demonstrate that our algorithm can navigate through moving gates at high speeds while being robust to different gate movements, model errors, wind, and delays.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 6 figures, accepted to ICRA 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Plug-and-Play Learning-based IMU Bias Factor for Robust Visual-Inertial Odometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12527v1)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The bias of low-cost Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) is a critical factor affecting the performance of Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO). In particular, when visual tracking encounters errors, the optimized bias results may deviate significantly from the true values, adversely impacting the system's stability and localization precision. In this paper, we propose a novel plug-and-play framework featuring the Inertial Prior Network (IPNet), which is designed to accurately estimate IMU bias. Recognizing the substantial impact of initial bias errors in low-cost inertial devices on system performance, our network directly leverages raw IMU data to estimate the mean bias, eliminating the dependency on historical estimates in traditional recursive predictions and effectively preventing error propagation. Furthermore, we introduce an iterative approach to calculate the mean value of the bias for network training, addressing the lack of bias labels in many visual-inertial datasets. The framework is evaluated on two public datasets and one self-collected dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly enhances both localization precision and robustness, with the ATE-RMSE metric improving on average by 46\%.

Providing valuable contextual information about the environment, the prior map is a vital tool for mitigating drift. In this paper, we propose a map-based visual-inertial localization algorithm (NeRF-VIO) with initialization using neural radiance fields (NeRF). Our algorithm utilizes a multilayer perceptron model and redefines the loss function as the geodesic distance on \(SE(3)\), ensuring the invariance of the initialization model under a frame change within \(\mathfrak{se}(3)\). The evaluation demonstrates that our model outperforms existing NeRF-based initialization solution in both accuracy and efficiency. By integrating a two-stage update mechanism within a multi-state constraint Kalman filter (MSCKF) framework, the state of NeRF-VIO is constrained by both captured images from an onboard camera and rendered images from a pre-trained NeRF model. The proposed algorithm is validated using a real-world AR dataset, the results indicate that our two-stage update pipeline outperforms MSCKF across all data sequences.</p></details> |  |

However, the filter-based method has the problem of insufficient accuracy. To this end, we propose the State transformation and Pose-only VIO (SP-VIO) by rebuilding the state and measurement models, and considering further visual deprived conditions. In detail, we first proposed the double state transformation extended Kalman filter (DST-EKF) to replace the standard extended Kalman filter (Std-EKF) for improving the system's consistency, and then adopt pose-only (PO) visual description to avoid the linearization error caused by 3D feature estimation. The comprehensive observability analysis shows that SP-VIO has a more stable unobservable subspace, which can better avoid the inconsistency problem caused by spurious information. Moreover, we propose an enhanced double state transformation Rauch-Tung-Striebel (DST-RTS) backtracking method to optimize motion trajectories during visual interruption. Monte-Carlo simulations and real-world experiments show that SP-VIO has better accuracy and efficiency than state-of-the-art (SOTA) VIO algorithms, and has better robustness under visual deprived conditions.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, for line matching process, we propose a novel geometric line optical flow algorithm that efficiently tracks line features with varying lengths, whitch is do not require detections and descriptors in every frame. To address the instability of Manhattan estimation from line features, we propose a tracking-by-detection module that consistently tracks and optimizes Manhattan framse in consecutive images. By aligning the Manhattan World with the VIO world frame, the tracking could restart using the latest pose from back-end, simplifying the coordinate transformations within the system. Furthermore, we implement a mechanism to validate Manhattan frames and a novel global structural constraints back-end optimization. Extensive experiments results on vairous datasets, including benchmark and self-collected datasets, show that the proposed approach outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy and long-range robustness.

However, real-world scenes often feature dynamic objects, compromising the accuracy of VIO. The diversity and partial occlusion of these objects present a tough challenge for existing dynamic VIO methods. To tackle this challenge, we introduce ADUGS-VINS, which integrates an enhanced SORT algorithm along with a promptable foundation model into VIO, thereby improving pose estimation accuracy in environments with diverse dynamic objects and frequent occlusions. We evaluated our proposed method using multiple public datasets representing various scenes, as well as in a real-world scenario involving diverse dynamic objects. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method performs impressively in multiple scenarios, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods. This highlights its remarkable generalization and adaptability in diverse dynamic environments, showcasing its potential to handle various dynamic objects in practical applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[ESVO2: Direct Visual-Inertial Odometry with Stereo Event Cameras](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09374v3)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event-based visual odometry is a specific branch of visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) techniques, which aims at solving tracking and mapping subproblems (typically in parallel), by exploiting the special working principles of neuromorphic (i.e., event-based) cameras. Due to the motion-dependent nature of event data, explicit data association (i.e., feature matching) under large-baseline view-point changes is difficult to establish, making direct methods a more rational choice. However, state-of-the-art direct methods are limited by the high computational complexity of the mapping sub-problem and the degeneracy of camera pose tracking in certain degrees of freedom (DoF) in rotation. In this paper, we tackle these issues by building an event-based stereo visual-inertial odometry system on top of a direct pipeline. Specifically, to speed up the mapping operation, we propose an efficient strategy for sampling contour points according to the local dynamics of events. The mapping performance is also improved in terms of structure completeness and local smoothness by merging the temporal stereo and static stereo results. To circumvent the degeneracy of camera pose tracking in recovering the pitch and yaw components of general 6-DoF motion, we introduce IMU measurements as motion priors via pre-integration. To this end, a compact back-end is proposed for continuously updating the IMU bias and predicting the linear velocity, enabling an accurate motion prediction for camera pose tracking. The resulting system scales well with modern high-resolution event cameras and leads to better global positioning accuracy in large-scale outdoor environments. Extensive evaluations on five publicly available datasets featuring different resolutions and scenarios justify the superior performance of the proposed system against five state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

By taking sequences of images and 6-DoF inertial measurements as inputs, XIRVIO's generator predicts pose trajectories through an iterative refinement process which are then evaluated by the critic to select the iteration with the optimised prediction. Additionally, the self-emergent adaptive sensor weighting reveals how XIRVIO attends to each sensory input based on contextual cues in the data, making it a promising approach for achieving explainability in safety-critical VIO applications. Evaluations on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that XIRVIO matches well-known state-of-the-art learning-based methods in terms of both translation and rotation errors.</p></details> | 7 pages, 6 figures |

To successfully bootstrap VIO algorithms, the initialization module is extremely important. Most initialization methods rely on the reconstruction of 3D visual point clouds. These methods suffer from high computational cost as state vector contains both motion states and 3D feature points. To address this issue, some researchers recently proposed a structureless initialization method, which can solve the initial state without recovering 3D structure. However, this method potentially compromises performance due to the decoupled estimation of rotation and translation, as well as linear constraints. To improve its accuracy, we propose novel structureless visual-inertial bundle adjustment to further refine previous structureless solution. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show our method significantly improves the VIO initialization accuracy, while maintaining real-time performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICRA 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Robust and Efficient Visual-Inertial Initialization with Probabilistic Normal Epipolar Constraint](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19473v2)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and robust initialization is essential for Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO), as poor initialization can severely degrade pose accuracy. During initialization, it is crucial to estimate parameters such as accelerometer bias, gyroscope bias, initial velocity, gravity, etc. Most existing VIO initialization methods adopt Structure from Motion (SfM) to solve for gyroscope bias. However, SfM is not stable and efficient enough in fast-motion or degenerate scenes. To overcome these limitations, we extended the rotation-translation-decoupled framework by adding new uncertainty parameters and optimization modules. First, we adopt a gyroscope bias estimator that incorporates probabilistic normal epipolar constraints. Second, we fuse IMU and visual measurements to solve for velocity, gravity, and scale efficiently. Finally, we design an additional refinement module that effectively reduces gravity and scale errors. Extensive EuRoC dataset tests show that our method reduces gyroscope bias and rotation errors by 16\% and 4\% on average, and gravity error by 29\% on average. On the TUM dataset, our method reduces the gravity error and scale error by 14.2\% and 5.7\% on average respectively.

These systems, including LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO) and Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO), often face challenges in localization due to adverse environmental conditions such as dust, smoke, and limited visual features. To address these limitations, we propose a novel head-mounted Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) dataset with ground truth, aimed at advancing data-driven IMU pose estimation. Our dataset captures human head motion patterns using a helmet-mounted system, with data from ten participants performing various activities. We explore the application of neural networks, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Transformer networks, to correct IMU biases and improve localization accuracy. Additionally, we evaluate the performance of these methods across different IMU data window dimensions, motion patterns, and sensor types. We release a publicly available dataset, demonstrate the feasibility of advanced neural network approaches for helmet-based localization, and provide evaluation metrics to establish a baseline for future studies in this field.

The method exploits a recurrent neural network using as inputs inertial cues, motor commands, and battery voltage readings alongside the hidden state of the previous time-step to output robust velocity estimates and their associated uncertainty. An ensemble of networks is utilized to enhance the velocity and uncertainty predictions. Fusing the network's outputs into an Extended Kalman Filter, alongside inertial predictions and barometer updates, the method enables long-term underwater odometry without further exteroception. Furthermore, when integrated into visual-inertial odometry, the method assists in enhanced estimation resilience when dealing with an order of magnitude fewer total features tracked (as few as 1) as compared to conventional visual-inertial systems. Tested onboard an underwater robot deployed both in a laboratory pool and the Trondheim Fjord, the method takes less than 5ms for inference either on the CPU or the GPU of an NVIDIA Orin AGX and demonstrates less than 4% relative position error in novel trajectories during complete visual blackout, and approximately 2% relative error when a maximum of 2 visual features from a monocular camera are available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at the 2025 IEEE International Conference on Robotics & Automation (ICRA 2025), Atlanta, USA</p></details> |
| **[A Transformation-based Consistent Estimation Framework: Analysis, Design and Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05008v1)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we investigate the inconsistency problem arising from observability mismatch that frequently occurs in nonlinear systems such as multi-robot cooperative localization and simultaneous localization and mapping. For a general nonlinear system, we discover and theoretically prove that the unobservable subspace of the EKF estimator system is independent of the state and belongs to the unobservable subspace of the original system. On this basis, we establish the necessary and sufficient conditions for achieving observability matching. These theoretical findings motivate us to introduce a linear time-varying transformation to achieve a transformed system possessing a state-independent unobservable subspace. We prove the existence of such transformations and propose two design methodologies for constructing them. Moreover, we propose two equivalent consistent transformation-based EKF estimators, referred to as T-EKF 1 and T-EKF 2, respectively. T-EKF 1 employs the transformed system for consistent estimation, whereas T-EKF 2 leverages the original system but ensures consistency through state and covariance corrections from transformations. To validate our proposed methods, we conduct experiments on several representative examples, including multi-robot cooperative localization, multi-source target tracking, and 3D visual-inertial odometry, demonstrating that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy, consistency, computational efficiency, and practical realizations.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods for initialization often suffer from either poor stability in visual Structure from Motion (SfM) or fragility in solving a huge number of parameters simultaneously. To address these challenges, we propose a new pipeline for visual inertial initialization that robustly handles various complex scenarios. By tightly coupling gyroscope measurements, we enhance the robustness and accuracy of visual SfM. Our method demonstrates stable performance even with only four image frames, yielding competitive results. In terms of feature matching, we introduce a hybrid method that combines optical flow and descriptor-based matching. By leveraging the robustness of continuous optical flow tracking and the accuracy of descriptor matching, our approach achieves efficient, accurate, and robust tracking results. Through evaluation on multiple benchmarks, our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and success rate. Additionally, a video demonstration on mobile devices showcases the practical applicability of our approach in the field of Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality (AR/VR).</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce FastUMI, a substantial redesign of the Universal Manipulation Interface (UMI) system that addresses these challenges by enabling rapid deployment, simplifying hardware-software integration, and delivering robust performance in real-world data acquisition. Compared with UMI, FastUMI has several advantages: 1) It adopts a decoupled hardware design and incorporates extensive mechanical modifications, removing dependencies on specialized robotic components while preserving consistent observation perspectives. 2) It also refines the algorithmic pipeline by replacing complex Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) implementations with an off-the-shelf tracking module, significantly reducing deployment complexity while maintaining accuracy. 3) FastUMI includes an ecosystem for data collection, verification, and integration with both established and newly developed imitation learning algorithms, accelerating policy learning advancement. Additionally, we have open-sourced a high-quality dataset of over 10,000 real-world demonstration trajectories spanning 22 everyday tasks, forming one of the most diverse UMI-like datasets to date. Experimental results confirm that FastUMI facilitates rapid deployment, reduces operational costs and labor demands, and maintains robust performance across diverse manipulation scenarios, thereby advancing scalable data-driven robotic learning.</p></details> |  |

The framework comprises four main components: VIO Front End, 2D Gaussian Map, NVS Loop Closure, and Dynamic Eraser. In the VIO Front End, RGB frames are processed through dense bundle adjustment and uncertainty estimation to extract scene geometry and poses. Based on this output, the mapping module incrementally constructs and maintains a 2D Gaussian map. Key components of the 2D Gaussian Map include a Sample-based Rasterizer, Score Manager, and Pose Refinement, which collectively improve mapping speed and localization accuracy. This enables the SLAM system to handle large-scale urban environments with up to 50 million Gaussian ellipsoids. To ensure global consistency in large-scale scenes, we design a Loop Closure module, which innovatively leverages the Novel View Synthesis (NVS) capabilities of Gaussian Splatting for loop closure detection and correction of the Gaussian map. Additionally, we propose a Dynamic Eraser to address the inevitable presence of dynamic objects in real-world outdoor scenes. Extensive evaluations in indoor and outdoor environments demonstrate that our approach achieves localization performance on par with Visual-Inertial Odometry while surpassing recent GS/NeRF SLAM methods. It also significantly outperforms all existing methods in terms of mapping and rendering quality. Furthermore, we developed a mobile app and verified that our framework can generate high-quality Gaussian maps in real time using only a smartphone camera and a low-frequency IMU sensor. To the best of our knowledge, VINGS-Mono is the first monocular Gaussian SLAM method capable of operating in outdoor environments and supporting kilometer-scale large scenes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Versatile Locomotion Skills for Hexapod Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10628v1)** | 2024-12-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hexapod robots are potentially suitable for carrying out tasks in cluttered environments since they are stable, compact, and light weight. They also have multi-joint legs and variable height bodies that make them good candidates for tasks such as stairs climbing and squeezing under objects in a typical home environment or an attic. Expanding on our previous work on joist climbing in attics, we train a legged hexapod equipped with a depth camera and visual inertial odometry (VIO) to perform three tasks: climbing stairs, avoiding obstacles, and squeezing under obstacles such as a table. Our policies are trained with simulation data only and can be deployed on lowcost hardware not requiring real-time joint state feedback. We train our model in a teacher-student model with 2 phases: In phase 1, we use reinforcement learning with access to privileged information such as height maps and joint feedback. In phase 2, we use supervised learning to distill the model into one with access to only onboard observations, consisting of egocentric depth images and robot pose captured by a tracking VIO camera. By manipulating available privileged information, constructing simulation terrains, and refining reward functions during phase 1 training, we are able to train the robots with skills that are robust in non-ideal physical environments. We demonstrate successful sim-to-real transfer and achieve high success rates across all three tasks in physical experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Drift-free Visual SLAM using Digital Twins](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08496v2)** | 2024-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Globally-consistent localization in urban environments is crucial for autonomous systems such as self-driving vehicles and drones, as well as assistive technologies for visually impaired people. Traditional Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) and Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (VSLAM) methods, though adequate for local pose estimation, suffer from drift in the long term due to reliance on local sensor data. While GPS counteracts this drift, it is unavailable indoors and often unreliable in urban areas. An alternative is to localize the camera to an existing 3D map using visual-feature matching. This can provide centimeter-level accurate localization but is limited by the visual similarities between the current view and the map. This paper introduces a novel approach that achieves accurate and globally-consistent localization by aligning the sparse 3D point cloud generated by the VIO/VSLAM system to a digital twin using point-to-plane matching; no visual data association is needed. The proposed method provides a 6-DoF global measurement tightly integrated into the VIO/VSLAM system. Experiments run on a high-fidelity GPS simulator and real-world data collected from a drone demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art VIO-GPS systems and offers superior robustness against viewpoint changes compared to the state-of-the-art Visual SLAM systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Aerial Collaborative Stereo: Real-Time Cross-Camera Feature Association and Relative Pose Estimation for UAVs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17504v2)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The collaborative visual perception of multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has increasingly become a research hotspot. Compared to a single UAV equipped with a short-baseline stereo camera, multi-UAV collaborative vision offers a wide and variable baseline, providing potential benefits in flexible and large-scale depth perception. In this paper, we propose the concept of a collaborative stereo camera, where the left and right cameras are mounted on two UAVs that share an overlapping FOV. Considering the dynamic flight of two UAVs in the real world, the FOV and relative pose of the left and right cameras are continuously changing. Compared to fixed-baseline stereo cameras, this aerial collaborative stereo system introduces two challenges, which are highly real-time requirements for dynamic cross-camera stereo feature association and relative pose estimation of left and right cameras. To address these challenges, we first propose a real-time dual-channel feature association algorithm with a guidance-prediction structure. Then, we propose a Relative Multi-State Constrained Kalman Filter (Rel-MSCKF) algorithm to estimate the relative pose by fusing co-visual features and UAVs' visual-inertial odometry (VIO). Extensive experiments are performed on the popular onboard computer NVIDIA NX. Results on the resource-constrained platform show that the real-time performance of the dual-channel feature association is significantly superior to traditional methods. The convergence of Rel-MSCKF is assessed under different initial baseline errors. In the end, we present a potential application of aerial collaborative stereo for remote mapping obstacles in urban scenarios. We hope this work can serve as a foundational study for more multi-UAV collaborative vision research. Online video: https://youtu.be/avxMuOf5Qcw</p></details> | 13 pages |
| **[DOGE: An Extrinsic Orientation and Gyroscope Bias Estimation for Visual-Inertial Odometry Initialization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08135v1)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most existing visual-inertial odometry (VIO) initialization methods rely on accurate pre-calibrated extrinsic parameters. However, during long-term use, irreversible structural deformation caused by temperature changes, mechanical squeezing, etc. will cause changes in extrinsic parameters, especially in the rotational part. Existing initialization methods that simultaneously estimate extrinsic parameters suffer from poor robustness, low precision, and long initialization latency due to the need for sufficient translational motion. To address these problems, we propose a novel VIO initialization method, which jointly considers extrinsic orientation and gyroscope bias within the normal epipolar constraints, achieving higher precision and better robustness without delayed rotational calibration. First, a rotation-only constraint is designed for extrinsic orientation and gyroscope bias estimation, which tightly couples gyroscope measurements and visual observations and can be solved in pure-rotation cases. Second, we propose a weighting strategy together with a failure detection strategy to enhance the precision and robustness of the estimator. Finally, we leverage Maximum A Posteriori to refine the results before enough translation parallax comes. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and robustness while maintaining competitive efficiency.</p></details> |  |

These environments are typically challenging for conventional vision-based state estimation due to the lack of distinct visual landmarks and the instability of vehicle poses. To address this, BEVRender generates high-quality local bird's-eye-view(BEV) images of the local terrain. Subsequently, these images are aligned with a geo referenced aerial map through template matching to achieve accurate cross-view registration. Our approach overcomes the inherent limitations of visual inertial odometry systems and the substantial storage requirements of image-retrieval localization strategies, which are susceptible to drift and scalability issues, respectively.

The cutting-edge DU-VIO framework is incorporating a GAN-based pre-processing module and a hybrid CNN-LSTM module for precise pose estimation, using visibility-enhanced underwater images and raw IMU data. Accurate pose estimation is paramount for various underwater robotics and exploration applications. However, underwater visibility is often compromised by suspended particles and attenuation effects, rendering visual-inertial pose estimation a formidable challenge. DU-VIO aims to overcome these limitations by effectively removing visual disturbances from raw image data, enhancing the quality of image features used for pose estimation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DU-VIO by calculating RMSE scores for translation and rotation vectors in comparison to their reference values. These scores are then compared to those of a base model using a modified AQUALOC Dataset. This study's significance lies in its potential to revolutionize underwater robotics and exploration. DU-VIO offers a robust solution to the persistent challenge of underwater visibility, significantly improving the accuracy of pose estimation. This research contributes valuable insights and tools for advancing underwater technology, with far-reaching implications for scientific research, environmental monitoring, and industrial applications.</p></details> |  |

Global Positioning Systems such as GPS and GNSS have been typically used in fusion with Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) for PE. However, the low update rate and lack of proper signals make their utility impractical for indoor and urban applications. On the other hand, Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) is gaining popularity as a practical alternative for GNSS/INS systems in GPS-denied environments. Among the many VIO-based methods, the Multi-State Constraint Kalman Filter (MSCKF) has received a greater attention due to its robustness, speed and accuracy. To this end, the high computational cost associated with image processing for real-time implementation of MSCKF on resource-constrained vehicles is still a challenging ongoing research. In this paper, an enhanced version of the MSCKF is proposed. To this aim, different feature marginalization and state pruning strategies are suggested that result in a much faster algorithm. The proposed algorithm is tested both on an open-source dataset and in real-world experiments for validation. It is demonstrated that the proposed Fast-MSCKF (FMSCKF) is about six times faster and at least 20% more accurate in final position estimation than the standard MSCKF algorithm.</p></details> |  |

While deep learning-based (DL) methods excel at inferring semantic object information from images, such as class and relative 6 degree of freedom (6-DoF) pose, they are computationally demanding and thus often not suitable for payload constrained mobile robots. In this letter we present a real-time capable unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) system for object-relative, closed-loop navigation with a minimal sensor configuration consisting of an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and RGB camera. Utilizing a DL-based object pose estimator, solely trained on synthetic data and optimized for companion board deployment, the object-relative pose measurements are fused with the IMU data to perform object-relative localization. We conduct multiple real-world experiments to validate the performance of our system for the challenging use case of power pole inspection.

Currently, data fusion algorithms for MIMU highly depend on the number of inertial sensors. Based on the assumption that extrinsic parameters between inertial sensors are perfectly calibrated, the fusion algorithm provides better localization accuracy with more IMUs, while neglecting the effect of extrinsic calibration error. Our method builds two non-linear least-squares problems to estimate the MIMU relative position and orientation separately, independent of external sensors and inertial noises online estimation. Then we give the general form of the virtual IMU (VIMU) method and propose its propagation on manifold. We perform our method on datasets, our self-made sensor board, and board with different IMUs, validating the superiority of our method over competing methods concerning speed, accuracy, and robustness. In the simulation experiment, we show that only fusing two IMUs with our calibration method to predict motion can rival nine IMUs. Real-world experiments demonstrate better localization accuracy of the VIO integrated with our calibration method and VIMU propagation on manifold.</p></details> |  |

However, their deployment on resource-constrained devices is non-trivial since large network parameters should be accommodated in the device memory. Furthermore, these networks may risk failure post-deployment due to environmental distribution shifts at test time. In light of this, we propose UL-VIO -- an ultra-lightweight (<1M) VIO network capable of test-time adaptation (TTA) based on visual-inertial consistency. Specifically, we perform model compression to the network while preserving the low-level encoder part, including all BatchNorm parameters for resource-efficient test-time adaptation. It achieves 36X smaller network size than state-of-the-art with a minute increase in error -- 1% on the KITTI dataset. For test-time adaptation, we propose to use the inertia-referred network outputs as pseudo labels and update the BatchNorm parameter for lightweight yet effective adaptation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to perform noise-robust TTA on VIO. Experimental results on the KITTI, EuRoC, and Marulan datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our resource-efficient adaptation method under diverse TTA scenarios with dynamic domain shifts.</p></details> |  |

A sliding window of keyframes is optimized by minimizing re-projection errors, relative inertial errors, and relative magnetometer orientation errors. The results of IMU orientation propagation are used to efficiently transform magnetometer measurements between frames producing relative orientation constraints between consecutive frames. The soft and hard iron effects are calibrated using an ellipsoid fitting algorithm. The introduction of magnetometer data results in significant reductions in the orientation error and also in recovery of the true yaw orientation with respect to the magnetic north. The proposed framework operates in all environments with slow-varying magnetic fields, mainly outdoors and underwater. We have focused our work on the underwater domain, especially in underwater caves, as the narrow passage and turbulent flow make it difficult to perform loop closures and reset the localization drift. The underwater caves present challenges to VIO due to the absence of ambient light and the confined nature of the environment, while also being a crucial source of fresh water and providing valuable historical records. Experimental results from underwater caves demonstrate the improvements in accuracy and robustness introduced by the proposed VIO extension.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal Transformer for Fusion and Pose Estimation in Deep Visual Inertial Odometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08769v1)** | 2024-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, transformer-based architectures become the de facto standard for sequence modeling in deep learning frameworks. Inspired by the successful examples, we propose a causal visual-inertial fusion transformer (VIFT) for pose estimation in deep visual-inertial odometry. This study aims to improve pose estimation accuracy by leveraging the attention mechanisms in transformers, which better utilize historical data compared to the recurrent neural network (RNN) based methods seen in recent methods. Transformers typically require large-scale data for training. To address this issue, we utilize inductive biases for deep VIO networks. Since latent visual-inertial feature vectors encompass essential information for pose estimation, we employ transformers to refine pose estimates by updating latent vectors temporally. Our study also examines the impact of data imbalance and rotation learning methods in supervised end-to-end learning of visual inertial odometry by utilizing specialized gradients in backpropagation for the elements of SE$(3)$ group. The proposed method is end-to-end trainable and requires only a monocular camera and IMU during inference. Experimental results demonstrate that VIFT increases the accuracy of monocular VIO networks, achieving state-of-the-art results when compared to previous methods on the KITTI dataset. The code will be made available at https://github.com/ybkurt/VIFT.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ECCV 2024 2nd Workshop on Vision-Centric Autonomous Driving (VCAD)</p></details> |

Unlike its predecessor, the Mars 2020 mission, which relied on a state estimation system assuming planar terrain, MSH requires a novel approach due to the complex topography of the landing site. This work introduces a novel range-visual-inertial odometry system tailored for the unique challenges of the MSH mission. Our system extends the state-of-the-art xVIO framework by fusing consistent range information with visual and inertial measurements, preventing metric scale drift in the absence of visual-inertial excitation (mono camera and constant velocity descent), and enabling landing on any terrain structure, without requiring any planar terrain assumption. Through extensive testing in image-based simulations using actual terrain structure and textures collected in Mars orbit, we demonstrate that our range-VIO approach estimates terrain-relative velocity meeting the stringent mission requirements, and outperforming existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE/...</summary><p>IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots (IROS), 2024</p></details> |

Also, both Visual Odometry (VO) and Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO) are susceptible to adverse weather conditions that causes occlusions or blur on the visual input. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for vehicle localization that uses street network based map information to correct drifting odometry estimates and intermittent GPS measurements especially, in adversarial scenarios such as driving in rain and tunnels. Specifically, our approach is a flexible fusion algorithm that integrates intermittent GPS, drifting IMU and VO estimates together with 2D map information for robust vehicle localization and tracking. We refer to our approach as Map-Fusion. We robustly evaluate our proposed approach on four geographically diverse datasets from different countries ranging across clear and rain weather conditions. These datasets also include challenging visual segments in tunnels and underpasses. We show that with the integration of the map information, our Map-Fusion algorithm reduces the error of the state-of-the-art VO and VIO approaches across all datasets. We also validate our proposed algorithm in a real-world environment and in real-time on a hardware constrained mobile robot. Map-Fusion achieved 2.46m error in clear weather and 6.05m error in rain weather for a 150m route.</p></details> |  |

LiDAR-based localization is accurate and robust to challenging environmental conditions, but 3D LiDARs are relatively heavy and require large UAV platforms, in contrast to lightweight cameras. However, visual-based self-localization methods exhibit lower accuracy and can suffer from significant drift with respect to the global reference frame. To benefit from both sensory modalities, we focus on cooperative navigation in a heterogeneous team of a primary LiDAR-equipped UAV and a secondary micro-scale camera-equipped UAV. We propose a novel cooperative approach combining LiDAR relative localization data with VIO output on board the primary UAV to obtain an accurate pose of the secondary UAV. The pose estimate is used to precisely and reliably guide the secondary UAV along trajectories defined in the primary UAV reference frame. The experimental evaluation has shown the superior accuracy of our method to the raw VIO output and demonstrated its capability to guide the secondary UAV along desired trajectories while mitigating VIO drift. Thus, such a heterogeneous system can explore large areas with LiDAR precision, as well as visit locations inaccessible to the large LiDAR-carrying UAV platforms, as was showcased in a real-world cooperative mapping scenario.</p></details> | <details><summary>pre-p...</summary><p>pre-print submitted to Journal of Intelligent and Robotic Systems</p></details> |

However, the computational cost of NeRF rendering and degradation in quality due to the presence of artifacts pose significant challenges for its application in real-time and robust robotic tasks, especially on embedded systems. This paper introduces a novel framework that integrates NeRF-derived localization information with Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) to provide a robust solution for real-time robotic navigation. By training an absolute pose regression network with augmented image data rendered from a NeRF and quantifying its uncertainty, our approach effectively counters positional drift and enhances system reliability. We also establish a mathematically sound foundation for combining visual inertial navigation with camera localization neural networks, considering uncertainty under a Bayesian framework. Experimental validation in a photorealistic simulation environment demonstrates significant improvements in accuracy compared to a conventional VIO approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IROS 2024, 8 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Planes are commonplace in man-made environments, offering an active means to reduce drift, due to their extensive spatial and temporal observability. To make full use of planar information, we propose a novel visual-inertial odometry (VIO) using an RGBD camera and an inertial measurement unit (IMU), effectively integrating point and plane features in an extended Kalman filter (EKF) framework. Depth information of point features is leveraged to improve the accuracy of point triangulation, while plane features serve as direct observations added into the state vector. Notably, to benefit long-term navigation,a novel graph-based drift detection strategy is proposed to search overlapping and identical structures in the plane map so that the cumulative drift is suppressed subsequently. The experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate that our system outperforms state-of-the-art methods in localization accuracy and meanwhile generates a compact and consistent plane map, free of expensive global bundle adjustment and loop closing techniques.</p></details> |  |

For a drone equipped with monocular camera and an UGV equipped with LiDAR as an external sensor, we propose a robust and real-time relative pose estimation method (LVCP) based on the tight coupling of vision and LiDAR point cloud information, which does not require prior information such as maps or precise initial poses. Given that large-scale point clouds generated by 3D sensors has more accurate spatial geometric information than the feature point cloud generated by image, we utilize LiDAR point clouds to correct the drift in visual-inertial odometry (VIO) when the camera undergoes significant shaking or the IMU has a low signal-to-noise ratio. To achieve this, we propose a novel coarse-to-fine framework for LiDAR-vision collaborative localization. In this framework, we construct point-plane association based on spatial geometric information, and innovatively construct a point-aided Bundle Adjustment (BA) problem as the backend to simultaneously estimate the relative pose of the camera and LiDAR and correct the VIO drift. In this process, we propose a particle swarm optimization (PSO) based sampling algorithm to complete the coarse estimation of the current camera-LiDAR pose. In this process, the initial pose of the camera used for sampling is obtained based on VIO propagation, and the valid feature-plane association number (VFPN) is used to trigger PSO-sampling process. Additionally, we propose a method that combines Structure from Motion (SFM) and multi-level sampling to initialize the algorithm, addressing the challenge of lacking initial values.</p></details> | <details><summary>See m...</summary><p>See more details in https://sites.google.com/view/lvcp</p></details> |

For parking scenarios, dynamic lighting, sparse textures, and the instability of global positioning system (GPS) signals pose challenges for most traditional localization methods.

Though modern optimization-based algorithms have achieved superior accuracy, the MSCKF-based VIO algorithms are still widely demanded for their efficient and consistent performance. As MSCKF is built upon the conventional multi-view geometry, the measured residuals are not only related to the state errors but also related to the feature position errors. To apply EKF fusion, a projection process is required to remove the feature position error from the observation model, which can lead to model and accuracy degradation. To obtain an efficient visual-inertial fusion model, while also preserving the model consistency, we propose to reconstruct the MSCKF VIO with the novel Pose-Only (PO) multi-view geometry description. In the newly constructed filter, we have modeled PO reprojection residuals, which are solely related to the motion states and thus overcome the requirements of space projection. Moreover, the new filter does not require any feature position information, which removes the computational cost and linearization errors brought in by the 3D reconstruction procedure. We have conducted comprehensive experiments on multiple datasets, where the proposed method has shown accuracy improvements and consistent performance in challenging sequences.</p></details> |  |

A crucial subtask within VIO is the tracking of features, which can be achieved through Optical Flow (OF). As the calculation of OF is a resource-demanding task in terms of computational load and memory footprint, which needs to be executed at low latency, especially in robotic applications, OF estimation is today performed on powerful CPUs or GPUs. This restricts its use in a broad spectrum of applications where the deployment of such powerful, power-hungry processors is unfeasible due to constraints related to cost, size, and power consumption. On-sensor hardware acceleration is a promising approach to enable low latency VIO even on resource-constrained devices such as nano drones. This paper assesses the speed-up in a VIO sensor system exploiting a compact OF sensor consisting of a global shutter camera and an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC). By replacing the feature tracking logic of the VINS-Mono pipeline with data from this OF camera, we demonstrate a 49.4% reduction in latency and a 53.7% reduction of compute load of the VIO pipeline over the original VINS-Mono implementation, allowing VINS-Mono operation up to 50 FPS instead of 20 FPS on the quad-core ARM Cortex-A72 processor of a Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This article has been accepted for publication in the IEEE Sensors Journal (JSEN)</p></details> |

Thanks to a passive detachable mechanism, the interface can be attached/detached from a robot, offering two control modes: local control (attached) and teleoperation (detached). These modes are integrated with a robot whole-body controller and presented in a unified close- and far-proximity control framework for MCR. The earlier introduction of the haptic component in this interface enabled users to execute intricate loco-manipulation tasks via admittance-type control, effectively decoupling task dynamics and enhancing human capabilities. In contrast, this ongoing work proposes a novel design that integrates a visual component. This design utilizes Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) for teleoperation, estimating the interface's pose through stereo cameras and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). The estimated pose serves as the reference for the robot's end-effector in teleoperation mode. Hence, the interface offers complete flexibility and adaptability, enabling any user to operate an MCR seamlessly without needing expert knowledge. In this letter, we primarily focus on the new visual feature, and first present a performance evaluation of different VIO-based methods for teleoperation. Next, the interface's usability is analyzed in a home-care application and compared to an alternative designed by a commercial MoCap system. Results show comparable performance in terms of accuracy, completion time, and usability. Nevertheless, the proposed interface is low-cost, poses minimal wearability constraints, and can be used anywhere and anytime without needing external devices or additional equipment, offering a versatile and accessible solution for teleoperation.</p></details> |  |

However, existing VIO methods lack the generalization ability to adjust to different environments and sensor attributes. In this paper, we propose Adaptive VIO, a new monocular visual-inertial odometry that combines online continual learning with traditional nonlinear optimization. Adaptive VIO comprises two networks to predict visual correspondence and IMU bias. Unlike end-to-end approaches that use networks to fuse the features from two modalities (camera and IMU) and predict poses directly, we combine neural networks with visual-inertial bundle adjustment in our VIO system. The optimized estimates will be fed back to the visual and IMU bias networks, refining the networks in a self-supervised manner. Such a learning-optimization-combined framework and feedback mechanism enable the system to perform online continual learning.

| **[VINS-Multi: A Robust Asynchronous Multi-camera-IMU State Estimator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14539v1)** | 2024-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State estimation is a critical foundational module in robotics applications, where robustness and performance are paramount. Although in recent years, many works have been focusing on improving one of the most widely adopted state estimation methods, visual inertial odometry (VIO), by incorporating multiple cameras, these efforts predominantly address synchronous camera systems. Asynchronous cameras, which offer simpler hardware configurations and enhanced resilience, have been largely overlooked. To fill this gap, this paper presents VINS-Multi, a novel multi-camera-IMU state estimator for asynchronous cameras. The estimator comprises parallel front ends, a front end coordinator, and a back end optimization module capable of handling asynchronous input frames. It utilizes the frames effectively through a dynamic feature number allocation and a frame priority coordination strategy. The proposed estimator is integrated into a customized quadrotor platform and tested in multiple realistic and challenging scenarios to validate its practicality. Additionally, comprehensive benchmark results are provided to showcase the robustness and superior performance of the proposed estimator.</p></details> |  |

However, its performance under varying network setups, especially when combined with IMU data for real-time localization, has not been fully explored so far. In this study, we develop an error state Kalman filter (ESKF) and a pose graph optimization (PGO) approach to address this gap. We systematically evaluate the performance of the derived approaches for real-time MAV localization in realistic scenarios with 5G base stations in Line-Of-Sight (LOS), demonstrating the potential of 5G technologies in this domain. In order to experimentally test and compare our localization approaches, we augment the EuRoC MAV benchmark dataset for visual-inertial odometry with simulated yet highly realistic 5G ToA measurements. Our experimental results comprehensively assess the impact of varying network setups, including varying base station numbers and network configurations, on ToA-based MAV localization performance. The findings show promising results for seamless and robust localization using 5G ToA measurements, achieving an accuracy of 15 cm throughout the entire trajectory within a graph-based framework with five 5G base stations, and an accuracy of up to 34 cm in the case of ESKF-based localization. Additionally, we measure the run time of both algorithms and show that they are both fast enough for real-time implementation.</p></details> |  |

In this paper we approximate distributions at different points in the group in a single set of exponential coordinates and then use classical Gaussian fusion to obtain the fused posteriori in those coordinates. We consider several approximations including the exact Jacobian of the change of coordinate map, first and second order Taylor's expansions of the Jacobian, and parallel transport with and without curvature correction associated with the underlying geometry of the Lie group. Preliminary results on SO(3) demonstrate that a novel approximation using parallel transport with curvature correction achieves similar accuracy to the state-of-the-art optimisation based algorithms at a fraction of the computational cost.</p></details> | Preprint for L-CSS |

It combines visual and inertial measurements to accurately estimate position and orientation. Existing VIO methods assume a fixed noise covariance for the inertial uncertainty. However, accurately determining in real-time the noise variance of the inertial sensors presents a significant challenge as the uncertainty changes throughout the operation leading to suboptimal performance and reduced accuracy. To circumvent this, we propose VIO-DualProNet, a novel approach that utilizes deep learning methods to dynamically estimate the inertial noise uncertainty in real-time. By designing and training a deep neural network to predict inertial noise uncertainty using only inertial sensor measurements, and integrating it into the VINS-Mono algorithm, we demonstrate a substantial improvement in accuracy and robustness, enhancing VIO performance and potentially benefiting other VIO-based systems for precise localization and mapping across diverse conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 15 figures, bib file</p></details> |

Absolute Pose Regressors (APR) are end-to-end machine learning solutions that infer the device's pose from a single monocular image. Thanks to their low computation cost, they can be directly executed on the constrained hardware of mobile AR devices. However, APR methods tend to yield significant inaccuracies for input images that are too distant from the training set. This paper introduces KS-APR, a pipeline that assesses the reliability of an estimated pose with minimal overhead by combining the inference results of the APR and the prior images in the training set. Mobile AR systems tend to rely upon visual-inertial odometry to track the relative pose of the device during the experience. As such, KS-APR favours reliability over frequency, discarding unreliable poses. This pipeline can integrate most existing APR methods to improve accuracy by filtering unreliable images with their pose estimates. We implement the pipeline on three types of APR models on indoor and outdoor datasets. The median error on position and orientation is reduced for all models, and the proportion of large errors is minimized across datasets. Our method enables state-of-the-art APRs such as DFNetdm to outperform single-image and sequential APR methods. These results demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of KS-APR for visual localization tasks that do not require one-shot decisions.</p></details> |  |

Poor outcomes and pain after knee replacement surgery are often linked to patellar mal-tracking. Traditional imaging methods like CT and MRI face challenges, including cost and metal artefacts, and there's currently no ideal way to observe joint motion without issues such as soft tissue artefacts or radiation exposure. A new system to monitor joint motion could significantly improve understanding of PFJ dynamics, aiding in better patient care and outcomes. Combining 2D ultrasound with motion tracking for 3D reconstruction of the joint using semantic segmentation and position registration can be a solution. However, the need for expensive external infrastructure to estimate the trajectories of the scanner remains the main limitation to implementing 3D bone reconstruction from handheld ultrasound scanning clinically. We proposed the Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) and the deep learning-based inertial-only odometry methods as alternatives to motion capture for tracking a handheld ultrasound scanner. The 3D reconstruction generated by these methods has demonstrated potential for assessing the PFJ and for further measurements from free-hand ultrasound scans. The results show that the VIO method performs as well as the motion capture method, with average reconstruction errors of 1.25 mm and 1.21 mm, respectively. The VIO method is the first infrastructure-free method for 3D reconstruction of bone from wireless handheld ultrasound scanning with an accuracy comparable to methods that require external infrastructure.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Medical Measurements & Applications (MeMeA) 2024</p></details> |

Despite their advancements, these methods often encounter dead-reckoning errors that leads to considerable drift in estimated platform motion especially during long traverses. In such cases, the drift error is not negligible and should be rectified. Our proposed approach minimizes the drift error by correcting the estimated motion generated by any SLAM method at each epoch. Our methodology treats positioning measurements rendered by the SLAM solution as random variables formulated jointly in a multivariate distribution. In this setting, The correction of the drift becomes equivalent to finding the mode of this multivariate distribution which jointly maximizes the likelihood of a set of relevant geo-spatial priors about the platform motion and environment. Our method is integrable into any SLAM/VIO method as an correction module. Our experimental results shows the effectiveness of our approach in minimizing the drift error by 10x in long treverses.</p></details> |  |

Such temporal misalignment introduces inconsistent constraints for state estimation, leading to a significant positioning drift especially in high dynamic motion scenarios. In this article, we focus on online temporal calibration to reduce the positioning drift caused by the time offset for high dynamic motion VIO. For the time offset observation model, most existing methods rely on accurate state estimation or stable visual tracking. For the prediction model, current methods oversimplify the time offset as a constant value with white Gaussian noise. However, these ideal conditions are seldom satisfied in real high dynamic scenarios, resulting in the poor performance. In this paper, we introduce online time offset modeling networks (TON) to enhance real-time temporal calibration. TON improves the accuracy of time offset observation and prediction modeling. Specifically, for observation modeling, we propose feature velocity observation networks to enhance velocity computation for features in unstable visual tracking conditions. For prediction modeling, we present time offset prediction networks to learn its evolution pattern. To highlight the effectiveness of our method, we integrate the proposed TON into both optimization-based and filter-based VIO systems. Simulation and real-world experiments are conducted to demonstrate the enhanced performance of our approach. Additionally, to contribute to the VIO community, we will open-source the code of our method on: https://github.com/Franky-X/FVON-TPN.</p></details> |  |

The proposed HDA_LVIO system can be divided into two subsystems: the LiDAR-Inertial subsystem (LIS) and the Visual-Inertial subsystem (VIS). In the LIS, the LiDAR pointcloud is utilized to calculate the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) error, serving as the measurement value of Error State Iterated Kalman Filter (ESIKF) to construct the global map. In the VIS, an incremental method is firstly employed to adaptively extract planes from the global map. And the centroids of these planes are projected onto the image to obtain projection points. Then, feature points are extracted from the image and tracked along with projection points using Lucas-Kanade (LK) optical flow. Next, leveraging the vehicle states from previous intervals, sliding window optimization is performed to estimate the depth of feature points. Concurrently, a method based on epipolar geometric constraints is proposed to address tracking failures for feature points, which can improve the accuracy of depth estimation for feature points by ensuring sufficient parallax within the sliding window. Subsequently, the feature points and projection points are hybridly associated to construct reprojection error, serving as the measurement value of ESIKF to estimate vehicle states. Finally, the localization accuracy of the proposed HDA-LVIO is validated using public datasets and data from our equipment. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves obviously improvement in localization accuracy compared to various existing algorithms.</p></details> |  |

Despite event-based visual odometry having been extensively studied in recent years, most of them are based on monocular and few research on stereo event vision. In this paper, we present ESVIO, the first event-based stereo visual-inertial odometry, which leverages the complementary advantages of event streams, standard images and inertial measurements. Our proposed pipeline achieves temporal tracking and instantaneous matching between consecutive stereo event streams, thereby obtaining robust state estimation. In addition, the motion compensation method is designed to emphasize the edge of scenes by warping each event to reference moments with IMU and ESVIO back-end. We validate that both ESIO (purely event-based) and ESVIO (event with image-aided) have superior performance compared with other image-based and event-based baseline methods on public and self-collected datasets. Furthermore, we use our pipeline to perform onboard quadrotor flights under low-light environments. A real-world large-scale experiment is also conducted to demonstrate long-term effectiveness. We highlight that this work is a real-time, accurate system that is aimed at robust state estimation under challenging environments.</p></details> |  |

Existing fixed-class models limit the adaptability of indoor mobile and assistive autonomous systems. In this work, we introduce LEXIS, a real-time indoor Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) system that harnesses the open-vocabulary nature of Large Language Models (LLMs) to create a unified approach to scene understanding and place recognition. The approach first builds a topological SLAM graph of the environment (using visual-inertial odometry) and embeds Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) features in the graph nodes. We use this representation for flexible room classification and segmentation, serving as a basis for room-centric place recognition. This allows loop closure searches to be directed towards semantically relevant places. Our proposed system is evaluated using both public, simulated data and real-world data, covering office and home environments. It successfully categorizes rooms with varying layouts and dimensions and outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA). For place recognition and trajectory estimation tasks we achieve equivalent performance to the SOTA, all also utilizing the same pre-trained model.

In this work, we design a novel visual-inertial odometry (VIO) system called RD-VIO to handle both of these two problems. Firstly, we propose an IMU-PARSAC algorithm which can robustly detect and match keypoints in a two-stage process. In the first state, landmarks are matched with new keypoints using visual and IMU measurements. We collect statistical information from the matching and then guide the intra-keypoint matching in the second stage. Secondly, to handle the problem of pure rotation, we detect the motion type and adapt the deferred-triangulation technique during the data-association process. We make the pure-rotational frames into the special subframes. When solving the visual-inertial bundle adjustment, they provide additional constraints to the pure-rotational motion. We evaluate the proposed VIO system on public datasets and online comparison. Experiments show the proposed RD-VIO has obvious advantages over other methods in dynamic environments.

However, accurate absolute pose estimation techniques are computation- and storage-heavy, requiring computation offloading. As such, AR systems rely on visual-inertial odometry (VIO) to track the device's relative pose between requests to the server. However, VIO suffers from drift, requiring frequent absolute repositioning. This paper introduces MobileARLoc, a new framework for on-device large-scale markerless mobile AR that combines an absolute pose regressor (APR) with a local VIO tracking system. Absolute pose regressors (APRs) provide fast on-device pose estimation at the cost of reduced accuracy. To address APR accuracy and reduce VIO drift, MobileARLoc creates a feedback loop where VIO pose estimations refine the APR predictions. The VIO system identifies reliable predictions of APR, which are then used to compensate for the VIO drift. We comprehensively evaluate MobileARLoc through dataset simulations. MobileARLoc halves the error compared to the underlying APR and achieve fast (80\,ms) on-device inference speed.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the 3rd edition of the Pervasive and Resource-Constrained AI (PerConAI) workshop (co-located with PerCom 2024).

These algorithms depend on scene continuity, hence requires frequent camera inputs. However, processing images frequently can lead to significant memory usage and computation overhead. In this study, we introduce SemanticSLAM, an end-to-end visual-inertial odometry system that utilizes semantic features extracted from an RGB-D sensor. This approach enables the creation of a semantic map of the environment and ensures reliable camera localization. SemanticSLAM is scene-agnostic, which means it doesn't require retraining for different environments. It operates effectively in indoor settings, even with infrequent camera input, without prior knowledge. The strength of SemanticSLAM lies in its ability to gradually refine the semantic map and improve pose estimation. This is achieved by a convolutional long-short-term-memory (ConvLSTM) network, trained to correct errors during map construction. Compared to existing VSLAM algorithms, SemanticSLAM improves pose estimation by 17%. The resulting semantic map provides interpretable information about the environment and can be easily applied to various downstream tasks, such as path planning, obstacle avoidance, and robot navigation.

| **[Tight Fusion of Events and Inertial Measurements for Direct Velocity Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09296v1)** | 2024-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional visual-inertial state estimation targets absolute camera poses and spatial landmark locations while first-order kinematics are typically resolved as an implicitly estimated sub-state. However, this poses a risk in velocity-based control scenarios, as the quality of the estimation of kinematics depends on the stability of absolute camera and landmark coordinates estimation. To address this issue, we propose a novel solution to tight visual-inertial fusion directly at the level of first-order kinematics by employing a dynamic vision sensor instead of a normal camera. More specifically, we leverage trifocal tensor geometry to establish an incidence relation that directly depends on events and camera velocity, and demonstrate how velocity estimates in highly dynamic situations can be obtained over short time intervals. Noise and outliers are dealt with using a nested two-layer RANSAC scheme. Additionally, smooth velocity signals are obtained from a tight fusion with pre-integrated inertial signals using a sliding window optimizer. Experiments on both simulated and real data demonstrate that the proposed tight event-inertial fusion leads to continuous and reliable velocity estimation in highly dynamic scenarios independently of absolute coordinates. Furthermore, in extreme cases, it achieves more stable and more accurate estimation of kinematics than traditional, point-position-based visual-inertial odometry.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Robotics (T-RO)</p></details> |

The second FLS estimates smooth corrections to VIO to generate pose estimates at a high rate for online control. The proposed method is lightweight and can run on a computationally constrained micro-aerial vehicle (MAV). We validate our approach through closed-loop flight tests involving dynamic trajectories in multiple real-world cluttered indoor environments. Our method achieves decimeter-to-sub-decimeter-level positioning accuracy using off-the-shelf sensors and decimeter-level tracking accuracy with minimally-tuned open-source controllers.</p></details> |  |

However, the accuracy of VIO is often compromised by photometric changes, weak textures and motion blur, unlike the more robust LIO. This paper introduces SR-LIVO, an advanced and novel LIV-SLAM system employing sweep reconstruction to align reconstructed sweeps with image timestamps. This allows the LIO module to accurately determine states at all imaging moments, enhancing pose accuracy and processing efficiency. Experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate that: 1) our SRLIVO outperforms existing state-of-the-art LIV-SLAM systems in both pose accuracy and time efficiency; 2) our LIO-based pose estimation prove more accurate than VIO-based ones in several mainstream LIV-SLAM systems (including ours). We have released our source code to contribute to the community development in this field.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 6 figures, submitted to IEEE RA-L</p></details> |

We define a symmetry group and corresponding group action that allow specifically the design of an equivariant filter for the problem of visual-inertial odometry (VIO) including IMU bias, and camera intrinsic and extrinsic calibration states. In contrast to state-of-the-art invariant extended Kalman filter (IEKF) approaches that simply tack IMU bias and other states onto the $\mathbf{SE}_2(3)$ group, our filter builds upon a symmetry that properly includes all the states in the group structure. Thus, we achieve improved behavior, particularly when linearization points largely deviate from the truth (i.e., on transients upon state disturbances). Our approach is inherently consistent even during convergence phases from significant errors without the need for error uncertainty adaptation, observability constraint, or other consistency enforcing techniques. This leads to greatly improved estimator behavior for significant error and unexpected state changes during, e.g., long-duration missions. We evaluate our approach with a multitude of different experiments using three different prominent real-world datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L), 2023</p></details> |
| **[Homography Initialization and Dynamic Weighting Algorithm Based on a Downward-Looking Camera and IMU](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09622v1)** | 2023-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the technology in visual-inertial odometry (VIO) has matured considerably and has been widely used in many applications. However, we still encounter challenges when applying VIO to a micro air vehicle (MAV) equipped with a downward-looking camera. Specifically, VIO cannot compute the correct initialization results during take-off and the cumulative drift is large when the MAV is flying in the air. To overcome these problems, we propose a homographybased initialization method, which utilizes the fact that the features detected by the downward-looking camera during take-off are approximately on the same plane. Then we introduce the prior normal vector and motion field to make states more accurate. In addition, to deal with the cumulative drift, a strategy for dynamically weighting visual residuals is proposed. Finally, we evaluate our method on the collected real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that our system can be successfully initialized no matter how the MAV takes off and the positioning errors are also greatly improved.</p></details> |  |

In most human-built scenes often with low features, lines can be considered complements to points. In this paper, we present a multi-robot cooperative visual-inertial navigation system (VINS) using both point and line features. By utilizing the covariance intersection (CI) update within the multi-state constraint Kalman filter (MSCKF) framework, each robot exploits not only its own point and line measurements, but also constraints of common point and common line features observed by its neighbors. The line features are parameterized and updated by utilizing the Closest Point representation. The proposed algorithm is validated extensively in both Monte-Carlo simulations and a real-world dataset. The results show that the point-line cooperative visual-inertial odometry (PL-CVIO) outperforms the independent MSCKF and our previous work CVIO in both low-feature and rich-feature environments.</p></details> |  |

Conventional EKF-based VIO usually suffers from system inconsistency and angular drift that naturally occurs in feature-based methods. However, in man-made environments, notable structural regularities, such as lines and vanishing points, offer valuable cues for localization. To exploit these structural features effectively and maintain system consistency, we design a right invariant filter-based VIO scheme incorporating point, line, and vanishing point features. We demonstrate that the conventional additive error definition for point features can also preserve system consistency like the invariant error definition by proving a mathematically equivalent measurement model. And a similar conclusion is established for line features. Additionally, we conduct an invariant filter-based observability analysis proving that vanishing point measurement maintains unobservable directions naturally. Both simulation and real-world tests are conducted to validate our methods' pose accuracy and consistency. The experimental results validate the competitive performance of our method, highlighting its ability to deliver accurate and consistent pose estimation in man-made environments.</p></details> | ROBIO 2023 |
| **[Inertial Guided Uncertainty Estimation of Feature Correspondence in Visual-Inertial Odometry/SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03722v1)** | 2023-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual odometry and Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) has been studied as one of the most important tasks in the areas of computer vision and robotics, to contribute to autonomous navigation and augmented reality systems. In case of feature-based odometry/SLAM, a moving visual sensor observes a set of 3D points from different viewpoints, correspondences between the projected 2D points in each image are usually established by feature tracking and matching. However, since the corresponding point could be erroneous and noisy, reliable uncertainty estimation can improve the accuracy of odometry/SLAM methods. In addition, inertial measurement unit is utilized to aid the visual sensor in terms of Visual-Inertial fusion. In this paper, we propose a method to estimate the uncertainty of feature correspondence using an inertial guidance robust to image degradation caused by motion blur, illumination change and occlusion. Modeling a guidance distribution to sample possible correspondence, we fit the distribution to an energy function based on image error, yielding more robust uncertainty than conventional methods. We also demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by incorporating it into one of recent visual-inertial odometry/SLAM algorithms for public datasets.</p></details> | 12 pages |

The model is self-calibrating in real-time and is free of known correspondences or calibration targets. It is separable as a distortion model (dependent on refractive index $n$ and radial pixel coordinate) and a virtual pinhole model (as a function of $n$). We derive the self-calibration formulation leveraging epipolar constraints to estimate the refractive index and subsequently correct for distortion. Through experimental studies using an underwater robot integrating cameras and inertial sensing, the model is validated regarding the accurate estimation of the refractive index and its benefits for robust odometry estimation in an extended envelope of conditions. Lastly, we show the transition between media and the estimation of the varying refractive index online, thus allowing computer vision tasks across refractive media.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 6 figures, Submitted to the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, 2024</p></details> |

Current methods either rely heavily on GNSS, face limitations in visual-based localization due to appearance variances and stylistic dissimilarities between camera and reference imagery, or operate under the assumption of a known initial pose. In this paper, we developed a GNSS-denied localization approach for UAVs that harnesses both Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) and Visual Place Recognition (VPR) using a foundation model. This paper presents a novel vision-based pipeline that works exclusively with a nadir-facing camera, an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), and pre-existing satellite imagery for robust, accurate localization in varied environments and conditions. Our system demonstrated average localization accuracy within a $20$-meter range, with a minimum error below $1$ meter, under real-world conditions marked by drastic changes in environmental appearance and with no assumption of the vehicle's initial pose. The method is proven to be effective and robust, addressing the crucial need for reliable UAV localization in GNSS-denied environments, while also being computationally efficient enough to be deployed on resource-constrained platforms.</p></details> |  |
| **[LF-VISLAM: A SLAM Framework for Large Field-of-View Cameras with Negative Imaging Plane on Mobile Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05167v3)** | 2023-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) has become a crucial aspect in the fields of autonomous driving and robotics. One crucial component of visual SLAM is the Field-of-View (FoV) of the camera, as a larger FoV allows for a wider range of surrounding elements and features to be perceived. However, when the FoV of the camera reaches the negative half-plane, traditional methods for representing image feature points using [u,v,1]^T become ineffective. While the panoramic FoV is advantageous for loop closure, its benefits are not easily realized under large-attitude-angle differences where loop-closure frames cannot be easily matched by existing methods. As loop closure on wide-FoV panoramic data further comes with a large number of outliers, traditional outlier rejection methods are not directly applicable. To address these issues, we propose LF-VISLAM, a Visual Inertial SLAM framework for cameras with extremely Large FoV with loop closure. A three-dimensional vector with unit length is introduced to effectively represent feature points even on the negative half-plane. The attitude information of the SLAM system is leveraged to guide the feature point detection of the loop closure. Additionally, a new outlier rejection method based on the unit length representation is integrated into the loop closure module. We collect the PALVIO dataset using a Panoramic Annular Lens (PAL) system with an entire FoV of 360{\deg}x(40{\deg}~120{\deg}) and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) for Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO) to address the lack of panoramic SLAM datasets. Experiments on the established PALVIO and public datasets show that the proposed LF-VISLAM outperforms state-of-the-art SLAM methods.

| **[PL-EVIO: Robust Monocular Event-based Visual Inertial Odometry with Point and Line Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12160v2)** | 2023-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event cameras are motion-activated sensors that capture pixel-level illumination changes instead of the intensity image with a fixed frame rate. Compared with the standard cameras, it can provide reliable visual perception during high-speed motions and in high dynamic range scenarios. However, event cameras output only a little information or even noise when the relative motion between the camera and the scene is limited, such as in a still state. While standard cameras can provide rich perception information in most scenarios, especially in good lighting conditions. These two cameras are exactly complementary. In this paper, we proposed a robust, high-accurate, and real-time optimization-based monocular event-based visual-inertial odometry (VIO) method with event-corner features, line-based event features, and point-based image features. The proposed method offers to leverage the point-based features in the nature scene and line-based features in the human-made scene to provide more additional structure or constraints information through well-design feature management. Experiments in the public benchmark datasets show that our method can achieve superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art image-based or event-based VIO. Finally, we used our method to demonstrate an onboard closed-loop autonomous quadrotor flight and large-scale outdoor experiments. Videos of the evaluations are presented on our project website: https://b23.tv/OE3QM6j</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Localization with Visual-Inertial Odometry Constraints for Markerless Mobile AR](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05394v2)** | 2023-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO) is an essential component of modern Augmented Reality (AR) applications. However, VIO only tracks the relative pose of the device, leading to drift over time. Absolute pose estimation methods infer the device's absolute pose, but their accuracy depends on the input quality. This paper introduces VIO-APR, a new framework for markerless mobile AR that combines an absolute pose regressor (APR) with a local VIO tracking system. VIO-APR uses VIO to assess the reliability of the APR and the APR to identify and compensate for VIO drift. This feedback loop results in more accurate positioning and more stable AR experiences. To evaluate VIO-APR, we created a dataset that combines camera images with ARKit's VIO system output for six indoor and outdoor scenes of various scales. Over this dataset, VIO-APR improves the median accuracy of popular APR by up to 36\% in position and 29\% in orientation, increases the percentage of frames in the high ($0.25 m, 2^{\circ}$) accuracy level by up to 112\% and reduces the percentage of frames predicted below the low ($5 m, 10^\circ$) accuracy greatly. We implement VIO-APR into a mobile AR application using Unity to demonstrate its capabilities. VIO-APR results in noticeably more accurate localization and a more stable overall experience.</p></details> |  |

We propose a sparse point aided multi-view stereo neural network (SPA-MVSNet) that can effectively leverage the informative but noisy sparse points from the VIO system. The sparse depth from VIO is firstly completed by a single-view depth completion network. This dense depth map, although naturally limited in accuracy, is then used as a prior to guide our MVS network in the cost volume generation and regularization for accurate dense depth prediction. Predicted depth maps of keyframe images by the MVS network are incrementally fused into a global map using TSDF-Fusion. We extensively evaluate both the proposed SPA-MVSNet and the entire visual-inertial dense mapping system on several public datasets as well as our own dataset, demonstrating the system's impressive generalization capabilities and its ability to deliver high-quality 3D mesh reconstruction online. Our proposed dense mapping system achieves a 39.7% improvement in F-score over existing systems when evaluated on the challenging scenarios of the EuRoC dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Path-Constrained State Estimation for Rail Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12082v1)** | 2023-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Globally rising demand for transportation by rail is pushing existing infrastructure to its capacity limits, necessitating the development of accurate, robust, and high-frequency positioning systems to ensure safe and efficient train operation. As individual sensor modalities cannot satisfy the strict requirements of robustness and safety, a combination thereof is required. We propose a path-constrained sensor fusion framework to integrate various modalities while leveraging the unique characteristics of the railway network. To reflect the constrained motion of rail vehicles along their tracks, the state is modeled in 1D along the track geometry. We further leverage the limited action space of a train by employing a novel multi-hypothesis tracking to account for multiple possible trajectories a vehicle can take through the railway network. We demonstrate the reliability and accuracy of our fusion framework on multiple tram datasets recorded in the city of Zurich, utilizing Visual-Inertial Odometry for local motion estimation and a standard GNSS for global localization. We evaluate our results using ground truth localizations recorded with a RTK-GNSS, and compare our method to standard baselines. A Root Mean Square Error of 4.78 m and a track selectivity score of up to 94.9 % have been achieved.</p></details> |  |

To enable such comprehension, 3D scene graphs have emerged as a robust tool for representing the environment as a layered graph of concepts and their relationships. However, building these representations using monocular vision systems in real-time remains a difficult task that has not been explored in depth. This paper puts forth a real-time spatial perception system Mono-Hydra, combining a monocular camera and an IMU sensor setup, focusing on indoor scenarios. However, the proposed approach is adaptable to outdoor applications, offering flexibility in its potential uses. The system employs a suite of deep learning algorithms to derive depth and semantics. It uses a robocentric visual-inertial odometry (VIO) algorithm based on square-root information, thereby ensuring consistent visual odometry with an IMU and a monocular camera. This system achieves sub-20 cm error in real-time processing at 15 fps, enabling real-time 3D scene graph construction using a laptop GPU (NVIDIA 3080). This enhances decision-making efficiency and effectiveness in simple camera setups, augmenting robotic system agility.

In order to include range measurements in state estimation, the position of the UWB anchors must be known. This study proposes a multi-step initialization procedure to map multiple unknown anchors by an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), in a fully autonomous fashion. To address the limitations of initializing UWB anchors via a random trajectory, this paper uses the Geometric Dilution of Precision (GDOP) as a measure of optimality in anchor position estimation, to compute a set of optimal waypoints and synthesize a trajectory that minimizes the mapping uncertainty. After the initialization is complete, the range measurements from multiple anchors, including measurement biases, are tightly integrated into the VIO system. While in range of the initialized anchors, the VIO drift in position and heading is eliminated. The effectiveness of UVIO and our initialization procedure has been validated through a series of simulations and real-world experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stereo Event-based Visual-Inertial Odometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05086v4)** | 2023-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event-based cameras are new type vision sensors whose pixels work independently and respond asynchronously to brightness change with microsecond resolution, instead of providing standard intensity frames. Compared with traditional cameras, event-based cameras have low latency, no motion blur, and high dynamic range (HDR), which provide possibilities for robots to deal with some challenging scenes. We propose a visual-inertial odometry for stereo event-based cameras based on Error-State Kalman Filter (ESKF). The visual module updates the pose relies on the edge alignment of a semi-dense 3D map to a 2D image, and the IMU module updates pose by median integral. We evaluate our method on public datasets with general 6-DoF motion and compare the results against ground truth. We show that our proposed pipeline provides improved accuracy over the result of the state-of-the-art visual odometry for stereo event-based cameras, while running in real-time on a standard CPU (low-resolution cameras). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first published visual-inertial odometry for stereo event-based cameras.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Control of Smart Particle Swarms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.07195v2)** | 2023-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a method for the control of robot swarms using two subsets of robots: a larger group of simple, oblivious robots (which we call the workers) that is governed by simple local attraction forces, and a smaller group (the guides) with sufficient mission knowledge to create and displace a desired worker formation by operating on the local forces of the workers. The guides coordinate to shape the workers like smart particles by changing their interaction parameters. We study the approach with a large scale experiment in a physics based simulator with up to 5000 robots forming three different patterns. Our experiments reveal that the approach scales well with increasing robot numbers, and presents little pattern distortion. We evaluate the approach on a physical swarm of robots that use visual inertial odometry to compute their relative positions and obtain results that are comparable with simulation. This work lays the foundation for designing and coordinating configurable smart particles, with applications in smart materials and nanomedicine.</p></details> | 7 pages, 9 figures |
| **[HDVIO: Improving Localization and Disturbance Estimation with Hybrid Dynamics VIO](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11429v2)** | 2023-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual-inertial odometry (VIO) is the most common approach for estimating the state of autonomous micro aerial vehicles using only onboard sensors. Existing methods improve VIO performance by including a dynamics model in the estimation pipeline. However, such methods degrade in the presence of low-fidelity vehicle models and continuous external disturbances, such as wind. Our proposed method, HDVIO, overcomes these limitations by using a hybrid dynamics model that combines a point-mass vehicle model with a learning-based component that captures complex aerodynamic effects. HDVIO estimates the external force and the full robot state by leveraging the discrepancy between the actual motion and the predicted motion of the hybrid dynamics model. Our hybrid dynamics model uses a history of thrust and IMU measurements to predict the vehicle dynamics. To demonstrate the performance of our method, we present results on both public and novel drone dynamics datasets and show real-world experiments of a quadrotor flying in strong winds up to 25 km/h. The results show that our approach improves the motion and external force estimation compared to the state-of-the-art by up to 33% and 40%, respectively. Furthermore, differently from existing methods, we show that it is possible to predict the vehicle dynamics accurately while having no explicit knowledge of its full state.</p></details> |  |

However, it has been meeting challenges in vehicular scenarios due to limited dynamics and lack of stable features. In this paper, we propose Ground-VIO, which utilizes ground features and the specific camera-ground geometry to enhance monocular VIO performance in realistic road environments. In the method, the camera-ground geometry is modeled with vehicle-centered parameters and integrated into an optimization-based VIO framework. These parameters could be calibrated online and simultaneously improve the odometry accuracy by providing stable scale-awareness. Besides, a specially designed visual front-end is developed to stably extract and track ground features via the inverse perspective mapping (IPM) technique. Both simulation tests and real-world experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that our implementation could dramatically improve monocular VIO accuracy in vehicular scenarios, achieving comparable or even better performance than state-of-art stereo VIO solutions. The system could also be used for the auto-calibration of IPM which is widely used in vehicle perception. A toolkit for ground feature processing, together with the experimental datasets, would be made open-source (https://github.com/GREAT-WHU/gv_tools).</p></details> |  |

However, the direct method is sensitive to photometric changes, which can be compensated by introducing geometric information in the environment. In this paper, we propose a monocular direct sparse visual-inertial odometry, which exploits the planar regularities (PVI-DSO). Our system detects the planar regularities from the 3D mesh built on the estimated map points. To improve the pose estimation accuracy with the geometric information, a tightly coupled coplanar constraint expression is used to express photometric error in the direct method. Additionally, to improve the optimization efficiency, we elaborately derive the analytical Jacobian of the linearization form for the coplanar constraint. Finally, the inertial measurement error, coplanar point photometric error, non-coplanar photometric error, and prior error are added into the optimizer, which simultaneously improves the pose estimation accuracy and mesh itself. We verified the performance of the whole system on simulation and real-world datasets. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our system outperforms the state-of-the-art counterparts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Active Collaborative Localization in Heterogeneous Robot Teams](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18193v1)** | 2023-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and robust state estimation is critical for autonomous navigation of robot teams. This task is especially challenging for large groups of size, weight, and power (SWAP) constrained aerial robots operating in perceptually-degraded GPS-denied environments. We can, however, actively increase the amount of perceptual information available to such robots by augmenting them with a small number of more expensive, but less resource-constrained, agents. Specifically, the latter can serve as sources of perceptual information themselves. In this paper, we study the problem of optimally positioning (and potentially navigating) a small number of more capable agents to enhance the perceptual environment for their lightweight,inexpensive, teammates that only need to rely on cameras and IMUs. We propose a numerically robust, computationally efficient approach to solve this problem via nonlinear optimization. Our method outperforms the standard approach based on the greedy algorithm, while matching the accuracy of a heuristic evolutionary scheme for global optimization at a fraction of its running time. Ultimately, we validate our solution in both photorealistic simulations and real-world experiments. In these experiments, we use lidar-based autonomous ground vehicles as the more capable agents, and vision-based aerial robots as their SWAP-constrained teammates. Our method is able to reduce drift in visual-inertial odometry by as much as 90%, and it outperforms random positioning of lidar-equipped agents by a significant margin. Furthermore, our method can be generalized to different types of robot teams with heterogeneous perception capabilities. It has a wide range of applications, such as surveying and mapping challenging dynamic environments, and enabling resilience to large-scale perturbations that can be caused by earthquakes or storms.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in Robotics: Science and Systems (RSS) 2023</p></details> |

Leveraging the proposed lightweight Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) for depth inference and encoding, we provide the network with previously marginalized sparse features from VIO to increase the accuracy of initial depth prediction and generalization capability. The compact encoded depth maps are then updated jointly with navigation states in a sliding window estimator in order to provide the dense local scene geometry. We additionally propose a novel method to obtain the CVAE's Jacobian which is shown to be more than an order of magnitude faster than previous works, and we additionally leverage First-Estimate Jacobian (FEJ) to avoid recalculation. As opposed to previous works relying on completely dense residuals, we propose to only provide sparse measurements to update the depth code and show through careful experimentation that our choice of sparse measurements and FEJs can still significantly improve the estimated depth maps. Our full system also exhibits state-of-the-art pose estimation accuracy, and we show that it can run in real-time with single-thread execution while utilizing GPU acceleration only for the network and code Jacobian.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICRA ...</summary><p>ICRA 2021; Best Paper Award in Robot Vision (Finalist)</p></details> |

The paradigm of a centralized architecture is well established, with the robots (i.e. agents) running Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) onboard while communicating relevant data, such as e.g. Keyframes (KFs), to a central back-end (i.e. server), which then merges and optimizes the joint maps of the agents. While these frameworks have proven to be successful, their capability and performance are highly dependent on the choice of the VIO front-end, thus limiting their flexibility. In this work, we present COVINS-G, a generalized back-end building upon the COVINS framework, enabling the compatibility of the server-back-end with any arbitrary VIO front-end, including, for example, off-the-shelf cameras with odometry capabilities, such as the Realsense T265. The COVINS-G back-end deploys a multi-camera relative pose estimation algorithm for computing the loop-closure constraints allowing the system to work purely on 2D image data. In the experimental evaluation, we show on-par accuracy with state-of-the-art multi-session and collaborative SLAM systems, while demonstrating the flexibility and generality of our approach by employing different front-ends onboard collaborating agents within the same mission. The COVINS-G codebase along with a generalized front-end wrapper to allow any existing VIO front-end to be readily used in combination with the proposed collaborative back-end is open-sourced.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach for VIO with stereo cameras which integrates and calibrates the velocity-control based kinematic motion model of wheeled mobile robots online. Including such a motion model can help to improve the accuracy of VIO. Compared to several previous approaches proposed to integrate wheel odometer measurements for this purpose, our method does not require wheel encoders and can be applied when the robot motion can be modeled with velocity-control based kinematic motion model. We use radial basis function (RBF) kernels to compensate for the time delay and deviations between control commands and actual robot motion. The motion model is calibrated online by the VIO system and can be used as a forward model for motion control and planning. We evaluate our approach with data obtained in variously sized indoor environments, demonstrate improvements over a pure VIO method, and evaluate the prediction accuracy of the online calibrated model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L) 2022</p></details> |

Underwater robots operating in a challenging environment are required to know their pose at all times. All vision-based localization schemes are prone to failure due to poor visibility conditions, color loss, and lack of features. The proposed approach utilizes a model of the robot's kinematics together with proprioceptive sensors to maintain the pose estimate during visual-inertial odometry (VIO) failures. Furthermore, the trajectories from successful VIO and the ones from the model-driven odometry are integrated in a coherent set that maintains a consistent pose at all times. Health-monitoring tracks the VIO process ensuring timely switches between the two estimators. Finally, loop closure is implemented on the overall trajectory. The resulting framework is a robust estimator switching between model-based and visual-inertial odometry (SM/VIO). Experimental results from numerous deployments of the Aqua2 vehicle demonstrate the robustness of our approach over coral reefs and a shipwreck.</p></details> |  |

| **[Transformation & Translation Occupancy Grid Mapping: 2-Dimensional Deep Learning Refined SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19654v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping) is a crucial component for robotic systems, providing a map of an environment, the current location and previous trajectory of a robot. While 3D LiDAR SLAM has received notable improvements in recent years, 2D SLAM lags behind. Gradual drifts in odometry and pose estimation inaccuracies hinder modern 2D LiDAR-odometry algorithms in large complex environments. Dynamic robotic motion coupled with inherent estimation based SLAM processes introduce noise and errors, degrading map quality. Occupancy Grid Mapping (OGM) produces results that are often noisy and unclear. This is due to the fact that evidence based mapping represents maps according to uncertain observations. This is why OGMs are so popular in exploration or navigation tasks. However, this also limits OGMs' effectiveness for specific mapping based tasks such as floor plan creation in complex scenes. To address this, we propose our novel Transformation and Translation Occupancy Grid Mapping (TT-OGM). We adapt and enable accurate and robust pose estimation techniques from 3D SLAM to the world of 2D and mitigate errors to improve map quality using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). We introduce a novel data generation method via deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to build datasets large enough for training a GAN for SLAM error correction. We demonstrate our SLAM in real-time on data collected at Loughborough University. We also prove its generalisability on a variety of large complex environments on a collection of large scale well-known 2D occupancy maps. Our novel approach enables the creation of high quality OGMs in complex scenes, far surpassing the capabilities of current SLAM algorithms in terms of quality, accuracy and reliability.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, preprint, submitted to Robotics And Autonomous Systems</p></details> |

Traditional SLAM approaches, which often rely on visual or LiDAR sensors, face significant challenges in adverse conditions such as low light or featureless environments. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel Doppler-aided radar-inertial and LiDAR-inertial SLAM framework that leverages the complementary strengths of 4D radar, FMCW LiDAR, and inertial measurement units. Our system integrates Doppler velocity measurements and spatial data into a tightly-coupled front-end and graph optimization back-end to provide enhanced ego velocity estimation, accurate odometry, and robust mapping. We also introduce a Doppler-based scan-matching technique to improve front-end odometry in dynamic environments. In addition, our framework incorporates an innovative online extrinsic calibration mechanism, utilizing Doppler velocity and loop closure to dynamically maintain sensor alignment. Extensive evaluations on both public and proprietary datasets show that our system significantly outperforms state-of-the-art radar-SLAM and LiDAR-SLAM frameworks in terms of accuracy and robustness. To encourage further research, the code of our Doppler-SLAM and our dataset are available at: https://github.com/Wayne-DWA/Doppler-SLAM.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |
| **[KISS-SLAM: A Simple, Robust, and Accurate 3D LiDAR SLAM System With Enhanced Generalization Capabilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12660v1)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust and accurate localization and mapping of an environment using laser scanners, so-called LiDAR SLAM, is essential to many robotic applications. Early 3D LiDAR SLAM methods often exploited additional information from IMU or GNSS sensors to enhance localization accuracy and mitigate drift. Later, advanced systems further improved the estimation at the cost of a higher runtime and complexity. This paper explores the limits of what can be achieved with a LiDAR-only SLAM approach while following the "Keep It Small and Simple" (KISS) principle. By leveraging this minimalistic design principle, our system, KISS-SLAM, archives state-of-the-art performances in pose accuracy while requiring little to no parameter tuning for deployment across diverse environments, sensors, and motion profiles. We follow best practices in graph-based SLAM and build upon LiDAR odometry to compute the relative motion between scans and construct local maps of the environment. To correct drift, we match local maps and optimize the trajectory in a pose graph optimization step. The experimental results demonstrate that this design achieves competitive performance while reducing complexity and reliance on additional sensor modalities. By prioritizing simplicity, this work provides a new strong baseline for LiDAR-only SLAM and a high-performing starting point for future research. Further, our pipeline builds consistent maps that can be used directly for further downstream tasks like navigation. Our open-source system operates faster than the sensor frame rate in all presented datasets and is designed for real-world scenarios.</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[Leveraging Semantic Graphs for Efficient and Robust LiDAR SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11145v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and robust simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is crucial for autonomous mobile systems, typically achieved by leveraging the geometric features of the environment. Incorporating semantics provides a richer scene representation that not only enhances localization accuracy in SLAM but also enables advanced cognitive functionalities for downstream navigation and planning tasks. Existing point-wise semantic LiDAR SLAM methods often suffer from poor efficiency and generalization, making them less robust in diverse real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a semantic graph-enhanced SLAM framework, named SG-SLAM, which effectively leverages the geometric, semantic, and topological characteristics inherent in environmental structures. The semantic graph serves as a fundamental component that facilitates critical functionalities of SLAM, including robust relocalization during odometry failures, accurate loop closing, and semantic graph map construction. Our method employs a dual-threaded architecture, with one thread dedicated to online odometry and relocalization, while the other handles loop closure, pose graph optimization, and map update. This design enables our method to operate in real time and generate globally consistent semantic graph maps and point cloud maps. We extensively evaluate our method across the KITTI, MulRAN, and Apollo datasets, and the results demonstrate its superiority compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our method has been released at https://github.com/nubot-nudt/SG-SLAM.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Task-driven SLAM Benchmarking For Robot Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16573v2)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A critical use case of SLAM for mobile assistive robots is to support localization during a navigation-based task. Current SLAM benchmarks overlook the significance of repeatability (precision), despite its importance in real-world deployments. To address this gap, we propose a task-driven approach to SLAM benchmarking, TaskSLAM-Bench. It employs precision as a key metric, accounts for SLAM's mapping capabilities, and has easy-to-meet implementation requirements. Simulated and real-world testing scenarios of SLAM methods provide insights into the navigation performance properties of modern visual and LiDAR SLAM solutions. The outcomes show that passive stereo SLAM operates at a level of precision comparable to LiDAR SLAM in typical indoor environments. TaskSLAM-Bench complements existing benchmarks and offers richer assessment of SLAM performance in navigation-focused scenarios. Publicly available code permits in-situ SLAM testing in custom environments with properly equipped robots.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 figures, 1 table.

| **[Online Tree Reconstruction and Forest Inventory on a Mobile Robotic System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17622v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) is the standard technique used to create accurate point clouds for digital forest inventories. However, the measurement process is demanding, requiring up to two days per hectare for data collection, significant data storage, as well as resource-heavy post-processing of 3D data. In this work, we present a real-time mapping and analysis system that enables online generation of forest inventories using mobile laser scanners that can be mounted e.g. on mobile robots. Given incrementally created and locally accurate submaps-data payloads-our approach extracts tree candidates using a custom, Voronoi-inspired clustering algorithm. Tree candidates are reconstructed using an adapted Hough algorithm, which enables robust modeling of the tree stem. Further, we explicitly incorporate the incremental nature of the data collection by consistently updating the database using a pose graph LiDAR SLAM system. This enables us to refine our estimates of the tree traits if an area is revisited later during a mission. We demonstrate competitive accuracy to TLS or manual measurements using laser scanners that we mounted on backpacks or mobile robots operating in conifer, broad-leaf and mixed forests. Our results achieve RMSE of 1.93 cm, a bias of 0.65 cm and a standard deviation of 1.81 cm (averaged across these sequences)-with no post-processing required after the mission is complete.</p></details> |  |
| **[Balancing Accuracy and Efficiency for Large-Scale SLAM: A Minimal Subset Approach for Scalable Loop Closures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01791v2)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Typical LiDAR SLAM architectures feature a front-end for odometry estimation and a back-end for refining and optimizing the trajectory and map, commonly through loop closures. However, loop closure detection in large-scale missions presents significant computational challenges due to the need to identify, verify, and process numerous candidate pairs for pose graph optimization. Keyframe sampling bridges the front-end and back-end by selecting frames for storing and processing during global optimization. This article proposes an online keyframe sampling approach that constructs the pose graph using the most impactful keyframes for loop closure. We introduce the Minimal Subset Approach (MSA), which optimizes two key objectives: redundancy minimization and information preservation, implemented within a sliding window framework. By operating in the feature space rather than 3-D space, MSA efficiently reduces redundant keyframes while retaining essential information. In sum, evaluations on diverse public datasets show that the proposed approach outperforms naive methods in reducing false positive rates in place recognition, while delivering superior ATE and RPE in metric localization, without the need for manual parameter tuning. Additionally, MSA demonstrates efficiency and scalability by reducing memory usage and computational overhead during loop closure detection and pose graph optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 Figures, 2 Tables.

| **[Anti-Degeneracy Scheme for Lidar SLAM based on Particle Filter in Geometry Feature-Less Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11486v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) based on particle filtering has been extensively employed in indoor scenarios due to its high efficiency. However, in geometry feature-less scenes, the accuracy is severely reduced due to lack of constraints. In this article, we propose an anti-degeneracy system based on deep learning. Firstly, we design a scale-invariant linear mapping to convert coordinates in continuous space into discrete indexes, in which a data augmentation method based on Gaussian model is proposed to ensure the model performance by effectively mitigating the impact of changes in the number of particles on the feature distribution. Secondly, we develop a degeneracy detection model using residual neural networks (ResNet) and transformer which is able to identify degeneracy by scrutinizing the distribution of the particle population. Thirdly, an adaptive anti-degeneracy strategy is designed, which first performs fusion and perturbation on the resample process to provide rich and accurate initial values for the pose optimization, and use a hierarchical pose optimization combining coarse and fine matching, which is able to adaptively adjust the optimization frequency and the sensor trustworthiness according to the degree of degeneracy, in order to enhance the ability of searching the global optimal pose. Finally, we demonstrate the optimality of the model, as well as the improvement of the image matrix method and GPU on the computation time through ablation experiments, and verify the performance of the anti-degeneracy system in different scenarios through simulation experiments and real experiments.

| **[SiLVR: Scalable Lidar-Visual Radiance Field Reconstruction with Uncertainty Quantification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02657v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a neural radiance field (NeRF) based large-scale reconstruction system that fuses lidar and vision data to generate high-quality reconstructions that are geometrically accurate and capture photorealistic texture. Our system adopts the state-of-the-art NeRF representation to additionally incorporate lidar. Adding lidar data adds strong geometric constraints on the depth and surface normals, which is particularly useful when modelling uniform texture surfaces which contain ambiguous visual reconstruction cues. Furthermore, we estimate the epistemic uncertainty of the reconstruction as the spatial variance of each point location in the radiance field given the sensor observations from camera and lidar. This enables the identification of areas that are reliably reconstructed by each sensor modality, allowing the map to be filtered according to the estimated uncertainty. Our system can also exploit the trajectory produced by a real-time pose-graph lidar SLAM system during online mapping to bootstrap a (post-processed) Structure-from-Motion (SfM) reconstruction procedure reducing SfM training time by up to 70%. It also helps to properly constrain the overall metric scale which is essential for the lidar depth loss. The globally-consistent trajectory can then be divided into submaps using Spectral Clustering to group sets of co-visible images together. This submapping approach is more suitable for visual reconstruction than distance-based partitioning. Each submap is filtered according to point-wise uncertainty estimates and merged to obtain the final large-scale 3D reconstruction. We demonstrate the reconstruction system using a multi-camera, lidar sensor suite in experiments involving both robot-mounted and handheld scanning. Our test datasets cover a total area of more than 20,000 square metres, including multiple university buildings and an aerial survey of a multi-storey.</p></details> | <details><summary>webpa...</summary><p>webpage: https://dynamic.robots.ox.ac.uk/projects/silvr/</p></details> |
| **[LiDAR Loop Closure Detection using Semantic Graphs with Graph Attention Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19382v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a novel loop closure detection algorithm that uses graph attention neural networks to encode semantic graphs to perform place recognition and then use semantic registration to estimate the 6 DoF relative pose constraint. Our place recognition algorithm has two key modules, namely, a semantic graph encoder module and a graph comparison module. The semantic graph encoder employs graph attention networks to efficiently encode spatial, semantic and geometric information from the semantic graph of the input point cloud. We then use self-attention mechanism in both node-embedding and graph-embedding steps to create distinctive graph vectors. The graph vectors of the current scan and a keyframe scan are then compared in the graph comparison module to identify a possible loop closure. Specifically, employing the difference of the two graph vectors showed a significant improvement in performance, as shown in ablation studies. Lastly, we implemented a semantic registration algorithm that takes in loop closure candidate scans and estimates the relative 6 DoF pose constraint for the LiDAR SLAM system. Extensive evaluation on public datasets shows that our model is more accurate and robust, achieving 13% improvement in maximum F1 score on the SemanticKITTI dataset, when compared to the baseline semantic graph algorithm. For the benefit of the community, we open-source the complete implementation of our proposed algorithm and custom implementation of semantic registration at https://github.com/crepuscularlight/SemanticLoopClosure</p></details> |  |
| **[Lifelong 3D Mapping Framework for Hand-held & Robot-mounted LiDAR Mapping Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18110v1)** | 2025-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a lifelong 3D mapping framework that is modular, cloud-native by design and more importantly, works for both hand-held and robot-mounted 3D LiDAR mapping systems. Our proposed framework comprises of dynamic point removal, multi-session map alignment, map change detection and map version control. First, our sensor-setup agnostic dynamic point removal algorithm works seamlessly with both hand-held and robot-mounted setups to produce clean static 3D maps. Second, the multi-session map alignment aligns these clean static maps automatically, without manual parameter fine-tuning, into a single reference frame, using a two stage approach based on feature descriptor matching and fine registration. Third, our novel map change detection identifies positive and negative changes between two aligned maps. Finally, the map version control maintains a single base map that represents the current state of the environment, and stores the detected positive and negative changes, and boundary information. Our unique map version control system can reconstruct any of the previous clean session maps and allows users to query changes between any two random mapping sessions, all without storing any input raw session maps, making it very unique. Extensive experiments are performed using hand-held commercial LiDAR mapping devices and open-source robot-mounted LiDAR SLAM algorithms to evaluate each module and the whole 3D lifelong mapping framework.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods often lacks adaptability to diverse scenarios, exhibits limited robustness in image-based approaches, and struggles with curved or complex geometries. To address these limitations, an innovative framework for two-dimensional (2D) crack detection, three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction, and 3D automatic crack measurement was proposed by integrating computer vision technologies and multi-modal Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) in this study. Firstly, building on a base DeepLabv3+ segmentation model, and incorporating specific refinements utilizing foundation model Segment Anything Model (SAM), we developed a crack segmentation method with strong generalization across unfamiliar scenarios, enabling the generation of precise 2D crack masks. To enhance the accuracy and robustness of 3D reconstruction, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) point clouds were utilized together with image data and segmentation masks. By leveraging both image- and LiDAR-SLAM, we developed a multi-frame and multi-modal fusion framework that produces dense, colorized point clouds, effectively capturing crack semantics at a 3D real-world scale. Furthermore, the crack geometric attributions were measured automatically and directly within 3D dense point cloud space, surpassing the limitations of conventional 2D image-based measurements. This advancement makes the method suitable for structural components with curved and complex 3D geometries. Experimental results across various concrete structures highlight the significant improvements and unique advantages of the proposed method, demonstrating its effectiveness, accuracy, and robustness in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

However, even in modern SLAM solutions, ICP can degrade and become unreliable in geometrically ill-conditioned environments. Current solutions primarily focus on utilizing additional sources of information, such as external odometry, to either replace the degenerate directions of the optimization solution or add additional constraints in a sensor-fusion setup afterward. In response, this work investigates and compares new and existing degeneracy mitigation methods for robust LiDAR-based localization and analyzes the efficacy of these approaches in degenerate environments for the first time in the literature at this scale. Specifically, this work investigates i) the effect of using active or passive degeneracy mitigation methods for the problem of ill-conditioned ICP in LiDAR degenerate environments, ii) the evaluation of TSVD, inequality constraints, and linear/non-linear Tikhonov regularization for the application of degenerate point cloud registration for the first time. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis for least-squares minimization step of the ICP problem is carried out to better understand how each method affects the optimization and what to expect from each method. The results of the analysis are validated through multiple real-world robotic field and simulated experiments. The analysis demonstrates that active optimization degeneracy mitigation is necessary and advantageous in the absence of reliable external estimate assistance for LiDAR-SLAM, and soft-constrained methods can provide better results in complex ill-conditioned scenarios with heuristic fine-tuned parameters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Field Robotics</p></details> |

However, off-the-shelf LiDAR-based SLAM methods suffer from significant pose estimation drifts, particularly components relevant to the vertical direction, when passing to uneven terrains. This deficiency typically leads to a conspicuously distorted global map. In this article, a LiDAR-based SLAM method is presented to improve the accuracy of pose estimations for ground vehicles in rough terrains, which is termed Rotation-Optimized LiDAR-Only (ROLO) SLAM. The method exploits a forward location prediction to coarsely eliminate the location difference of consecutive scans, thereby enabling separate and accurate determination of the location and orientation at the front-end. Furthermore, we adopt a parallel-capable spatial voxelization for correspondence-matching. We develop a spherical alignment-guided rotation registration within each voxel to estimate the rotation of vehicle. By incorporating geometric alignment, we introduce the motion constraint into the optimization formulation to enhance the rapid and effective estimation of LiDAR's translation. Subsequently, we extract several keyframes to construct the submap and exploit an alignment from the current scan to the submap for precise pose estimation. Meanwhile, a global-scale factor graph is established to aid in the reduction of cumulative errors. In various scenes, diverse experiments have been conducted to evaluate our method. The results demonstrate that ROLO-SLAM excels in pose estimation of ground vehicles and outperforms existing state-of-the-art LiDAR SLAM frameworks.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This article has been accepted by Journal of Field Robotics</p></details> |

One key contribution of this work to 3D LiDAR SLAM and localization is a fierce defense of view-based maps (pose graphs with time-stamped sensor readings) as the fundamental representation of maps. As will be shown, they allow for the greatest flexibility, enabling the posterior generation of arbitrary metric maps optimized for particular tasks, e.g. obstacle avoidance, real-time localization. Moreover, this work introduces a new framework in which mapping pipelines can be defined without coding, defining the connections of a network of reusable blocks much like deep-learning networks are designed by connecting layers of standardized elements. We also introduce tightly-coupled estimation of linear and angular velocity vectors within the Iterative Closest Point (ICP)-like optimizer, leading to superior robustness against aggressive motion profiles without the need for an IMU. Extensive experimental validation reveals that the proposal compares well to, or improves, former state-of-the-art (SOTA) LiDAR odometry systems, while also successfully mapping some hard sequences where others diverge. A proposed self-adaptive configuration has been used, without parameter changes, for all 3D LiDAR datasets with sensors between 16 and 128 rings, and has been extensively tested on 83 sequences over more than 250~km of automotive, hand-held, airborne, and quadruped LiDAR datasets, both indoors and outdoors. The system flexibility is demonstrated with additional configurations for 2D LiDARs and for building 3D NDT-like maps.

| **[Selective Kalman Filter: When and How to Fuse Multi-Sensor Information to Overcome Degeneracy in SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17235v1)** | 2024-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Research trends in SLAM systems are now focusing more on multi-sensor fusion to handle challenging and degenerative environments. However, most existing multi-sensor fusion SLAM methods mainly use all of the data from a range of sensors, a strategy we refer to as the all-in method. This method, while merging the benefits of different sensors, also brings in their weaknesses, lowering the robustness and accuracy and leading to high computational demands. To address this, we propose a new fusion approach -- Selective Kalman Filter -- to carefully choose and fuse information from multiple sensors (using LiDAR and visual observations as examples in this paper). For deciding when to fuse data, we implement degeneracy detection in LiDAR SLAM, incorporating visual measurements only when LiDAR SLAM exhibits degeneracy. Regarding degeneracy detection, we propose an elegant yet straightforward approach to determine the degeneracy of LiDAR SLAM and to identify the specific degenerative direction. This method fully considers the coupled relationship between rotational and translational constraints. In terms of how to fuse data, we use visual measurements only to update the specific degenerative states. As a result, our proposed method improves upon the all-in method by greatly enhancing real-time performance due to less processing visual data, and it introduces fewer errors from visual measurements. Experiments demonstrate that our method for degeneracy detection and fusion, in addressing degeneracy issues, exhibits higher precision and robustness compared to other state-of-the-art methods, and offers enhanced real-time performance relative to the all-in method. The code is openly available.</p></details> |  |

The LiDAR odometry is of great importance in multi-sensor fusion. However, in some unstructured environments, the point cloud registration cannot constrain the poses of the LiDAR due to its sparse geometric features, which leads to the degeneracy of multi-sensor fusion accuracy. To address this problem, we propose a novel real-time approach to sense and compensate for the degeneracy of LiDAR. Firstly, this paper introduces the degeneracy factor with clear meaning, which can measure the degeneracy of LiDAR. Then, the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) clustering method adaptively perceives the degeneracy with better environmental generalization. Finally, the degeneracy perception results are utilized to fuse LiDAR and IMU, thus effectively resisting degeneracy effects. Experiments on our dataset show the method's high accuracy and robustness and validate our algorithm's adaptability to different environments and LiDAR scanning modalities.</p></details> | 13 pages |

Solutions to SLAM and MOT usually rely on certain assumptions, such as the static environment assumption for SLAM and the accurate ego-vehicle pose assumption for MOT. But in complex dynamic environments, it is difficult or even impossible to meet these assumptions. Therefore, the SLAMMOT, i.e., simultaneous localization, mapping, and moving object tracking, integrated system of SLAM and object tracking, has emerged for autonomous vehicles in dynamic environments. However, many conventional SLAMMOT solutions directly perform data association on the predictions and detections for object tracking, but ignore their quality. In practice, inaccurate predictions caused by continuous multi-frame missed detections in temporary occlusion scenarios, may degrade the performance of tracking, thereby affecting SLAMMOT. To address this challenge, this paper presents a LiDAR SLAMMOT based on confidence-guided data association (Conf SLAMMOT) method, which tightly couples the LiDAR SLAM and the confidence-guided data association based multi-object tracking into a graph optimization backend for estimating the state of the ego-vehicle and objects simultaneously. The confidence of prediction and detection are applied in the factor graph-based multi-object tracking for its data association, which not only avoids the performance degradation caused by incorrect initial assignments in some filter-based methods but also handles issues such as continuous missed detection in tracking while also improving the overall performance of SLAMMOT. Various comparative experiments demonstrate the superior advantages of Conf SLAMMOT, especially in scenes with some missed detections.</p></details> |  |

The first step determines whether loop closing should be performed, while the second estimates the 6-DoF pose to correct odometry drift. Current methods mostly focus on developing robust descriptors for loop closure detection, often neglecting loop pose estimation. A few methods that do include pose estimation either suffer from low accuracy or incur high computational costs. To tackle this problem, we introduce SGLC, a real-time semantic graph-guided full loop closing method, with robust loop closure detection and 6-DoF pose estimation capabilities. SGLC takes into account the distinct characteristics of foreground and background points. For foreground instances, it builds a semantic graph that not only abstracts point cloud representation for fast descriptor generation and matching but also guides the subsequent loop verification and initial pose estimation. Background points, meanwhile, are exploited to provide more geometric features for scan-wise descriptor construction and stable planar information for further pose refinement. Loop pose estimation employs a \mbox{coarse-fine-refine} registration scheme that considers the alignment of both instance points and background points, offering high efficiency and accuracy. Extensive experiments on multiple publicly available datasets demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we integrate SGLC into a SLAM system, eliminating accumulated errors and improving overall SLAM performance. The implementation of SGLC will be released at https://github.com/nubot-nudt/SGLC.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

However, for long duration missions, existing works that either operate directly the full pointclouds or on extracted features face key tradeoffs in accuracy and computational efficiency (e.g., memory consumption). To address these issues, this paper presents DFLIOM with several key innovations. Unlike previous methods that rely on handcrafted heuristics and hand-tuned parameters for feature extraction, we propose a learning-based approach that select points relevant to LiDAR SLAM pointcloud registration. Furthermore, we extend our prior work DLIOM with the learned feature extractor and observe our method enables similar or even better localization performance using only about 20\% of the points in the dense point clouds. We demonstrate that DFLIOM performs well on multiple public benchmarks, achieving a 2.4\% decrease in localization error and 57.5\% decrease in memory usage compared to state-of-the-art methods (DLIOM). Although extracting features with the proposed network requires extra time, it is offset by the faster processing time downstream, thus maintaining real-time performance using 20Hz LiDAR on our hardware setup. The effectiveness of our learning-based feature extraction module is further demonstrated through comparison with several handcrafted feature extractors.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |

Current SLAM systems can achieve centimeter-level accuracy within a short period. However, there are still several challenges when dealing with largescale mapping tasks including significant storage requirements and difficulty of reusing the constructed maps. To address this, we first design an elastic and lightweight map representation called CELLmap, composed of several CELLs, each representing the local map at the corresponding location. Then, we design a general backend including CELL-based bidirectional registration module and loop closure detection module to improve global map consistency. Our experiments have demonstrated that CELLmap can represent the precise geometric structure of large-scale maps of KITTI dataset using only about 60 MB. Additionally, our general backend achieves up to a 26.88% improvement over various LiDAR odometry methods.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |

In this paper, we propose a SLAM system for building globally consistent maps, called PIN-SLAM, that is based on an elastic and compact point-based implicit neural map representation. Taking range measurements as input, our approach alternates between incremental learning of the local implicit signed distance field and the pose estimation given the current local map using a correspondence-free, point-to-implicit model registration. Our implicit map is based on sparse optimizable neural points, which are inherently elastic and deformable with the global pose adjustment when closing a loop. Loops are also detected using the neural point features. Extensive experiments validate that PIN-SLAM is robust to various environments and versatile to different range sensors such as LiDAR and RGB-D cameras. PIN-SLAM achieves pose estimation accuracy better or on par with the state-of-the-art LiDAR odometry or SLAM systems and outperforms the recent neural implicit SLAM approaches while maintaining a more consistent, and highly compact implicit map that can be reconstructed as accurate and complete meshes. Finally, thanks to the voxel hashing for efficient neural points indexing and the fast implicit map-based registration without closest point association, PIN-SLAM can run at the sensor frame rate on a moderate GPU. Codes will be available at: https://github.com/PRBonn/PIN_SLAM.</p></details> | 20 pages |

However, the utilization of 2D LiDAR in Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) frequently encounters challenges related to motion degeneracy, particularly in geometrically similar environments. To address this problem, this paper proposes a robust, accurate, and multi-sensor-fused 2D LiDAR SLAM system specifically designed for indoor mobile robots. To commence, the original LiDAR data undergoes meticulous processing through point and line extraction. Leveraging the distinctive characteristics of indoor environments, line-line constraints are established to complement other sensor data effectively, thereby augmenting the overall robustness and precision of the system. Concurrently, a tightly-coupled front-end is created, integrating data from the 2D LiDAR, IMU, and wheel odometry, thus enabling real-time state estimation. Building upon this solid foundation, a novel global feature point matching-based loop closure detection algorithm is proposed. This algorithm proves highly effective in mitigating front-end accumulated errors and ultimately constructs a globally consistent map. The experimental results indicate that our system fully meets real-time requirements. When compared to Cartographer, our system not only exhibits lower trajectory errors but also demonstrates stronger robustness, particularly in degeneracy problem.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by Measurement Science and Technology: https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6501/ad3ea3/meta</p></details> |

This paper explores the application of SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) technology in the context of automatic lane change behavior prediction and environment perception for autonomous vehicles. It discusses the limitations of traditional positioning methods, introduces SLAM technology, and compares LIDAR SLAM with visual SLAM. Real-world examples from companies like Tesla, Waymo, and Mobileye showcase the integration of AI-driven technologies, sensor fusion, and SLAM in autonomous driving systems.

Existing implicit mapping methods for LiDAR show promising results in large-scale reconstruction, but either require groundtruth poses or run slower than real-time. In contrast, LONER uses LiDAR data to train an MLP to estimate a dense map in real-time, while simultaneously estimating the trajectory of the sensor. To achieve real-time performance, this paper proposes a novel information-theoretic loss function that accounts for the fact that different regions of the map may be learned to varying degrees throughout online training. The proposed method is evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively on two open-source datasets. This evaluation illustrates that the proposed loss function converges faster and leads to more accurate geometry reconstruction than other loss functions used in depth-supervised neural implicit frameworks. Finally, this paper shows that LONER estimates trajectories competitively with state-of-the-art LiDAR SLAM methods, while also producing dense maps competitive with existing real-time implicit mapping methods that use groundtruth poses.</p></details> | <details><summary>First...</summary><p>First two authors equally contributed.

This paper proposes an out-of-the-box NDT (Normal Distribution Transform) based global descriptor, NDT-Map-Code, designed for both on-road driving and underground valet parking scenarios. NDT-Map-Code can be directly extracted from the NDT map without the need for a dense point cloud, resulting in excellent scalability and low maintenance cost. The NDT representation is leveraged to identify representative patterns, which are further encoded according to their spatial location (bearing, range, and height). Experimental results on the NIO underground parking lot dataset and the KITTI dataset demonstrate that our method achieves significantly better performance compared to the state-of-the-art.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

It then grew to implement Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) on various robots and mobile platforms. As each application brings its own set of contraints on sensors, processing capabilities and locomotion, it raises the question of which SLAM approach is the most appropriate to use in terms of cost, accuracy, computation power and ease of integration. Since most of SLAM approaches are either visual or lidar-based, comparison is difficult. Therefore, we decided to extend RTAB-Map to support both visual and lidar SLAM, providing in one package a tool allowing users to implement and compare a variety of 3D and 2D solutions for a wide range of applications with different robots and sensors. This paper presents this extended version of RTAB-Map and its use in comparing, both quantitatively and qualitatively, a large selection of popular real-world datasets (e.g., KITTI, EuRoC, TUM RGB-D, MIT Stata Center on PR2 robot), outlining strengths and limitations of visual and lidar SLAM configurations from a practical perspective for autonomous navigation applications.</p></details> | 40 pages, 19 figures |

| **[Quatro++: Robust Global Registration Exploiting Ground Segmentation for Loop Closing in LiDAR SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00928v2)** | 2024-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Global registration is a fundamental task that estimates the relative pose between two viewpoints of 3D point clouds. However, there are two issues that degrade the performance of global registration in LiDAR SLAM: one is the sparsity issue and the other is degeneracy. The sparsity issue is caused by the sparse characteristics of the 3D point cloud measurements in a mechanically spinning LiDAR sensor. The degeneracy issue sometimes occurs because the outlier-rejection methods reject too many correspondences, leaving less than three inliers. These two issues have become more severe as the pose discrepancy between the two viewpoints of 3D point clouds becomes greater. To tackle these problems, we propose a robust global registration framework, called \textit{Quatro++}. Extending our previous work that solely focused on the global registration itself, we address the robust global registration in terms of the loop closing in LiDAR SLAM. To this end, ground segmentation is exploited to achieve robust global registration. Through the experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed method shows a higher success rate than the state-of-the-art global registration methods, overcoming the sparsity and degeneracy issues. In addition, we show that ground segmentation significantly helps to increase the success rate for the ground vehicles. Finally, we apply our proposed method to the loop closing module in LiDAR SLAM and confirm that the quality of the loop constraints is improved, showing more precise mapping results. Therefore, the experimental evidence corroborated the suitability of our method as an initial alignment in the loop closing.

Many extension works on LOAM mainly leverage one specific constraint to improve the performance, e.g., information from on-board sensors such as loop closure and inertial state; prior conditions such as ground level and motion dynamics. In many robotic applications, these conditions are often known partially, hence a SLAM system can be a comprehensive problem due to the existence of numerous constraints. Therefore, we can achieve a better SLAM result by fusing them properly. In this paper, we propose a hybrid LiDAR-inertial SLAM framework that leverages both the on-board perception system and prior information such as motion dynamics to improve localization performance. In particular, we consider the case for ground vehicles, which are commonly used for autonomous driving and warehouse logistics. We present a computationally efficient LiDAR-inertial odometry method that directly parameterizes ground vehicle poses on SE(2). The out-of-SE(2) motion perturbations are not neglected but incorporated into an integrated noise term of a novel SE(2)-constraints model. For odometric measurement processing, we propose a versatile, tightly coupled LiDAR-inertial odometry to achieve better pose estimation than traditional LiDAR odometry. Thorough experiments are performed to evaluate our proposed method's performance in different scenarios, including localization for both indoor and outdoor environments. The proposed method achieves superior performance in accuracy and robustness.</p></details> |  |

We utilize neural network to extract highly representative and sparse neural descriptors from point clouds, enabling memory-efficient map representation and accurate multi-scale localization tasks (e.g., odometry and loop-closure). Moreover, we showcase the versatility of our framework by extending it to more challenging multi-agent collaborative SLAM.

This article begins by formulating loop closing and relocalization within a unified framework. Then, we propose a novel multi-head network LCR-Net to tackle both tasks effectively. It exploits novel feature extraction and pose-aware attention mechanism to precisely estimate similarities and 6-DoF poses between pairs of LiDAR scans. In the end, we integrate our LCR-Net into a SLAM system and achieve robust and accurate online LiDAR SLAM in outdoor driving environments. We thoroughly evaluate our LCR-Net through three setups derived from loop closing and relocalization, including candidate retrieval, closed-loop point cloud registration, and continuous relocalization using multiple datasets. The results demonstrate that LCR-Net excels in all three tasks, surpassing the state-of-the-art methods and exhibiting a remarkable generalization ability. Notably, our LCR-Net outperforms baseline methods without using a time-consuming robust pose estimator, rendering it suitable for online SLAM applications.

This new capability is beneficial for perceptions in various use cases, but it is challenging for resource-constrained mobile devices to use the perceptions in real-time because of their high computational complexity. In this context, edge computing can be used to enable LiDAR online perceptions, but offloading the perceptions on the edge server requires a low-latency, lightweight, and efficient compression due to the large volume of LiDAR point clouds data. This paper presents FLiCR, a fast and lightweight LiDAR point cloud compression method for enabling edge-assisted online perceptions. FLiCR is based on range images (RI) as an intermediate representation (IR), and dictionary coding for compressing RIs. FLiCR achieves its benefits by leveraging lossy RIs, and we show the efficiency of bytestream compression is largely improved with quantization and subsampling. In addition, we identify the limitation of current quality metrics for presenting the entropy of a point cloud, and introduce a new metric that reflects both point-wise and entropy-wise qualities for lossy IRs. The evaluation results show FLiCR is more suitable for edge-assisted real-time perceptions than the existing LiDAR compressions, and we demonstrate the effectiveness of our compression and metric with the evaluations on 3D object detection and LiDAR SLAM.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 11 figures, conference paper</p></details> |

But the LiDAR-SLAM could be disturbed by current scene moving objects, resulting in drift errors and even loop-closure failure. Thus, the ability to detect and segment moving objects is essential for high-precision positioning and building a consistent map. In this paper, we address the problem of moving object segmentation from 3D LiDAR scans to improve the odometry and loop-closure accuracy of SLAM. We propose a novel 3D Sequential Moving-Object-Segmentation (3D-SeqMOS) method that can accurately segment the scene into moving and static objects, such as moving and static cars. Different from the existing projected-image method, we process the raw 3D point cloud and build a 3D convolution neural network for MOS task. In addition, to make full use of the spatio-temporal information of point cloud, we propose a point cloud residual mechanism using the spatial features of current scan and the temporal features of previous residual scans. Besides, we build a complete SLAM framework to verify the effectiveness and accuracy of 3D-SeqMOS. Experiments on SemanticKITTI dataset show that our proposed 3D-SeqMOS method can effectively detect moving objects and improve the accuracy of LiDAR odometry and loop-closure detection. The test results show our 3D-SeqMOS outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 12.4%. We extend the proposed method to the SemanticKITTI: Moving Object Segmentation competition and achieve the 2nd in the leaderboard, showing its effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

However, it faces many challenges in real-world scenarios, such as the prior information about the environment being absent and poor communication among the team members. This work presents DCL-SLAM, a fully distributed collaborative LiDAR SLAM framework intended for the robotic swarm to simultaneously co-localize in an unknown environment with minimal information exchange. Based on ad-hoc wireless peer-to-peer communication (limited bandwidth and communication range), DCL-SLAM adopts the lightweight LiDAR-Iris descriptor for place recognition and does not require full connectivity among teams. DCL-SLAM includes three main parts: a replaceable single-robot front-end that produces LiDAR odometry results; a distributed loop closure module that detects inter-robot loop closures with keyframes; and a distributed back-end module that adapts distributed pose graph optimizer combined with a pairwise consistent measurement set maximization algorithm to reject spurious inter-robot loop closures. We integrate our proposed framework with diverse open-source LiDAR odometry methods to show its versatility. The proposed system is extensively evaluated on benchmarking datasets and field experiments over various scales and environments.

| **[Marker-based Visual SLAM leveraging Hierarchical Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01155v2)** | 2023-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fiducial markers can encode rich information about the environment and can aid Visual SLAM (VSLAM) approaches in reconstructing maps with practical semantic information. Current marker-based VSLAM approaches mainly utilize markers for improving feature detections in low-feature environments and/or for incorporating loop closure constraints, generating only low-level geometric maps of the environment prone to inaccuracies in complex environments. To bridge this gap, this paper presents a VSLAM approach utilizing a monocular camera along with fiducial markers to generate hierarchical representations of the environment while improving the camera pose estimate. The proposed approach detects semantic entities from the surroundings, including walls, corridors, and rooms encoded within markers, and appropriately adds topological constraints among them. Experimental results on a real-world dataset collected with a robot demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms a traditional marker-based VSLAM baseline in terms of accuracy, given the addition of new constraints while creating enhanced map representations. Furthermore, it shows satisfactory results when comparing the reconstructed map quality to the one reconstructed using a LiDAR SLAM approach.</p></details> | 7 pages, 6 figures |

Inspired by the need for real-life deployment of autonomous robots in such environments, this article presents an experimental comparative study of 3D SLAM algorithms. The study focuses on state-of-the-art Lidar SLAM algorithms with open-source implementation that are i) lidar-only like BLAM, LOAM, A-LOAM, ISC-LOAM and hdl graph slam, or ii) lidar-inertial like LeGO-LOAM, Cartographer, LIO-mapping and LIO-SAM. The evaluation of the methods is performed based on a dataset collected from the Boston Dynamics Spot robot equipped with 3D lidar Velodyne Puck Lite and IMU Vectornav VN-100, during a mission in an underground tunnel. In the evaluation process poses and 3D tunnel reconstructions from SLAM algorithms are compared against each other to find methods with most solid performance in terms of pose accuracy and map quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables, \c{opyright} 2022 the authors.

Dense maps are essential for robotic applications, such as map-based navigation. Due to the low memory cost, mesh has become an attractive dense model for mapping in recent years. However, existing methods usually produce mesh maps by using an offline post-processing step to generate mesh maps. This two-step pipeline does not allow these methods to use the built mesh maps online and to enable localization and meshing to benefit each other. To solve this problem, we propose the first CPU-only real-time LiDAR SLAM system that can simultaneously build a mesh map and perform localization against the mesh map. A novel and direct meshing strategy with Gaussian process reconstruction realizes the fast building, registration, and updating of mesh maps. We perform experiments on several public datasets. The results show that our SLAM system can run at around $40$Hz. The localization and meshing accuracy also outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, including the TSDF map and Poisson reconstruction.

In this work, we have developed an improved LiDAR-inertial localization and mapping system for unmanned ground vehicles, which is appropriate for versatile search and rescue applications. Compared with existing LiDAR-based localization and mapping systems such as LOAM, we have two major contributions: the first is the improvement of the robustness of particle swarm filter-based LiDAR SLAM, while the second is the loop closure methods developed for global optimization to improve the localization accuracy of the whole system. We demonstrate by experiments that the accuracy and robustness of the LiDAR SLAM system are both improved. Finally, we have done systematic experimental tests at the Hong Kong science park as well as other indoor or outdoor real complicated testing circumstances, which demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach. It is demonstrated that our system has high accuracy, robustness, as well as efficiency. Our system is of great importance to the localization and mapping of the unmanned ground vehicle in an unknown environment.</p></details> | ICCA 2022 (Oral) |
| **[An Integrated LiDAR-SLAM System for Complex Environment with Noisy Point Clouds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05705v1)** | 2022-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The current LiDAR SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) system suffers greatly from low accuracy and limited robustness when faced with complicated circumstances. From our experiments, we find that current LiDAR SLAM systems have limited performance when the noise level in the obtained point clouds is large. Therefore, in this work, we propose a general framework to tackle the problem of denoising and loop closure for LiDAR SLAM in complex environments with many noises and outliers caused by reflective materials. Current approaches for point clouds denoising are mainly designed for small-scale point clouds and can not be extended to large-scale point clouds scenes. In this work, we firstly proposed a lightweight network for large-scale point clouds denoising. Subsequently, we have also designed an efficient loop closure network for place recognition in global optimization to improve the localization accuracy of the whole system. Finally, we have demonstrated by extensive experiments and benchmark studies that our method can have a significant boost on the localization accuracy of the LiDAR SLAM system when faced with noisy point clouds, with a marginal increase in computational cost.</p></details> | IROS 2022 |

The solutions to these problems are generally based on their respective assumptions, \ie{the static world assumption for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and the accurate ego-pose assumption for object tracking}. However, these assumptions are challenging to hold in dynamic road scenarios, where SLAM and object tracking become closely correlated. Therefore, we propose DL-SLOT, a dynamic LiDAR SLAM and object tracking method, to simultaneously address these two coupled problems. This method integrates the state estimations of both the autonomous vehicle and the stationary and dynamic objects in the environment into a unified optimization framework. First, we used object detection to identify all points belonging to potentially dynamic objects. Subsequently, a LiDAR odometry was conducted using the filtered point cloud. Simultaneously, we proposed a sliding window-based object association method that accurately associates objects according to the historical trajectories of tracked objects. The ego-states and those of the stationary and dynamic objects are integrated into the sliding window-based collaborative graph optimization. The stationary objects are subsequently restored from the potentially dynamic object set. Finally, a global pose-graph is implemented to eliminate the accumulated error. Experiments on KITTI datasets demonstrate that our method achieves better accuracy than SLAM and object tracking baseline methods. This confirms that solving SLAM and object tracking simultaneously is mutually advantageous, dramatically improving the robustness and accuracy of SLAM and object tracking in dynamic road scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 10 figures, this work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[BoW3D: Bag of Words for Real-Time Loop Closing in 3D LiDAR SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07473v2)** | 2022-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Loop closing is a fundamental part of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) for autonomous mobile systems. In the field of visual SLAM, bag of words (BoW) has achieved great success in loop closure. The BoW features for loop searching can also be used in the subsequent 6-DoF loop correction. However, for 3D LiDAR SLAM, the state-of-the-art methods may fail to effectively recognize the loop in real time, and usually cannot correct the full 6-DoF loop pose. To address this limitation, we present a novel Bag of Words for real-time loop closing in 3D LiDAR SLAM, called BoW3D. Our method not only efficiently recognizes the revisited loop places, but also corrects the full 6-DoF loop pose in real time. BoW3D builds the bag of words based on the 3D LiDAR feature LinK3D, which is efficient, pose-invariant and can be used for accurate point-to-point matching. We furthermore embed our proposed method into 3D LiDAR odometry system to evaluate loop closing performance. We test our method on public dataset, and compare it against other state-of-the-art algorithms. BoW3D shows better performance in terms of F1 max and extended precision scores on most scenarios. It is noticeable that BoW3D takes an average of 48 ms to recognize and correct the loops on KITTI 00 (includes 4K+ 64-ray LiDAR scans), when executed on a notebook with an Intel Core i7 @2.2 GHz processor. We release the implementation of our method here: https://github.com/YungeCui/BoW3D.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)/ICRA 2023</p></details> |

This is in part owing to the high-accuracy of robust SLAM algorithms and the emergence of new and lower-cost lidar products. This study benchmarks current state-of-the-art lidar SLAM algorithms with a multi-modal lidar sensor setup showcasing diverse scanning modalities (spinning and solid-state) and sensing technologies, and lidar cameras, mounted on a mobile sensing and computing platform. We extend our previous multi-modal multi-lidar dataset with additional sequences and new sources of ground truth data. Specifically, we propose a new multi-modal multi-lidar SLAM-assisted and ICP-based sensor fusion method for generating ground truth maps. With these maps, we then match real-time pointcloud data using a natural distribution transform (NDT) method to obtain the ground truth with full 6 DOF pose estimation. This novel ground truth data leverages high-resolution spinning and solid-state lidars. We also include new open road sequences with GNSS-RTK data and additional indoor sequences with motion capture (MOCAP) ground truth, complementing the previous forest sequences with MOCAP data. We perform an analysis of the positioning accuracy achieved with ten different SLAM algorithm and lidar combinations. We also report the resource utilization in four different computational platforms and a total of five settings (Intel and Jetson ARM CPUs). Our experimental results show that current state-of-the-art lidar SLAM algorithms perform very differently for different types of sensors.

| **[PlaneSLAM: Plane-based LiDAR SLAM for Motion Planning in Structured 3D Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08248v2)** | 2022-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR sensors are a powerful tool for robot simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) in unknown environments, but the raw point clouds they produce are dense, computationally expensive to store, and unsuited for direct use by downstream autonomy tasks, such as motion planning. For integration with motion planning, it is desirable for SLAM pipelines to generate lightweight geometric map representations. Such representations are also particularly well-suited for man-made environments, which can often be viewed as a so-called "Manhattan world" built on a Cartesian grid. In this work we present a 3D LiDAR SLAM algorithm for Manhattan world environments which extracts planar features from point clouds to achieve lightweight, real-time localization and mapping. Our approach generates plane-based maps which occupy significantly less memory than their point cloud equivalents, and are suited towards fast collision checking for motion planning. By leveraging the Manhattan world assumption, we target extraction of orthogonal planes to generate maps which are more structured and organized than those of existing plane-based LiDAR SLAM approaches. We demonstrate our approach in the high-fidelity AirSim simulator and in real-world experiments with a ground rover equipped with a Velodyne LiDAR. For both cases, we are able to generate high quality maps and trajectory estimates at a rate matching the sensor rate of 10 Hz.</p></details> |  |
| **[LMBAO: A Landmark Map for Bundle Adjustment Odometry in LiDAR SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08810v1)** | 2022-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR odometry is one of the essential parts of LiDAR simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). However, existing LiDAR odometry tends to match a new scan simply iteratively with previous fixed-pose scans, gradually accumulating errors. Furthermore, as an effective joint optimization mechanism, bundle adjustment (BA) cannot be directly introduced into real-time odometry due to the intensive computation of large-scale global landmarks. Therefore, this letter designs a new strategy named a landmark map for bundle adjustment odometry (LMBAO) in LiDAR SLAM to solve these problems. First, BA-based odometry is further developed with an active landmark maintenance strategy for a more accurate local registration and avoiding cumulative errors. Specifically, this paper keeps entire stable landmarks on the map instead of just their feature points in the sliding window and deletes the landmarks according to their active grade. Next, the sliding window length is reduced, and marginalization is performed to retain the scans outside the window but corresponding to active landmarks on the map, greatly simplifying the computation and improving the real-time properties. In addition, experiments on three challenging datasets show that our algorithm achieves real-time performance in outdoor driving and outperforms state-of-the-art LiDAR SLAM algorithms, including Lego-LOAM and VLOM.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 tables, 6 figures</p></details> |

While most of these SLAM systems use Visual and LiDAR sensors in tandem with an odometry sensor, these odometry sensors drift over time. To combat this drift, Visual SLAM systems deploy compute and memory intensive search algorithms to detect `Loop Closures', which make the trajectory estimate globally consistent. To circumvent these resource (compute and memory) intensive algorithms, we present ViWiD, which integrates WiFi and Visual sensors in a dual-layered system. This dual-layered approach separates the tasks of local and global trajectory estimation making ViWiD resource efficient while achieving on-par or better performance to state-of-the-art Visual SLAM. We demonstrate ViWiD's performance on four datasets, covering over 1500 m of traversed path and show 4.3x and 4x reduction in compute and memory consumption respectively compared to state-of-the-art Visual and Lidar SLAM systems with on par SLAM performance.</p></details> |  |

We propose a scheme that fuses map prior and vanishing points from images, which can establish an energy term that is only constrained on rotation, called the direction projection error. Then we embed these direction priors into a visual-LiDAR SLAM system that integrates camera and LiDAR measurements in a tightly-coupled way at backend. Specifically, our method generates visual reprojection error and point to Implicit Moving Least Square(IMLS) surface of scan constraints, and solves them jointly along with direction projection error at global optimization. Experiments on KITTI, KITTI-360 and Oxford Radar Robotcar show that we achieve lower localization error or Absolute Pose Error (APE) than prior map, which validates our method is effective.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages (including supplementary material), accepted by PRCV 2022</p></details> |

Fusing data from landmark sensors and a strap-down Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) in an adaptive Kalman filter (KF) plus the observability of the system are investigated. In addition to the vehicle's states and landmark positions, a self-tuning filter estimates the IMU calibration parameters as well as the covariance of the measurement noise. The discrete-time covariance matrix of the process noise, the state transition matrix, and the observation sensitivity matrix are derived in closed-form making them suitable for real-time implementation. Examining the observability of the 3D SLAM system leads to the conclusion that the system remains observable upon a geometrical condition on the alignment of the landmarks.</p></details> |  |

Etna, Sicily, an environment analogous to the Moon and Mars, using a hand-held sensor suite with attributes suitable for implementation on a space-like mobile rover. The environment is characterized by challenging conditions regarding both the visual and structural appearance: severe visual aliasing poses significant limitations to the ability of visual SLAM systems to perform place recognition, while the absence of outstanding structural details, joined with the limited Field-of-View of the utilized Solid-State LiDAR sensor, challenges traditional LiDAR SLAM for the task of pose estimation using point clouds alone. With this data, that covers more than 4 kilometers of travel on soft volcanic slopes, we aim to: 1) provide a tool to expose limitations of state-of-the-art SLAM systems with respect to environments, which are not present in widely available datasets and 2) motivate the development of novel localization and mapping approaches, that rely efficiently on the complementary capabilities of the two sensors.

The dataset includes data from two commercially available devices - a stereoscopic-inertial camera and a multi-beam 3D LiDAR, which also provides inertial measurements. Additionally, we used a tripod-mounted survey grade LiDAR scanner to capture a detailed millimeter-accurate 3D map of the test location (containing $\sim$290 million points). Using the map we inferred centimeter-accurate 6 Degree of Freedom (DoF) ground truth for the position of the device for each LiDAR scan to enable better evaluation of LiDAR and vision localisation, mapping and reconstruction systems. This ground truth is the particular novel contribution of this dataset and we believe that it will enable systematic evaluation which many similar datasets have lacked. The dataset combines both built environments, open spaces and vegetated areas so as to test localization and mapping systems such as vision-based navigation, visual and LiDAR SLAM, 3D LIDAR reconstruction and appearance-based place recognition.

However, most of the current lidar SLAM approaches are based on the assumption of a static environment. Hence the localization in a dynamic environment with multiple moving objects is actually unreliable. The paper proposes a dynamic SLAM framework RF-LIO, building on LIO-SAM, which adds adaptive multi-resolution range images and uses tightly-coupled lidar inertial odometry to first remove moving objects, and then match lidar scan to the submap. Thus, it can obtain accurate poses even in high dynamic environments. The proposed RF-LIO is evaluated on both self-collected datasets and open Urbanloco datasets. The experimental results in high dynamic environments demonstrate that, compared with LOAM and LIO-SAM, the absolute trajectory accuracy of the proposed RF-LIO can be improved by 90% and 70%, respectively. RF-LIO is one of the state-of-the-art SLAM systems in high dynamic environments.</p></details> |  |

However, LiDARs do not perform well in geometrically-degraded environments, due to the challenge of loop closure detection and computational load to perform scan matching. Existing WiFi infrastructure can be exploited for localization and mapping with low hardware and computational cost. Yet, accurate pose estimation using WiFi is challenging as different signal values can be measured at the same location due to the unpredictability of signal propagation. Therefore, we introduce the use of WiFi fingerprint sequence for pose estimation (i.e. loop closure) in SLAM. This approach exploits the spatial coherence of location fingerprints obtained while a mobile robot is moving. This has better capability of correcting odometry drift. The method also incorporates LiDAR scans and thus, improving computational efficiency for large and geometrically-degraded environments while maintaining the accuracy of LiDAR SLAM. We conducted experiments in an indoor environment to illustrate the effectiveness of the method. The results are evaluated based on Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and it has achieved an accuracy of 0.88m for the test environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by the 2022 IEEE 18th International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE)</p></details> |

In particular, ground-optimized LiDAR odometry usually employs ground segmentation as a preprocessing method. This is because most of the points in a 3D point cloud captured by a 3D LiDAR sensor on a terrestrial platform are from the ground. However, the effect of the performance of ground segmentation on LiDAR odometry is still not closely examined. In this paper, a robust ground-optimized LiDAR odometry framework is proposed to facilitate the study to check the effect of ground segmentation on LiDAR SLAM based on the state-of-the-art (SOTA) method. By using our proposed odometry framework, it is easy and straightforward to test whether ground segmentation algorithms help extract well-described features and thus improve SLAM performance. In addition, by leveraging the SOTA ground segmentation method called Patchwork, which shows robust ground segmentation even in complex and uneven urban environments with little performance perturbation, a novel ground-optimized LiDAR odometry is proposed, called PaGO-LOAM. The methods were tested using the KITTI odometry dataset. \textit{PaGO-LOAM} shows robust and accurate performance compared with the baseline method.

However, place recognition and geometric verification using these landmarks is challenging due to the requirement for global matching without an initial guess. Existing works typically only leverage either pole or plane landmarks, limiting application to a restricted set of environments. We present a global data association method for loop closure in lidar scans using 3D line and plane objects simultaneously and in a unified manner. The main novelty of this paper is in the representation of line and plane objects extracted from lidar scans on the manifold of affine subspaces, known as the affine Grassmannian. Line and plane correspondences are matched using our graph-based data association framework and subsequently registered in the least-squares sense. Compared to pole-only approaches and plane-only approaches, our 3D affine Grassmannian method yields a 71% and 325% increase respectively to loop closure recall at 100% precision on the KITTI dataset and can provide frame alignment with less than 10 cm and 1 deg of error.</p></details> |  |

Removing dynamic object is crucial in this situation but become tricky when ego-motion is coupled. In this paper, instead of proposing a new slam framework, we aim at a more general strategy for a localization scenario. In that case, Dynamic Registration is available for integrating with any lidar slam system. We utilize 3D object detection to obtain potential moving objects and remove them temporarily. Then we proposed Dynamic Registration, to iteratively estimate ego-motion and segment moving objects until no static object generates. Static objects are merged with the environment. Finally, we successfully segment dynamic objects, static environments with static objects, and ego-motion estimation in a dynamic environment. We evaluate the performance of our proposed method on KITTI Tracking datasets.

To address this problem, we propose a framework of 2D-LiDAR-based SLAM without manual control that effectively excludes dynamic objects (people) and simplify the process for a robot to map an environment. The framework, which includes three parts: people tracking, filtering and following.

The high-rate inertial data complement the other lower-rate modalities. Moreover, in the absence of constant acceleration, the gravity vector makes two attitude angles out of three observable in the global coordinate frame. In visual odometry, this is already being used to reduce the 6-Degrees Of Freedom (DOF) pose estimation problem to 4-DOF. In lidar SLAM, the gravity measurements are often used as a penalty in the back-end global map optimization to prevent map deformations. In this work, we propose an Iterative Closest Point (ICP)-based front-end which exploits the observable DOF and provides pose estimates aligned with the gravity vector. We believe that this front-end has the potential to support the loop closure identification, thus speeding up convergences of global map optimizations. The presented approach has been extensively tested in large-scale outdoor environments as well as in the Subterranean Challenge organized by Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). We show that it can reduce the localization drift by 30% when compared to the standard 6-DOF ICP. Moreover, the code is readily available to the community as a part of the libpointmatcher library.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

| **[DL-SLOT: Dynamic Lidar SLAM and Object Tracking Based On Graph Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.11431v1)** | 2022-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ego-pose estimation and dynamic object tracking are two key issues in an autonomous driving system. Two assumptions are often made for them, i.e. the static world assumption of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and the exact ego-pose assumption of object tracking, respectively. However, these assumptions are difficult to hold in highly dynamic road scenarios where SLAM and object tracking become correlated and mutually beneficial. In this paper, DL-SLOT, a dynamic Lidar SLAM and object tracking method is proposed. This method integrates the state estimations of both the ego vehicle and the static and dynamic objects in the environment into a unified optimization framework, to realize SLAM and object tracking (SLOT) simultaneously. Firstly, we implement object detection to remove all the points that belong to potential dynamic objects. Then, LiDAR odometry is conducted using the filtered point cloud. At the same time, detected objects are associated with the history object trajectories based on the time-series information in a sliding window. The states of the static and dynamic objects and ego vehicle in the sliding window are integrated into a unified local optimization framework. We perform SLAM and object tracking simultaneously in this framework, which significantly improves the robustness and accuracy of SLAM in highly dynamic road scenarios and the accuracy of objects' states estimation. Experiments on public datasets have shown that our method achieves better accuracy than A-LOAM.</p></details> |  |
| **[LCDNet: Deep Loop Closure Detection and Point Cloud Registration for LiDAR SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.05056v4)** | 2022-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Loop closure detection is an essential component of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems, which reduces the drift accumulated over time. Over the years, several deep learning approaches have been proposed to address this task, however their performance has been subpar compared to handcrafted techniques, especially while dealing with reverse loops. In this paper, we introduce the novel LCDNet that effectively detects loop closures in LiDAR point clouds by simultaneously identifying previously visited places and estimating the 6-DoF relative transformation between the current scan and the map. LCDNet is composed of a shared encoder, a place recognition head that extracts global descriptors, and a relative pose head that estimates the transformation between two point clouds. We introduce a novel relative pose head based on the unbalanced optimal transport theory that we implement in a differentiable manner to allow for end-to-end training. Extensive evaluations of LCDNet on multiple real-world autonomous driving datasets show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art loop closure detection and point cloud registration techniques by a large margin, especially while dealing with reverse loops. Moreover, we integrate our proposed loop closure detection approach into a LiDAR SLAM library to provide a complete mapping system and demonstrate the generalization ability using different sensor setup in an unseen city.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Robotics (T-RO), 2022</p></details> |
| **[SC-LiDAR-SLAM: a Front-end Agnostic Versatile LiDAR SLAM System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.06423v1)** | 2022-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate 3D point cloud map generation is a core task for various robot missions or even for data-driven urban analysis. To do so, light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensor-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) technology have been elaborated. To compose a full SLAM system, many odometry and place recognition methods have independently been proposed in academia. However, they have hardly been integrated or too tightly combined so that exchanging (upgrading) either single odometry or place recognition module is very effort demanding. Recently, the performance of each module has been improved a lot, so it is necessary to build a SLAM system that can effectively integrate them and easily replace them with the latest one. In this paper, we release such a front-end agnostic LiDAR SLAM system, named SC-LiDAR-SLAM. We built a complete SLAM system by designing it modular, and successfully integrating it with Scan Context++ and diverse existing opensource LiDAR odometry methods to generate an accurate point cloud map</p></details> |  |
| **[A Universal LiDAR SLAM Accelerator System on Low-cost FPGA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.09523v2)** | 2021-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) serves as a basis for indoor cleaning, navigation, and many other useful applications in both industry and household. From a series of LiDAR scans, it constructs an accurate, globally consistent model of the environment and estimates a robot position inside it. SLAM is inherently computationally intensive; it is a challenging problem to realize a fast and reliable SLAM system on mobile robots with a limited processing capability. To overcome such hurdles, in this paper, we propose a universal, low-power, and resource-efficient accelerator design for 2D LiDAR SLAM targeting resource-limited FPGAs. As scan matching is at the heart of SLAM, the proposed accelerator consists of dedicated scan matching cores on the programmable logic part, and provides software interfaces to facilitate the use. Our accelerator can be integrated to various SLAM methods including the ROS (Robot Operating System)-based ones, and users can switch to a different method without modifying and re-synthesizing the logic part. We integrate the accelerator into three widely-used methods, i.e., scan matching, particle filter, and graph-based SLAM. We evaluate the design in terms of resource utilization, speed, and quality of output results using real-world datasets. Experiment results on a Pynq-Z2 board demonstrate that our design accelerates scan matching and loop-closure detection tasks by up to 14.84x and 18.92x, yielding 4.67x, 4.00x, and 4.06x overall performance improvement in the above methods, respectively. Our design enables the real-time performance while consuming only 2.4W and maintaining accuracy, which is comparable to the software counterparts and even the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

In most of these systems, they extract features for tracking after ground removal, which causes large variance on the z-axis. Ground actually provides robust information to obtain [t_z, \theta_{roll}, \theta_{pitch}]$. In this project, we followed the LeGO-LOAM, a light-weighted real-time SLAM system that extracts and registers ground as an addition to the original LOAM, and we proposed a new clustering-based method to refine the planar extraction algorithm for ground such that the system can handle much more noisy or dynamic environments. We implemented this method and compared it with LeGo-LOAM on our collected data of CMU campus, as well as a collected dataset for ATV (All-Terrain Vehicle) for off-road self-driving.

To achieve such a comprehensive sensor fusion system, one has to tackle several challenges such as data synchronization, multi-threading programming, bundle adjustment (BA), and conflicting coordinate frames between UWB and the onboard sensors, so as to ensure real-time localization and smooth updates in the state estimates. To this end, we propose a two stage approach. In the first stage, lidar, camera, and IMU data on a local sliding window are processed in a core odometry thread. From this local graph, new key frames are evaluated for admission to a global map. Visual feature-based loop closure is also performed to supplement the global factor graph with loop constraints. When the global factor graph satisfies a condition on spatial diversity, the BA process will be triggered to update the coordinate transform between UWB and onboard SLAM systems. The system then seamlessly transitions to the second stage where all sensors are tightly integrated in the odometry thread. The capability of our system is demonstrated via several experiments on high-fidelity graphical-physical simulation and public datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[AEROS: Adaptive RObust least-Squares for Graph-Based SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.02018v1)** | 2021-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In robot localisation and mapping, outliers are unavoidable when loop-closure measurements are taken into account. A single false-positive loop-closure can have a very negative impact on SLAM problems causing an inferior trajectory to be produced or even for the optimisation to fail entirely. To address this issue, popular existing approaches define a hard switch for each loop-closure constraint. This paper presents AEROS, a novel approach to adaptively solve a robust least-squares minimisation problem by adding just a single extra latent parameter. It can be used in the back-end component of the SLAM problem to enable generalised robust cost minimisation by simultaneously estimating the continuous latent parameter along with the set of sensor poses in a single joint optimisation. This leads to a very closely curve fitting on the distribution of the residuals, thereby reducing the effect of outliers. Additionally, we formulate the robust optimisation problem using standard Gaussian factors so that it can be solved by direct application of popular incremental estimation approaches such as iSAM. Experimental results on publicly available synthetic datasets and real LiDAR-SLAM datasets collected from the 2D and 3D LiDAR systems show the competitiveness of our approach with the state-of-the-art techniques and its superiority on real world scenarios.</p></details> | 13 |

Although some systems exist already, they are either not accurate or they struggle in real-time setting. In this paper, we propose a fast, accurate and modular LiDAR SLAM system for both batch and online estimation. We first apply downsampling and outlier removal, to filter out noise and reduce the size of the input point clouds. Filtered clouds are then used for pose tracking and floor detection, to ground-optimize the estimated trajectory. The availability of a pre-tracker, working in parallel with the filtering process, allows to obtain pre-computed odometries, to be used as aids when performing tracking. Efficient loop closure and pose optimization, achieved through a g2o pose graph, are the last steps of the proposed SLAM pipeline. We compare the performance of our system with state-of-the-art point cloud based methods, LOAM, LeGO-LOAM, A-LOAM, LeGO-LOAM-BOR and HDL, and show that the proposed system achieves equal or better accuracy and can easily handle even cases without loops. The comparison is done evaluating the estimated trajectory displacement using the KITTI and RADIATE datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is currently under review</p></details> |

Against the backdrop of more affordable 3D LiDAR sensors, research on 3D LiDAR SLAM is becoming increasingly popular. Furthermore, the re-localization problem with a point cloud map is the foundation for other SLAM applications. In this paper, a template matching framework is proposed to re-localize a robot globally in a 3D LiDAR map. This presents two main challenges. First, most global descriptors for point cloud can only be used for place detection under a small local area. Therefore, in order to re-localize globally in the map, point clouds and descriptors(templates) are densely collected using a reconstructed mesh model at an offline stage by a physical simulation engine to expand the functional distance of point cloud descriptors. Second, the increased number of collected templates makes the matching stage too slow to meet the real-time requirement, for which a cascade matching method is presented for better efficiency. In the experiments, the proposed framework achieves 0.2-meter accuracy at about 10Hz matching speed using pure python implementation with 100k templates, which is effective and efficient for SLAM applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

This is particularly useful in indoor environments where other localization technologies, such as GNSS, fail. Indoor spaces impose interesting challenges on visual localization algorithms: occlusions due to people, textureless surfaces, large viewpoint changes, low light, repetitive textures, etc. Existing indoor datasets are either comparably small or do only cover a subset of the mentioned challenges. In this paper, we introduce 5 new indoor datasets for visual localization in challenging real-world environments. They were captured in a large shopping mall and a large metro station in Seoul, South Korea, using a dedicated mapping platform consisting of 10 cameras and 2 laser scanners. In order to obtain accurate ground truth camera poses, we developed a robust LiDAR SLAM which provides initial poses that are then refined using a novel structure-from-motion based optimization. We present a benchmark of modern visual localization algorithms on these challenging datasets showing superior performance of structure-based methods using robust image features.

To this end, we propose MULLS, an efficient, low-drift, and versatile 3D LiDAR SLAM system. For the front-end, roughly classified feature points (ground, facade, pillar, beam, etc.) are extracted from each frame using dual-threshold ground filtering and principal components analysis. Then the registration between the current frame and the local submap is accomplished efficiently by the proposed multi-metric linear least square iterative closest point algorithm. Point-to-point (plane, line) error metrics within each point class are jointly optimized with a linear approximation to estimate the ego-motion. Static feature points of the registered frame are appended into the local map to keep it updated. For the back-end, hierarchical pose graph optimization is conducted among regularly stored history submaps to reduce the drift resulting from dead reckoning. Extensive experiments are carried out on three datasets with more than 100,000 frames collected by seven types of LiDAR on various outdoor and indoor scenarios. On the KITTI benchmark, MULLS ranks among the top LiDAR-only SLAM systems with real-time performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Codes...</summary><p>Codes: https://github.com/YuePanEdward/MULLS, Accepted by ICRA 2021</p></details> |

However, camera and LiDAR based SLAM systems can be fragile when facing challenging illumination or weather conditions which degrade their imagery and point cloud data. Radar, whose operating electromagnetic spectrum is less affected by environmental changes, is promising although its distinct sensing geometry and noise characteristics bring open challenges when being exploited for SLAM. % However, there are still open challenges since most existing visual and LiDAR SLAM systems do not operate in bad weathers. This paper studies the use of a Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave radar for SLAM in large-scale outdoor environments. We propose a full radar SLAM system, including a novel radar motion tracking algorithm that leverages radar geometry for reliable feature tracking. It also optimally compensates motion distortion and estimates pose by joint optimization. Its loop closure component is designed to be simple yet efficient for radar imagery by capturing and exploiting structural information of the surrounding environment. % while a scheme to reject ambiguous loop closure candidates is also designed specifically for radar. Extensive experiments on three public radar datasets, ranging from city streets and residential areas to countryside and highways, show competitive accuracy and reliability performance of the proposed radar SLAM system compared to the state-of-the-art LiDAR, vision and radar methods. The results show that our system is technically viable in achieving reliable SLAM in extreme weather conditions, e.g. heavy snow and dense fog, demonstrating the promising potential of using radar for all-weather localization and mapping.</p></details> | Under review |

To overcome this challenge and support the deployment of robots in real world scenarios, we propose a complete solution for a dynamic object aware LiDAR SLAM algorithm. This is achieved by leveraging a real-time capable neural network that can detect dynamic objects, thus allowing our system to deal with them explicitly. To efficiently generate the necessary training data which is key to our approach, we present a novel end-to-end occupancy grid based pipeline that can automatically label a wide variety of arbitrary dynamic objects. Our solution can thus generalize to different environments without the need for expensive manual labeling and at the same time avoids assumptions about the presence of a predefined set of known objects in the scene. Using this technique, we automatically label over 12000 LiDAR scans collected in an urban environment with a large amount of pedestrians and use this data to train a neural network, achieving an average segmentation IoU of 0.82. We show that explicitly dealing with dynamic objects can improve the LiDAR SLAM odometry performance by 39.6% while yielding maps which better represent the environments.

However, they commonly have a high latency due to the expensive data association and nonlinear optimization. This paper demonstrates that actively selecting a subset of features significantly improves both the accuracy and efficiency of an L-SLAM system. We formulate the feature selection as a combinatorial optimization problem under a cardinality constraint to preserve the information matrix's spectral attributes. The stochastic-greedy algorithm is applied to approximate the optimal results in real-time. To avoid ill-conditioned estimation, we also propose a general strategy to evaluate the environment's degeneracy and modify the feature number online. The proposed feature selector is integrated into a multi-LiDAR SLAM system. We validate this enhanced system with extensive experiments covering various scenarios on two sensor setups and computation platforms.

To make a lightweight the algorithm, most SLAM systems rely on feature detection from images for vision SLAM or point cloud for laser-based methods. Feature detection through a 3D point cloud becomes a computationally challenging task. In this paper, we propose a feature detection method by projecting a 3D point cloud to form an image and apply the vision-based feature detection technique. The proposed method gives repeatable and stable features in a variety of environments. Based on such features, we build a 6-DOF SLAM system consisting of tracking, mapping, and loop closure threads. For loop detection, we employ a 2-step approach i.e. nearest key-frames detection and loop candidate verification by matching features extracted from rasterized LIDAR images. Furthermore, we utilize a key-frame structure to achieve a lightweight SLAM system. The proposed system is evaluated with implementation on the KITTI dataset and the University of Michigan Ford Campus dataset. Through experimental results, we show that the algorithm presented in this paper can substantially reduce the computational cost of feature detection from the point cloud and the whole SLAM system while giving accurate results.</p></details> |  |

Existing SLAM methods are mainly developed for mechanical LiDAR sensors, which are often adopted by large scale robots. Recently, the solid-state LiDAR is introduced and becomes popular since it provides a cost-effective and lightweight solution for small scale robots. Compared to mechanical LiDAR, solid-state LiDAR sensors have higher update frequency and angular resolution, but also have smaller field of view (FoV), which is very challenging for existing LiDAR SLAM algorithms. Therefore, it is necessary to have a more robust and computationally efficient SLAM method for this new sensing device. To this end, we propose a new SLAM framework for solid-state LiDAR sensors, which involves feature extraction, odometry estimation, and probability map building.

It is widely used in robotic applications such as autonomous driving and drone delivery. Traditional LiDAR-based SLAM algorithms mainly leverage the geometric features from the scene context, while the intensity information from LiDAR is ignored. Some recent deep-learning-based SLAM algorithms consider intensity features and train the pose estimation network in an end-to-end manner. However, they require significant data collection effort and their generalizability to environments other than the trained one remains unclear. In this paper we introduce intensity features to a SLAM system. And we propose a novel full SLAM framework that leverages both geometry and intensity features. The proposed SLAM involves both intensity-based front-end odometry estimation and intensity-based back-end optimization.

| **[BALM: Bundle Adjustment for Lidar Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08215v2)** | 2021-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A local Bundle Adjustment (BA) on a sliding window of keyframes has been widely used in visual SLAM and proved to be very effective in lowering the drift. But in lidar SLAM, BA method is hardly used because the sparse feature points (e.g., edge and plane) make the exact point matching impossible. In this paper, we formulate the lidar BA as minimizing the distance from a feature point to its matched edge or plane. Unlike the visual SLAM (and prior plane adjustment method in lidar SLAM) where the feature has to be co-determined along with the pose, we show that the feature can be analytically solved and removed from the BA, the resultant BA is only dependent on the scan poses. This greatly reduces the optimization scale and allows large-scale dense plane and edge features to be used. To speedup the optimization, we derive the analytical derivatives of the cost function, up to second order, in closed form. Moreover, we propose a novel adaptive voxelization method to search feature correspondence efficiently. The proposed formulations are incorporated into a LOAM back-end for map refinement. Results show that, although as a back-end, the local BA can be solved very efficiently, even in real-time at 10Hz when optimizing 20 scans of point-cloud. The local BA also considerably lowers the LOAM drift. Our implementation of the BA optimization and LOAM are open-sourced to benefit the community.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 9 figures, conference</p></details> |

The AgScan3D data is processed through a Continuous-Time SLAM algorithm into a globally registered 3D ray cloud. The global ray cloud is a canonical data format (a digital twin) from which we can compare vineyard snapshots over multiple times within a season and across seasons. Then, the vineyard rows are automatically extracted from the ray cloud and a novel density calculation is performed to estimate the maximum likelihood canopy densities of the vineyard. This combination of digital twinning, together with the accurate extraction of canopy structure information, allows entire vineyards to be analysed and compared, across the growing season and from year to year. The proposed method is evaluated both in simulation and field experiments. Field experiments were performed at four sites, which varied in vineyard structure and vine management, over two growing seasons and 64 data collection campaigns, resulting in a total traversal of 160 kilometres, 42.4 scanned hectares of vines with a combined total of approximately 93,000 scanned vines. Our experiments show canopy density repeatability of 3.8% (Relative RMSE) per vineyard panel, for acquisition speeds of 5-6 km/h, and under half the standard deviation in estimated densities when compared to an industry standard gap-fraction based solution.

However, LiDAR-SLAM suffers from accumulating errors which can be significantly mitigated by Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). Precise Point Positioning (PPP), an accurate GNSS operation mode independent of base stations, gains more popularity in unmanned systems. Considering the features of the two technologies, LiDAR-SLAM and PPP, this paper proposes a SLAM system, namely P3-LOAM (PPP based LiDAR Odometry and Mapping) which couples LiDAR-SLAM and PPP. For better integration, we derive LiDAR-SLAM positioning covariance by using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) Jacobian model, since SVD provides an explicit analytic solution of Iterative Closest Point (ICP), which is a key issue in LiDAR-SLAM. A novel method is then proposed to evaluate the estimated LiDAR-SLAM covariance. In addition, to increase the reliability of GNSS in urban canyon environment, we develop a LiDAR-SLAM assisted GNSS Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM) algorithm. Finally, we validate P$^3$-LOAM with UrbanNav, a challenging public dataset in urban canyon environment. Comprehensive test results prove that P3-LOAM outperforms benchmarks such as Single Point Positioning (SPP), PPP, LeGO-LOAM, SPP-LOAM, and loosely coupled navigation system proposed by the publisher of UrbanNav in terms of accuracy and availability.</p></details> |  |

Recent development of low-cost lidars (e.g. Livox lidar) enable us to explore such SLAM systems with lower budget and higher performance. In this paper we propose CamVox by adapting Livox lidars into visual SLAM (ORB-SLAM2) by exploring the lidars' unique features. Based on the non-repeating nature of Livox lidars, we propose an automatic lidar-camera calibration method that will work in uncontrolled scenes. The long depth detection range also benefit a more efficient mapping. Comparison of CamVox with visual SLAM (VINS-mono) and lidar SLAM (LOAM) are evaluated on the same dataset to demonstrate the performance. We open sourced our hardware, code and dataset on GitHub.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 10 figures, Submitted to ICRA2021</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose a resource-efficient FPGA implementation for accelerating scan matching computations, which typically cause a major bottleneck in 2D LiDAR SLAM methods. Scan matching is a process of correcting a robot pose by aligning the latest LiDAR measurements with an occupancy grid map, which encodes the information about the surrounding environment. We exploit an inherent parallelism in the Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filter (RBPF) based algorithms to perform scan matching computations for multiple particles in parallel. In the proposed design, several techniques are employed to reduce the resource utilization and to achieve the maximum throughput. Experimental results using the benchmark datasets show that the scan matching is accelerated by 5.31-8.75x and the overall throughput is improved by 3.72-5.10x without seriously degrading the quality of the final outputs. Furthermore, our proposed IP core requires only 44% of the total resources available in the TUL Pynq-Z2 FPGA board, thus facilitating the realization of SLAM applications on indoor mobile robots.</p></details> |  |

Satisfactory performance can be obtained using high-grade 3D LiDAR with 64 channels, which can provide dense point clouds. Unfortunately, the high price significantly prevents its extensive commercialization in ADV. The cost-effective 3D LiDAR with 16 channels is a promising replacement. However, only limited and sparse point clouds can be provided by the 16 channels LiDAR, which cannot guarantee sufficient positioning accuracy for ADV in challenging dynamic environments. The high-resolution image from the low-cost camera can provide ample information about the surroundings. However, the explicit depth information is not available from the image. Inspired by the complementariness of 3D LiDAR and camera, this paper proposes to make use of the high-resolution images from a camera to enrich the raw 3D point clouds from the low-cost 16 channels LiDAR based on a state-of-the-art deep learning algorithm. An ERFNet is firstly employed to segment the image with the aid of the raw sparse 3D point clouds. Meanwhile, the sparse convolutional neural network is employed to predict the dense point clouds based on raw sparse 3D point clouds. Then, the predicted dense point clouds are fused with the segmentation outputs from ERFnet using a novel multi-layer convolutional neural network to refine the predicted 3D point clouds. Finally, the enriched point clouds are employed to perform LiDAR SLAM based on the state-of-the-art normal distribution transform (NDT). We tested our approach on the re-edited KITTI datasets: (1)the sparse 3D point clouds are significantly enriched with a mean square error of 1.1m MSE. (2)the map generated from the LiDAR SLAM is denser which includes more details without significant accuracy loss.</p></details> |  |

This approach reduces the cost of loop closure while still provides large-scale fusion-based dense maps, when compared to the trajectory-centric SLAM approaches. In this paper, we present a novel framework for 3D LiDAR-based map-centric SLAM. Having the advantages of a map-centric approach, our method exhibits new features to overcome the shortcomings of existing systems, associated with multi-modal sensor fusion and LiDAR motion distortion. This is accomplished through the use of a local Continuous-Time (CT) trajectory representation. Also, our surface resolution preservative matching algorithm and Wishart-based surfel fusion model enables non-redundant yet dense mapping. Furthermore, we present a robust metric loop closure model to make the approach stable regardless of where the loop closure occurs. Finally, we demonstrate our approach through both simulation and real data experiments using multiple sensor payload configurations and environments to illustrate its utility and robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Robotics</p></details> |

We utilize spatial GP regression to model the environment. This tool enables us to recover surfaces including those in sparsely scanned areas and obtain uniform samples with uncertainty. Those properties facilitate robust data association and map updating in our scan-to-map registration scheme, especially when working with sparse range data. Compared with previous GP-SLAM, this work overcomes the prohibitive computational complexity of GP and redesigns the registration strategy to meet the accuracy requirements in 3D scenarios. For large-scale tasks, a two-thread framework is employed to suppress the drift further. Aerial and ground-based experiments demonstrate that our method allows robust odometry and precise mapping in real-time. It also outperforms the state-of-the-art lidar SLAM systems in our tests with light-weight sensors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IROS 2020</p></details> |

These facilities can be badly lit and comprised of indistinct metallic structures, thus our system uses only LiDAR sensing and was developed to run on the quadruped robot's navigation PC. Point clouds are accumulated using an inertial-kinematic state estimator before being aligned using ICP registration. To close loops we use a loop proposal mechanism which matches individual segments between clouds. We trained a descriptor offline to match these segments. The efficiency of our method comes from carefully designing the network architecture to minimize the number of parameters such that this deep learning method can be deployed in real-time using only the CPU of a legged robot, a major contribution of this work. The set of odometry and loop closure factors are updated using pose graph optimization. Finally we present an efficient risk alignment prediction method which verifies the reliability of the registrations. Experimental results at an industrial facility demonstrated the robustness and flexibility of our system, including autonomous following paths derived from the SLAM map.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 9 figures, accepted for IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA 2020)</p></details> |
| **[DeepMapping: Unsupervised Map Estimation From Multiple Point Clouds](http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.11397v2)** | 2019-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose DeepMapping, a novel registration framework using deep neural networks (DNNs) as auxiliary functions to align multiple point clouds from scratch to a globally consistent frame. We use DNNs to model the highly non-convex mapping process that traditionally involves hand-crafted data association, sensor pose initialization, and global refinement. Our key novelty is that "training" these DNNs with properly defined unsupervised losses is equivalent to solving the underlying registration problem, but less sensitive to good initialization than ICP. Our framework contains two DNNs: a localization network that estimates the poses for input point clouds, and a map network that models the scene structure by estimating the occupancy status of global coordinates. This allows us to convert the registration problem to a binary occupancy classification, which can be solved efficiently using gradient-based optimization. We further show that DeepMapping can be readily extended to address the problem of Lidar SLAM by imposing geometric constraints between consecutive point clouds. Experiments are conducted on both simulated and real datasets. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons demonstrate that DeepMapping often enables more robust and accurate global registration of multiple point clouds than existing techniques.

The proposed methods, named E-InEKF and E-IS, fuse kinematics, IMU, LiDAR, and GPS data to mitigate position drift, particularly along the z-axis, a common issue in proprioceptive-based approaches. We derived observation models that satisfy group-affine properties to integrate LiDAR odometry and GPS into InEKF and IS. LiDAR odometry is incorporated using Iterative Closest Point (ICP) registration on a parallel thread, preserving the computational efficiency of proprioceptive-based state estimation. We evaluate E-InEKF and E-IS with and without exteroceptive sensors, benchmarking them against LiDAR-based odometry methods in indoor and outdoor experiments using the KAIST HOUND2 robot. Our methods achieve lower Relative Position Errors (RPE) and significantly reduce Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE), with improvements of up to 28% indoors and 40% outdoors compared to LIO-SAM and FAST-LIO2.

While 3D LiDAR SLAM has received notable improvements in recent years, 2D SLAM lags behind. Gradual drifts in odometry and pose estimation inaccuracies hinder modern 2D LiDAR-odometry algorithms in large complex environments. Dynamic robotic motion coupled with inherent estimation based SLAM processes introduce noise and errors, degrading map quality. Occupancy Grid Mapping (OGM) produces results that are often noisy and unclear. This is due to the fact that evidence based mapping represents maps according to uncertain observations. This is why OGMs are so popular in exploration or navigation tasks. However, this also limits OGMs' effectiveness for specific mapping based tasks such as floor plan creation in complex scenes. To address this, we propose our novel Transformation and Translation Occupancy Grid Mapping (TT-OGM). We adapt and enable accurate and robust pose estimation techniques from 3D SLAM to the world of 2D and mitigate errors to improve map quality using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). We introduce a novel data generation method via deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to build datasets large enough for training a GAN for SLAM error correction. We demonstrate our SLAM in real-time on data collected at Loughborough University. We also prove its generalisability on a variety of large complex environments on a collection of large scale well-known 2D occupancy maps. Our novel approach enables the creation of high quality OGMs in complex scenes, far surpassing the capabilities of current SLAM algorithms in terms of quality, accuracy and reliability.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, preprint, submitted to Robotics And Autonomous Systems</p></details> |

SLAM systems often encounter challenges due to the dynamic nature of robotic motion, leading to inaccuracies in mapping quality, particularly in 2D representations such as Occupancy Grid Maps. These errors can significantly degrade map quality, hindering the effectiveness of specific downstream tasks such as floor plan creation. To address this challenge, we introduce our novel 'GAN-SLAM', a new SLAM approach that leverages Generative Adversarial Networks to clean and complete occupancy grids during the SLAM process, reducing the impact of noise and inaccuracies introduced on the output map. We adapt and integrate accurate pose estimation techniques typically used for 3D SLAM into a 2D form. This enables the quality improvement 3D LiDAR-odometry has seen in recent years to be effective for 2D representations. Our results demonstrate substantial improvements in map fidelity and quality, with minimal noise and errors, affirming the effectiveness of GAN-SLAM for real-world mapping applications within large-scale complex environments. We validate our approach on real-world data operating in real-time, and on famous examples of 2D maps. The improved quality of the output map enables new downstream tasks, such as floor plan drafting, further enhancing the capabilities of autonomous systems. Our novel approach to SLAM offers a significant step forward in the field, improving the usability for SLAM in mapping-based tasks, and offers insight into the usage of GANs for OGM error correction.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, preprint conference submission</p></details> |

Especially when HD maps are used, a precise and repeatable method has to be chosen. Therefore accurate map generation but also re-localization against these maps is necessary. Due to best 3D reconstruction of the surrounding, LiDAR has become a reliable modality for localization. The latest LiDAR odometry estimation are based on iterative closest point (ICP) approaches, namely KISS-ICP and SAGE-ICP. We extend the capabilities of KISS-ICP by incorporating semantic information into the point alignment process using a generalizable approach with minimal parameter tuning. This enhancement allows us to surpass KISS-ICP in terms of absolute trajectory error (ATE), the primary metric for map accuracy. Additionally, we improve the Cartographer mapping framework to handle semantic information. Cartographer facilitates loop closure detection over larger areas, mitigating odometry drift and further enhancing ATE accuracy. By integrating semantic information into the mapping process, we enable the filtering of specific classes, such as parked vehicles, from the resulting map. This filtering improves relocalization quality by addressing temporal changes, such as vehicles being moved.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Initialization for LiDAR-inertial SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01451v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The accuracy of the initial state, including initial velocity, gravity direction, and IMU biases, is critical for the initialization of LiDAR-inertial SLAM systems. Inaccurate initial values can reduce initialization speed or lead to failure. When the system faces urgent tasks, robust and fast initialization is required while the robot is moving, such as during the swift assessment of rescue environments after natural disasters, bomb disposal, and restarting LiDAR-inertial SLAM in rescue missions. However, existing initialization methods usually require the platform to remain stationary, which is ineffective when the robot is in motion. To address this issue, this paper introduces a robust and fast dynamic initialization method for LiDAR-inertial systems (D-LI-Init). This method iteratively aligns LiDAR-based odometry with IMU measurements to achieve system initialization. To enhance the reliability of the LiDAR odometry module, the LiDAR and gyroscope are tightly integrated within the ESIKF framework. The gyroscope compensates for rotational distortion in the point cloud. Translational distortion compensation occurs during the iterative update phase, resulting in the output of LiDAR-gyroscope odometry. The proposed method can initialize the system no matter the robot is moving or stationary. Experiments on public datasets and real-world environments demonstrate that the D-LI-Init algorithm can effectively serve various platforms, including vehicles, handheld devices, and UAVs. D-LI-Init completes dynamic initialization regardless of specific motion patterns. To benefit the research community, we have open-sourced our code and test datasets on GitHub.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics</p></details> |

In order to solve these problems, we propose a novel LIDAR-based localization framework, which achieves high accuracy and provides robust localization in 3D pointcloud maps with information of multi-sensors. The system integrates global information with LIDAR-based odometry to optimize the localization state. To improve robustness and enable fast resumption of localization, this paper uses offline pointcloud maps for prior knowledge and presents a novel registration method to speed up the convergence rate. The algorithm is tested on various maps of different data sets and has higher robustness and accuracy than other localization algorithms.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we build on recent advancements in Gaussian Splatting methods to develop a novel LiDAR odometry and mapping pipeline that exclusively relies on Gaussian primitives for its scene representation. Leveraging spherical projection, we drive the refinement of the primitives uniquely from LiDAR measurements. Experiments show that our approach matches the current registration performance, while achieving SOTA results for mapping tasks with minimal GPU requirements. This efficiency makes it a strong candidate for further exploration and potential adoption in real-time robotics estimation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[KISS-SLAM: A Simple, Robust, and Accurate 3D LiDAR SLAM System With Enhanced Generalization Capabilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12660v1)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust and accurate localization and mapping of an environment using laser scanners, so-called LiDAR SLAM, is essential to many robotic applications. Early 3D LiDAR SLAM methods often exploited additional information from IMU or GNSS sensors to enhance localization accuracy and mitigate drift. Later, advanced systems further improved the estimation at the cost of a higher runtime and complexity. This paper explores the limits of what can be achieved with a LiDAR-only SLAM approach while following the "Keep It Small and Simple" (KISS) principle. By leveraging this minimalistic design principle, our system, KISS-SLAM, archives state-of-the-art performances in pose accuracy while requiring little to no parameter tuning for deployment across diverse environments, sensors, and motion profiles. We follow best practices in graph-based SLAM and build upon LiDAR odometry to compute the relative motion between scans and construct local maps of the environment. To correct drift, we match local maps and optimize the trajectory in a pose graph optimization step. The experimental results demonstrate that this design achieves competitive performance while reducing complexity and reliance on additional sensor modalities. By prioritizing simplicity, this work provides a new strong baseline for LiDAR-only SLAM and a high-performing starting point for future research. Further, our pipeline builds consistent maps that can be used directly for further downstream tasks like navigation. Our open-source system operates faster than the sensor frame rate in all presented datasets and is designed for real-world scenarios.</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[Robustness of LiDAR-Based Pose Estimation: Evaluating and Improving Odometry and Localization Under Common Point Cloud Corruptions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10824v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and reliable pose estimation, i.e., determining the precise position and orientation of autonomous robots and vehicles, is critical for tasks like navigation and mapping. LiDAR is a widely used sensor for pose estimation, with odometry and localization being two primary tasks. LiDAR odometry estimates the relative motion between consecutive scans, while LiDAR localization aligns real-time scans with a pre-recorded map to obtain a global pose. Although they have different objectives and application scenarios, both rely on point cloud registration as the underlying technique and face shared challenges of data corruption caused by adverse conditions (e.g., rain). While state-of-the-art (SOTA) pose estimation systems achieved high accuracy on clean data, their robustness to corrupted data remains unclear. In this work, we propose a framework to systematically evaluate five SOTA LiDAR pose estimation systems across 18 synthetic real-world point cloud corruptions. Our experiments reveal that odometry systems degrade significantly under specific corruptions, with relative position errors increasing from 0.5% to more than 80%, while localization systems remain highly robust. We further demonstrate that denoising techniques can effectively mitigate the adverse effects of noise-induced corruptions, and re-training learning-based systems with corrupted data significantly enhances the robustness against various corruption types.</p></details> |  |

However, low-quality radar points hinder its application, especially the odometry task that requires a dense and accurate matching. To fully explore the potential of 4D radar, we introduce a learning-based odometry framework, enabling robust ego-motion estimation from finite and uncertain geometry information. First, for sparse radar points, we propose a local completion to supplement missing structures and provide denser guideline for aligning two frames. Then, a context-aware association with a hierarchical structure flexibly matches points of different scales aided by feature similarity, and improves local matching consistency through correlation balancing. Finally, we present a window-based optimizer that uses historical priors to establish a coupling state estimation and correct errors of inter-frame matching. The superiority of our algorithm is confirmed on View-of-Delft dataset, achieving around a 50% performance improvement over previous approaches and delivering accuracy on par with LiDAR odometry. Our code will be available.</p></details> | 7 pages, 7 figures |

Simultaneously receiving data from both the LiDAR and the camera, the framework utilizes the color information from the camera images to colorize the LiDAR point clouds and then performs iterative pose optimization. For each LiDAR scan, the edge and planar features are extracted and colored using the corresponding image and then matched to a global map. Specifically, we adopt a perceptually uniform color difference weighting strategy to exclude color correspondence outliers and a robust error metric based on the Welsch's function to mitigate the impact of positional correspondence outliers during the pose optimization process. As a result, the system achieves accurate localization and reconstructs dense, accurate, colored and three-dimensional (3D) maps of the environment. Thorough experiments with challenging scenarios, including complex forests and a campus, show that our method provides higher robustness and accuracy compared with current state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ground-Optimized 4D Radar-Inertial Odometry via Continuous Velocity Integration using Gaussian Process](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08093v2)** | 2025-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Radar ensures robust sensing capabilities in adverse weather conditions, yet challenges remain due to its high inherent noise level. Existing radar odometry has overcome these challenges with strategies such as filtering spurious points, exploiting Doppler velocity, or integrating with inertial measurements. This paper presents two novel improvements beyond the existing radar-inertial odometry: ground-optimized noise filtering and continuous velocity preintegration. Despite the widespread use of ground planes in LiDAR odometry, imprecise ground point distributions of radar measurements cause naive plane fitting to fail. Unlike plane fitting in LiDAR, we introduce a zone-based uncertainty-aware ground modeling specifically designed for radar. Secondly, we note that radar velocity measurements can be better combined with IMU for a more accurate preintegration in radar-inertial odometry. Existing methods often ignore temporal discrepancies between radar and IMU by simplifying the complexities of asynchronous data streams with discretized propagation models. Tackling this issue, we leverage GP and formulate a continuous preintegration method for tightly integrating 3-DOF linear velocity with IMU, facilitating full 6-DOF motion directly from the raw measurements. Our approach demonstrates remarkable performance (less than 1% vertical drift) in public datasets with meticulous conditions, illustrating substantial improvement in elevation accuracy.

| **[Doppler Correspondence: Non-Iterative Scan Matching With Doppler Velocity-Based Correspondence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11461v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving successful scan matching is essential for LiDAR odometry. However, in challenging environments with adverse weather conditions or repetitive geometric patterns, LiDAR odometry performance is degraded due to incorrect scan matching. Recently, the emergence of frequency-modulated continuous wave 4D LiDAR and 4D radar technologies has provided the potential to address these unfavorable conditions. The term 4D refers to point cloud data characterized by range, azimuth, and elevation along with Doppler velocity. Although 4D data is available, most scan matching methods for 4D LiDAR and 4D radar still establish correspondence by repeatedly identifying the closest points between consecutive scans, overlooking the Doppler information. This paper introduces, for the first time, a simple Doppler velocity-based correspondence -- Doppler Correspondence -- that is invariant to translation and small rotation of the sensor, with its geometric and kinematic foundations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method enables the direct matching of consecutive point clouds without an iterative process, making it computationally efficient. Additionally, it provides a more robust correspondence estimation in environments with repetitive geometric patterns.</p></details> |  |

Considering single LiDAR odometry often faces hardware failures and degeneracy in practical scenarios, Multi-LiDAR Odometry (MLO), as an emerging technology, is studied to enhance the performance of LiDAR-based localization and mapping systems. However, MLO can suffer from high computational complexity introduced by dense point clouds that are fused from multiple LiDARs, and the continuous-time measurement characteristic is constantly neglected by existing LiDAR odometry. This motivates us to develop a Continuous-Time and Efficient MLO, namely CTE-MLO, which can achieve accurate and real-time estimation using multi-LiDAR measurements through a continuous-time perspective. In this paper, the Gaussian process estimation is naturally combined with the Kalman filter, which enables each LiDAR point in a point stream to query the corresponding continuous-time trajectory using its time instants. A decentralized multi-LiDAR synchronization scheme is also devised to combine points from separate LiDARs into a single point cloud without the primary LiDAR assignment. Moreover, with the aim of improving the real-time performance of MLO without sacrificing robustness, a point cloud sampling strategy is designed with the consideration of localizability. To this end, CTE-MLO integrates synchronization, localizability-aware sampling, continuous-time estimation, and voxel map management within a Kalman filter framework, which can achieve high accuracy and robust continuous-time estimation within only a few linear iterations. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through various scenarios, including public datasets and real-world applications. The code is available at https://github.com/shenhm516/CTE-MLO to benefit the community.</p></details> |  |

LiDAR odometry systems are usually based on some form of point cloud registration to compute the ego-motion of a mobile robot. Yet, few of today's LiDAR odometry systems consider domain-specific knowledge or the kinematic model of the mobile platform during the point cloud alignment. In this paper, we present Kinematic-ICP, a LiDAR odometry system that focuses on wheeled mobile robots equipped with a 3D LiDAR and moving on a planar surface, which is a common assumption for warehouses, offices, hospitals, etc. Our approach introduces kinematic constraints within the optimization of a traditional point-to-point iterative closest point scheme. In this way, the resulting motion follows the kinematic constraints of the platform, effectively exploiting the robot's wheel odometry and the 3D LiDAR observations. We dynamically adjust the influence of LiDAR measurements and wheel odometry in our optimization scheme, allowing the system to handle degenerate scenarios such as feature-poor corridors. We evaluate our approach on robots operating in large-scale warehouse environments, but also outdoors. The experiments show that our approach achieves top performances and is more accurate than wheel odometry and common LiDAR odometry systems. Kinematic-ICP has been recently deployed in the Dexory fleet of robots operating in warehouses worldwide at their customers' sites, showing that our method can run in the real world alongside a complete navigation stack.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICRA 2025</p></details> |

Yet, no available dataset recording method allows for fully dense accurate depth estimation in a large scale dynamic environment. In this paper, we introduce DOC-Depth, a novel, efficient and easy-to-deploy approach for dense depth generation from any LiDAR sensor. After reconstructing consistent dense 3D environment using LiDAR odometry, we address dynamic objects occlusions automatically thanks to DOC, our state-of-the art dynamic object classification method. Additionally, DOC-Depth is fast and scalable, allowing for the creation of unbounded datasets in terms of size and time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the KITTI dataset, improving its density from 16.1% to 71.2% and release this new fully dense depth annotation, to facilitate future research in the domain. We also showcase results using various LiDAR sensors and in multiple environments.

In such scenarios, environmental sensing is essential for reliable operation. However, approaches such as LiDAR odometry and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) suffer from drift over long distances, especially in the absence of loop closures. Map-based localization offers a robust alternative, but the challenge lies in creating and georeferencing maps without GNSS support. To address this issue, we propose a method for creating georeferenced maps without GNSS by using publicly available data, such as building footprints and surface models derived from sparse aerial scans. Our approach integrates these data with onboard LiDAR scans to produce dense, accurate, georeferenced 3D point cloud maps. By combining an Iterative Closest Point (ICP) scan-to-scan and scan-to-map matching strategy, we achieve high local consistency without suffering from long-term drift. Thus, we eliminate the reliance on GNSS for the creation of georeferenced maps. The results demonstrate that LiDAR-only mapping can produce accurate georeferenced point cloud maps when augmented with existing map priors.</p></details> |  |

However, a notable gap exists in evaluating datasets representing natural, unstructured environments such as forests or gardens. To address this, we present a study on localisation at the Australian Botanic Garden Mount Annan. This area encompasses open grassy areas, paved pathways, and densely vegetated sections with trees and other objects. The dataset was recorded using a 128-beam LiDAR sensor and GPS and IMU readings to track the ego-vehicle. This paper evaluates the performance of two state-of-the-art LiDARinertial odometry frameworks, COIN-LIO and LIO-SAM, on this dataset. We analyse trajectory estimates in both horizontal and vertical dimensions and assess relative translation and yaw errors over varying distances. Our findings reveal that while both frameworks perform adequately in the vertical plane, COINLIO demonstrates superior accuracy in the horizontal plane, particularly over extended trajectories. In contrast, LIO-SAM shows increased drift and yaw errors over longer distances.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 2...</summary><p>The 2024 Australasian Conference on Robotics and Automation (ACRA 2024)</p></details> |

One key contribution of this work to 3D LiDAR SLAM and localization is a fierce defense of view-based maps (pose graphs with time-stamped sensor readings) as the fundamental representation of maps. As will be shown, they allow for the greatest flexibility, enabling the posterior generation of arbitrary metric maps optimized for particular tasks, e.g. obstacle avoidance, real-time localization. Moreover, this work introduces a new framework in which mapping pipelines can be defined without coding, defining the connections of a network of reusable blocks much like deep-learning networks are designed by connecting layers of standardized elements. We also introduce tightly-coupled estimation of linear and angular velocity vectors within the Iterative Closest Point (ICP)-like optimizer, leading to superior robustness against aggressive motion profiles without the need for an IMU. Extensive experimental validation reveals that the proposal compares well to, or improves, former state-of-the-art (SOTA) LiDAR odometry systems, while also successfully mapping some hard sequences where others diverge. A proposed self-adaptive configuration has been used, without parameter changes, for all 3D LiDAR datasets with sensors between 16 and 128 rings, and has been extensively tested on 83 sequences over more than 250~km of automotive, hand-held, airborne, and quadruped LiDAR datasets, both indoors and outdoors. The system flexibility is demonstrated with additional configurations for 2D LiDARs and for building 3D NDT-like maps.

| **[UA-MPC: Uncertainty-Aware Model Predictive Control for Motorized LiDAR Odometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13873v1)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and comprehensive 3D sensing using LiDAR systems is crucial for various applications in photogrammetry and robotics, including facility inspection, Building Information Modeling (BIM), and robot navigation. Motorized LiDAR systems can expand the Field of View (FoV) without adding multiple scanners, but existing motorized LiDAR systems often rely on constant-speed motor control, leading to suboptimal performance in complex environments. To address this, we propose UA-MPC, an uncertainty-aware motor control strategy that balances scanning accuracy and efficiency. By predicting discrete observabilities of LiDAR Odometry (LO) through ray tracing and modeling their distribution with a surrogate function, UA-MPC efficiently optimizes motor speed control according to different scenes. Additionally, we develop a ROS-based realistic simulation environment for motorized LiDAR systems, enabling the evaluation of control strategies across diverse scenarios. Extensive experiments, conducted on both simulated and real-world scenarios, demonstrate that our method significantly improves odometry accuracy while preserving the scanning efficiency of motorized LiDAR systems. Specifically, it achieves over a 60\% reduction in positioning error with less than a 2\% decrease in efficiency compared to constant-speed control, offering a smarter and more effective solution for active 3D sensing tasks.

| **[A Real-time Degeneracy Sensing and Compensation Method for Enhanced LiDAR SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07513v1)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR is widely used in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and autonomous driving. The LiDAR odometry is of great importance in multi-sensor fusion. However, in some unstructured environments, the point cloud registration cannot constrain the poses of the LiDAR due to its sparse geometric features, which leads to the degeneracy of multi-sensor fusion accuracy. To address this problem, we propose a novel real-time approach to sense and compensate for the degeneracy of LiDAR. Firstly, this paper introduces the degeneracy factor with clear meaning, which can measure the degeneracy of LiDAR. Then, the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) clustering method adaptively perceives the degeneracy with better environmental generalization. Finally, the degeneracy perception results are utilized to fuse LiDAR and IMU, thus effectively resisting degeneracy effects. Experiments on our dataset show the method's high accuracy and robustness and validate our algorithm's adaptability to different environments and LiDAR scanning modalities.</p></details> | 13 pages |
| **[Adaptive LiDAR Odometry and Mapping for Autonomous Agricultural Mobile Robots in Unmanned Farms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02899v1)** | 2024-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unmanned and intelligent agricultural systems are crucial for enhancing agricultural efficiency and for helping mitigate the effect of labor shortage. However, unlike urban environments, agricultural fields impose distinct and unique challenges on autonomous robotic systems, such as the unstructured and dynamic nature of the environment, the rough and uneven terrain, and the resulting non-smooth robot motion. To address these challenges, this work introduces an adaptive LiDAR odometry and mapping framework tailored for autonomous agricultural mobile robots operating in complex agricultural environments. The proposed framework consists of a robust LiDAR odometry algorithm based on dense Generalized-ICP scan matching, and an adaptive mapping module that considers motion stability and point cloud consistency for selective map updates. The key design principle of this framework is to prioritize the incremental consistency of the map by rejecting motion-distorted points and sparse dynamic objects, which in turn leads to high accuracy in odometry estimated from scan matching against the map. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated via extensive evaluation against state-of-the-art methods on field datasets collected in real-world agricultural environments featuring various planting types, terrain types, and robot motion profiles. Results demonstrate that our method can achieve accurate odometry estimation and mapping results consistently and robustly across diverse agricultural settings, whereas other methods are sensitive to abrupt robot motion and accumulated drift in unstructured environments. Further, the computational efficiency of our method is competitive compared with other methods. The source code of the developed method and the associated field dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/UCR-Robotics/AG-LOAM.</p></details> |  |

However, UAVs heavily rely on global navigation satellite system (GNSS) for localization which works well in open spaces, but the precision drastically degrades in the vicinity of buildings. These inaccuracies hinder aggregation of diverse data from multiple sources in a unified georeferenced frame for SAR operators. In contrast, CityGML models provide approximate building shapes with accurate georeferenced poses. Besides, LiDAR works best in the vicinity of 3D structures. Hence, we refine coarse GNSS measurements by registering LiDAR maps against CityGML and digital elevation map (DEM) models as a prior for allocentric mapping. An intuitive plausibility score selects the best hypothesis based on occupancy using a 2D height map. Afterwards, we integrate the registration results in a continuous-time spline-based pose graph optimizer with LiDAR odometry and further sensing modalities to obtain globally consistent, georeferenced trajectories and maps. We evaluate the viability of our approach on multiple flights captured at two distinct testing sites. Our method successfully reduced GNSS offset errors from up-to 16 m to below 0.5 m on multiple flights. Furthermore, we obtain globally consistent maps w.r.t. prior 3D geospatial models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at IEEE International Symposium on Safety, Security, and Rescue Robotics (SSRR), New York City, USA, November 2024</p></details> |

Existing approaches to dynamic object detection often rely on pretrained learned networks or computationally expensive volumetric maps. To enhance efficiency on computationally limited robots, we reuse data between the odometry and detection module. Utilizing a range image segmentation technique and a novel residual-based heuristic, our method distinguishes dynamic from static objects before integrating them into the point cloud map. The approach demonstrates robust object tracking and improved map accuracy in environments with numerous dynamic objects. Even highly non-rigid objects, such as running humans, are accurately detected at point level without prior downsampling of the point cloud and hence, without loss of information. Evaluation on simulated and real-world data validates its computational efficiency. Compared to a state-of-the-art volumetric method, our approach shows comparable detection performance at a fraction of the processing time, adding only 14 ms to the odometry module for dynamic object detection and tracking. The implementation and a new real-world dataset are available as open-source for further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 2024 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)</p></details> |

However, the performance of LiDAR odometry varies depending on the environment and deteriorates in degenerative environments such as long corridors. This issue stems from the dependence on a single error metric, which has different strengths and weaknesses depending on the geometrical characteristics of the surroundings. To address these problems, this study proposes a novel iterative closest point (ICP) method called GenZ-ICP. We revisited both point-to-plane and point-to-point error metrics and propose a method that leverages their strengths in a complementary manner. Moreover, adaptability to diverse environments was enhanced by utilizing an adaptive weight that is adjusted based on the geometrical characteristics of the surroundings. As demonstrated in our experimental evaluation, the proposed GenZ-ICP exhibits high adaptability to various environments and resilience to optimization degradation in corridor-like degenerative scenarios by preventing ill-posed problems during the optimization process.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, Accepted to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)</p></details> |

However, fusing these two modalities typically requires a highly accurate calibration between them. In this paper, we propose MDPCalib which is a novel method for camera-LiDAR calibration that requires neither human supervision nor any specific target objects. Instead, we utilize sensor motion estimates from visual and LiDAR odometry as well as deep learning-based 2D-pixel-to-3D-point correspondences that are obtained without in-domain retraining. We represent camera-LiDAR calibration as an optimization problem and minimize the costs induced by constraints from sensor motion and point correspondences. In extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our approach yields highly accurate extrinsic calibration parameters and is robust to random initialization. Additionally, our approach generalizes to a wide range of sensor setups, which we demonstrate by employing it on various robotic platforms including a self-driving perception car, a quadruped robot, and a UAV. To make our calibration method publicly accessible, we release the code on our project website at http://calibration.cs.uni-freiburg.de.</p></details> |  |

Particularly under conditions where the exteroceptive sensors, which the navigation depends on, can be degraded by environmental challenges thus, leading to mission failure. It is precisely in such challenges where the potential for FMCW radar sensors is highlighted: as a complementary exteroceptive sensing modality with direct velocity measuring capabilities. In this work we integrate radial speed measurements from a FMCW radar sensor, using a radial speed factor, to provide linear velocity updates into a sliding-window state estimator for fusion with LiDAR pose and IMU measurements. We demonstrate that this augmentation increases the robustness of the state estimator to challenging conditions present in the environment and the negative effects they can pose to vulnerable exteroceptive modalities. The proposed method is extensively evaluated using robotic field experiments conducted using an autonomous, full-scale, off-road vehicle operating at high-speeds (~12 m/s) in complex desert environments.

However, existing methods mostly rely on some implicit or heuristic features of the environment, which can still fail to work in common environments such as corridors, tunnels, and warehouses. Indeed, navigating in such featureless, degenerative, and repetitive (FDR) environments would also pose a significant challenge even for humans, but explicit text cues in the surroundings often provide the best assistance. This inspires us to propose a multi-modal loop closure method based on explicit human-readable textual cues in FDR environments. Specifically, our approach first extracts scene text entities based on Optical Character Recognition (OCR), then creates a local map of text cues based on accurate LiDAR odometry and finally identifies loop closure events by a graph-theoretic scheme. Experiment results demonstrate that this approach has superior performance over existing methods that rely solely on visual and LiDAR sensors.

Our method flexibly adjusts the temporal intervals between control nodes according to the dynamics of motion and environmental characteristics. This adaptability enhances performance across various motion states and improves robustness in challenging, feature-sparse environments.

| **[TRLO: An Efficient LiDAR Odometry with 3D Dynamic Object Tracking and Removal](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13240v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simultaneous state estimation and mapping is an essential capability for mobile robots working in dynamic urban environment. The majority of existing SLAM solutions heavily rely on a primarily static assumption. However, due to the presence of moving vehicles and pedestrians, this assumption does not always hold, leading to localization accuracy decreased and maps distorted. To address this challenge, we propose TRLO, a dynamic LiDAR odometry that efficiently improves the accuracy of state estimation and generates a cleaner point cloud map. To efficiently detect dynamic objects in the surrounding environment, a deep learning-based method is applied, generating detection bounding boxes. We then design a 3D multi-object tracker based on Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) and nearest neighbor (NN) strategy to reliably identify and remove dynamic objects. Subsequently, a fast two-stage iterative nearest point solver is employed to solve the state estimation using cleaned static point cloud. Note that a novel hash-based keyframe database management is proposed for fast access to search keyframes. Furthermore, all the detected object bounding boxes are leveraged to impose posture consistency constraint to further refine the final state estimation. Extensive evaluations and ablation studies conducted on the KITTI and UrbanLoco datasets demonstrate that our approach not only achieves more accurate state estimation but also generates cleaner maps, compared with baselines.</p></details> | 8pages, 5figures |
| **[C$^3$P-VoxelMap: Compact, Cumulative and Coalescible Probabilistic Voxel Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01195v2)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work presents a compact, cumulative and coalescible probabilistic voxel mapping method to enhance performance, accuracy and memory efficiency in LiDAR odometry. Probabilistic voxel mapping requires storing past point clouds and re-iterating on them to update the uncertainty every iteration, which consumes large memory space and CPU cycles. To solve this problem, we propose a two-folded strategy. First, we introduce a compact point-free representation for probabilistic voxels and derive a cumulative update of the planar uncertainty without caching original point clouds. Our voxel structure only keeps track of a predetermined set of statistics for points that lie inside it. This method reduces the runtime complexity from $O(MN)$ to $O(N)$ and the space complexity from $O(N)$ to $O(1)$ where $M$ is the number of iterations and $N$ is the number of points. Second, to further minimize memory usage and enhance mapping accuracy, we provide a strategy to dynamically merge voxels associated with the same physical planes by taking advantage of the geometric features in the real world. Rather than scanning for these coalescible voxels constantly at every iteration, our merging strategy accumulates voxels in a locality-sensitive hash and triggers merging lazily. On-demand merging not only reduces memory footprint with minimal computational overhead but also improves localization accuracy thanks to cross-voxel denoising. Experiments exhibit 20% higher accuracy, 20% faster performance and 70% lower memory consumption than the state-of-the-art.</p></details> |  |

Current SLAM systems can achieve centimeter-level accuracy within a short period. However, there are still several challenges when dealing with largescale mapping tasks including significant storage requirements and difficulty of reusing the constructed maps. To address this, we first design an elastic and lightweight map representation called CELLmap, composed of several CELLs, each representing the local map at the corresponding location. Then, we design a general backend including CELL-based bidirectional registration module and loop closure detection module to improve global map consistency. Our experiments have demonstrated that CELLmap can represent the precise geometric structure of large-scale maps of KITTI dataset using only about 60 MB. Additionally, our general backend achieves up to a 26.88% improvement over various LiDAR odometry methods.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |

First, an adaptive submap joining strategy is employed to generate prior submaps (keyframes and poses) for the central session, and to provide priors for subsidiaries when constraints are needed for robust localization. Next, a coarse-to-fine pose initialization for subsidiary sessions is performed using vertical recognition and ICP refinement in the global coordinate frame. To elevate the accuracy of subsequent localization, we propose an egocentric factor graph (EFG) module that integrates the IMU preintegration, LiDAR odometry and scan match factors in a joint optimization manner. Specifically, the scan match factors are constructed by a novel propagation model that efficiently distributes the prior constrains as edges to the relevant prior pose nodes, weighted by noises based on keyframe registration errors. Additionally, the framework supports flexible switching between two modes: relocalization (RLM) and incremental localization (ILM) based on the proposed overlap-based mechanism to select or update the prior submaps from central session. The proposed LiLoc is tested on public and custom datasets, demonstrating accurate localization performance against state-of-the-art methods.

It consists of a pyramid structure with a spatial information reuse strategy, a sequential pose initialization module, a gated hierarchical pose refinement module, and a temporal feature propagation module. First, spatial features are encoded using a point feature pyramid, with features reused in successive pose estimations to reduce computational overhead. Second, a sequential pose initialization method is introduced, leveraging the high-frequency sampling characteristic of LiDAR to initialize the LiDAR pose. Then, a gated hierarchical pose refinement mechanism refines poses from coarse to fine by selectively retaining or discarding motion information from different layers based on gate estimations. Finally, temporal feature propagation is proposed to incorporate the historical motion information from point cloud sequences, and address the spatial inconsistency issue when transmitting motion information embedded in point clouds between frames. Experimental results on the KITTI odometry dataset and Argoverse dataset demonstrate that DSLO outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving at least a 15.67\% improvement on RTE and a 12.64\% improvement on RRE, while also achieving a 34.69\% reduction in runtime compared to baseline methods.

Mesh maps represent a dense and continuous map format with low memory consumption, which can approximate complex structures with simple elements, attracting significant attention of researchers in recent years. However, most implementations operate under a static environment assumption. In effect, moving objects cause ghosting, potentially degrading the quality of meshing. To address these issues, we propose a plug-and-play meshing module adapting to dynamic environments, which can easily integrate with various LiDAR odometry to generally improve the pose estimation accuracy of odometry. In our meshing module, a novel two-stage coarse-to-fine dynamic removal method is designed to effectively filter dynamic objects, generating consistent, accurate, and dense mesh maps. To our best know, this is the first mesh construction method with explicit dynamic removal. Additionally, conducive to Gaussian process in mesh construction, sliding window-based keyframe aggregation and adaptive downsampling strategies are used to ensure the uniformity of point cloud. We evaluate the localization and mapping accuracy on five publicly available datasets. Both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate the superiority of our method compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms.

Sensors are often corrupted in those complicated and large-scale environments. This paper introduces GNSS-FGO, an online and global trajectory estimator that fuses GNSS observations alongside multiple sensor measurements for robust vehicle localization. In GNSS-FGO, we fuse asynchronous sensor measurements into the graph with a continuous-time trajectory representation using Gaussian process regression. This enables querying states at arbitrary timestamps so that sensor observations are fused without requiring strict state and measurement synchronization. Thus, the proposed method presents a generalized factor graph for multi-sensor fusion. To evaluate and study different GNSS fusion strategies, we fuse GNSS measurements in loose and tight coupling with a speed sensor, IMU, and lidar-odometry. We employed datasets from measurement campaigns in Aachen, Duesseldorf, and Cologne in experimental studies and presented comprehensive discussions on sensor observations, smoother types, and hyperparameter tuning. Our results show that the proposed approach enables robust trajectory estimation in dense urban areas, where the classic multi-sensor fusion method fails due to sensor degradation. In a test sequence containing a 17km route through Aachen, the proposed method results in a mean 2D positioning error of 0.48m while fusing raw GNSS observations with lidar odometry in a tight coupling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the IEEE Transactions on Robotics</p></details> |

However, it remains challenging to explore effective visual-LiDAR fusion, mainly due to the intrinsic data structure inconsistency between two modalities: Image pixels are regular and dense, but LiDAR points are unordered and sparse. To address the problem, we propose a local-to-global fusion network (DVLO) with bi-directional structure alignment. To obtain locally fused features, we project points onto the image plane as cluster centers and cluster image pixels around each center. Image pixels are pre-organized as pseudo points for image-to-point structure alignment. Then, we convert points to pseudo images by cylindrical projection (point-to-image structure alignment) and perform adaptive global feature fusion between point features and local fused features. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on KITTI odometry and FlyingThings3D scene flow datasets compared to both single-modal and multi-modal methods.

Traditional methods for dynamic object detection rely on high accuracy odometry and maps to detect and track moving objects. However, these methods are not suitable for long-term operation in dynamic environments where the surrounding environment is constantly changing. In order to solve this problem, we propose a novel system for detecting and tracking dynamic objects in real-time using only LiDAR data. By emphasizing the extraction of low-frequency components from LiDAR data as feature points for foreground objects, our method significantly reduces the time required for object clustering and movement analysis. Additionally, we have developed a tracking approach that employs intensity-based ego-motion estimation along with a sliding window technique to assess object movements. This enables the precise identification of moving objects and enhances the system's resilience to odometry drift. Our experiments show that this system can detect and track dynamic objects in real-time with an average detection accuracy of 88.7\% and a recall rate of 89.1\%. Furthermore, our system demonstrates resilience against the prolonged drift typically associated with front-end only LiDAR odometry.

However, most of the current works focus on nonlinear optimization methods, and still existing many challenges in using the traditional Iterative Extended Kalman Filter (IEKF) framework to tackle the problem: IEKF only iterates over the observation equation, relying on a rough estimate of the initial state, which is insufficient to fully eliminate motion distortion in the input point cloud; the system process noise is difficult to be determined during state estimation of the complex motions; and the varying motion models across different sensor carriers. To address these issues, we propose the Dual-Iteration Extended Kalman Filter (I2EKF) and the LiDAR odometry based on I2EKF (I2EKF-LO). This approach not only iterates over the observation equation but also leverages state updates to iteratively mitigate motion distortion in LiDAR point clouds. Moreover, it dynamically adjusts process noise based on the confidence level of prior predictions during state estimation and establishes motion models for different sensor carriers to achieve accurate and efficient state estimation. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that I2EKF-LO achieves outstanding levels of accuracy and computational efficiency in the realm of LiDAR odometry. Additionally, to foster community development, our code is open-sourced.https://github.com/YWL0720/I2EKF-LO.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IROS 2024</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose a SLAM system for building globally consistent maps, called PIN-SLAM, that is based on an elastic and compact point-based implicit neural map representation. Taking range measurements as input, our approach alternates between incremental learning of the local implicit signed distance field and the pose estimation given the current local map using a correspondence-free, point-to-implicit model registration. Our implicit map is based on sparse optimizable neural points, which are inherently elastic and deformable with the global pose adjustment when closing a loop. Loops are also detected using the neural point features. Extensive experiments validate that PIN-SLAM is robust to various environments and versatile to different range sensors such as LiDAR and RGB-D cameras. PIN-SLAM achieves pose estimation accuracy better or on par with the state-of-the-art LiDAR odometry or SLAM systems and outperforms the recent neural implicit SLAM approaches while maintaining a more consistent, and highly compact implicit map that can be reconstructed as accurate and complete meshes. Finally, thanks to the voxel hashing for efficient neural points indexing and the fast implicit map-based registration without closest point association, PIN-SLAM can run at the sensor frame rate on a moderate GPU. Codes will be available at: https://github.com/PRBonn/PIN_SLAM.</p></details> | 20 pages |
| **[Attention-Guided Lidar Segmentation and Odometry Using Image-to-Point Cloud Saliency Transfer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14332v2)** | 2024-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR odometry estimation and 3D semantic segmentation are crucial for autonomous driving, which has achieved remarkable advances recently. However, these tasks are challenging due to the imbalance of points in different semantic categories for 3D semantic segmentation and the influence of dynamic objects for LiDAR odometry estimation, which increases the importance of using representative/salient landmarks as reference points for robust feature learning. To address these challenges, we propose a saliency-guided approach that leverages attention information to improve the performance of LiDAR odometry estimation and semantic segmentation models. Unlike in the image domain, only a few studies have addressed point cloud saliency information due to the lack of annotated training data. To alleviate this, we first present a universal framework to transfer saliency distribution knowledge from color images to point clouds, and use this to construct a pseudo-saliency dataset (i.e. FordSaliency) for point clouds. Then, we adopt point cloud-based backbones to learn saliency distribution from pseudo-saliency labels, which is followed by our proposed SalLiDAR module. SalLiDAR is a saliency-guided 3D semantic segmentation model that integrates saliency information to improve segmentation performance. Finally, we introduce SalLONet, a self-supervised saliency-guided LiDAR odometry network that uses the semantic and saliency predictions of SalLiDAR to achieve better odometry estimation. Our extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed SalLiDAR and SalLONet models achieve state-of-the-art performance against existing methods, highlighting the effectiveness of image-to-LiDAR saliency knowledge transfer.

Notably, existing calibration methods derive calibration parameters under the assumption that the methods require full motion in all axes. When IMU and LiDAR are mounted on a ground robot the motion of which is restricted to planar motion, existing calibration methods are likely to exhibit degraded performance. To address this issue, we present GRIL-Calib: a novel targetless Ground Robot IMU-LiDAR Calibration method. Our proposed method leverages ground information to compensate for the lack of unrestricted full motion. First, we propose LiDAR Odometry (LO) using ground plane residuals to enhance calibration accuracy. Second, we propose the Ground Plane Motion (GPM) constraint and incorporate it into the optimization for calibration, enabling the determination of full 6-DoF extrinsic parameters, including theoretically unobservable direction. Finally, unlike baseline methods, we formulate the calibration not as sequential two optimizations but as a single optimization (SO) problem, solving all calibration parameters simultaneously and improving accuracy. We validate our GRIL-Calib by applying it to various real-world datasets and comparing its performance with that of existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and robustness.

This problem has been addressed by the community for more than two decades, and many effective solutions are available nowadays. Most of these systems implicitly rely on assumptions about the operating environment, the sensor used, and motion pattern. When these assumptions are violated, several well-known systems tend to perform poorly. This paper presents a LiDAR odometry system that can overcome these limitations and operate well under different operating conditions while achieving performance comparable with domain-specific methods. Our algorithm follows the well-known ICP paradigm that leverages a PCA-based kd-tree implementation that is used to extract structural information about the clouds being registered and to compute the minimization metric for the alignment. The drift is bound by managing the local map based on the estimated uncertainty of the tracked pose. To benefit the community, we release an open-source C++ anytime real-time implementation.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/rvp-group/mad-icp</p></details> |

Understanding the semantics of the surrounding environment and accurate vehicle pose estimation are essential capabilities for autonomous vehicles, including self-driving cars and mobile robots that perform complex tasks. Fast moving platforms like self-driving cars impose a hard challenge for localization and mapping algorithms. In this work, we propose a novel framework for real-time LiDAR odometry and mapping based on LOAM architecture for fast moving platforms. Our framework utilizes semantic information produced by a deep learning model to improve point-to-line and point-to-plane matching between LiDAR scans and build a semantic map of the environment, leading to more accurate motion estimation using LiDAR data. We observe that including semantic information in the matching process introduces a new type of outlier matches to the process, where matching occur between different objects of the same semantic class. To this end, we propose a novel algorithm that explicitly identifies and discards potential outliers in the matching process. In our experiments, we study the effect of improving the matching process on the robustness of LiDAR odometry against high speed motion. Our experimental evaluations on KITTI dataset demonstrate that utilizing semantic information and rejecting outliers significantly enhance the robustness of LiDAR odometry and mapping when there are large gaps between scan acquisition poses, which is typical for fast moving platforms.</p></details> |  |

In the existing works, iterative closest point (ICP) is widely used since it is precise and efficient. Due to its non-convexity and its local iterative strategy, however, ICP-based method easily falls into local optima, which in turn calls for a precise initialization. In this paper, we propose CoFi, a Coarse-to-Fine ICP algorithm for LiDAR localization. Specifically, the proposed algorithm down-samples the input point sets under multiple voxel resolution, and gradually refines the transformation from the coarse point sets to the fine-grained point sets. In addition, we propose a map based LiDAR localization algorithm that extracts semantic feature points from the LiDAR frames and apply CoFi to estimate the pose on an efficient point cloud map. With the help of the Cylinder3D algorithm for LiDAR scan semantic segmentation, the proposed CoFi localization algorithm demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance on the KITTI odometry benchmark, with significant improvement over the literature.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revis...</summary><p>Revise to new article</p></details> |

To address the issue of LiDAR odometry drift in high-noise settings, integrating clustering methods to filter out unstable features has become an effective module of SLAM frameworks. However, reducing the amount of point cloud data can lead to potential loss of information and possible degeneration. As a result, this research proposes a LiDAR odometry that can dynamically assess the point cloud's reliability. The algorithm aims to improve adaptability in diverse settings by selecting important feature points with sensitivity to the level of environmental degeneration. Firstly, a fast adaptive Euclidean clustering algorithm based on range image is proposed, which, combined with depth clustering, extracts the primary structural points of the environment defined as ambient skeleton points. Then, the environmental degeneration level is computed through the dense normal features of the skeleton points, and the point cloud cleaning is dynamically adjusted accordingly. The algorithm is validated on the KITTI benchmark and real environments, demonstrating higher accuracy and robustness in different environments.</p></details> |  |

Lidar scan matching, which is used in dead reckoning (also known as lidar odometry) and mapping, computes the rotation and translation that best align a pair of point clouds. Perspective errors occur when a scene is viewed from different angles, with different surfaces becoming visible or occluded from each viewpoint. To explain perspective anomalies observed in data, this paper models perspective errors for two objects representative of urban landscapes: a cylindrical column and a dual-wall corner. For each object, we provide an analytical model of the perspective error for voxel-based lidar scan matching. We then analyze how perspective errors accumulate as a lidar-equipped vehicle moves past these objects.</p></details> |  |

As is known, 2D feature extraction and matching have already achieved great success. Unfortunately, in the field of 3D, the current methods may fail to support the extensive application of 3D LiDAR sensors in robotic vision tasks due to their poor descriptiveness and inefficiency. To address this limitation, we propose a novel 3D feature representation method: Linear Keypoints representation for 3D LiDAR point cloud, called LinK3D. The novelty of LinK3D lies in that it fully considers the characteristics (such as the sparsity and complexity) of LiDAR point clouds and represents the keypoint with its robust neighbor keypoints, which provide strong constraints in the description of the keypoint. The proposed LinK3D has been evaluated on three public datasets, and the experimental results show that our method achieves great matching performance. More importantly, LinK3D also shows excellent real-time performance, faster than the sensor frame rate at 10 Hz of a typical rotating LiDAR sensor. LinK3D only takes an average of 30 milliseconds to extract features from the point cloud collected by a 64-beam LiDAR and takes merely about 20 milliseconds to match two LiDAR scans when executed on a computer with an Intel Core i7 processor. Moreover, our method can be extended to LiDAR odometry task, and shows good scalability. We release the implementation of our method at https://github.com/YungeCui/LinK3D.</p></details> |  |

The main goal of odometry is to predict the robot's motion and accurately determine its current location.

LiDAR, in particular, has gained attention for its ability to provide rich three-dimensional (3D) data and immunity to light variations. This survey aims to examine advancements in LiDAR odometry thoroughly. We start by exploring LiDAR technology and then scrutinize LiDAR odometry works, categorizing them based on their sensor integration approaches. These approaches include methods relying solely on LiDAR, those combining LiDAR with IMU, strategies involving multiple LiDARs, and methods fusing LiDAR with other sensor modalities.

In this study, we propose a novel LiDAR odometry which effectively utilizes the overall exterior characteristics of environmental landmarks. The vehicle pose estimation is accomplished by means of two sequential pose estimation stages, namely, horizontal pose estimation and vertical pose estimation. To achieve effective landmark registration, a comprehensive index is proposed to evaluate the level of similarity between landmarks. This index takes into account two crucial aspects of landmarks, namely, dimension and shape in evaluating their similarity. To assess the performance of the proposed algorithm, we utilize the widely recognized KITTI dataset as well as experimental data collected by an unmanned ground vehicle platform. Both graphical and numerical results indicate that our algorithm outperforms leading LiDAR odometry solutions in terms of positioning accuracy.</p></details> |  |

They are usually sensitive to noise. To overcome these limitations, we propose a real-time mesh-based LiDAR odometry and mapping approach for large-scale scenes via implicit reconstruction and a parallel spatial-hashing scheme. To efficiently reconstruct triangular meshes, we suggest an incremental voxel meshing method that updates every scan by traversing each point once and compresses space via a scalable partition module. By taking advantage of rapid accessing triangular meshes at any time, we design point-to-mesh odometry with location and feature-based data association to estimate the poses between the incoming point clouds and the recovered triangular meshes. The experimental results on four datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach in generating accurate motion trajectories and environmental mesh maps.</p></details> |  |

Many extension works on LOAM mainly leverage one specific constraint to improve the performance, e.g., information from on-board sensors such as loop closure and inertial state; prior conditions such as ground level and motion dynamics. In many robotic applications, these conditions are often known partially, hence a SLAM system can be a comprehensive problem due to the existence of numerous constraints. Therefore, we can achieve a better SLAM result by fusing them properly. In this paper, we propose a hybrid LiDAR-inertial SLAM framework that leverages both the on-board perception system and prior information such as motion dynamics to improve localization performance. In particular, we consider the case for ground vehicles, which are commonly used for autonomous driving and warehouse logistics. We present a computationally efficient LiDAR-inertial odometry method that directly parameterizes ground vehicle poses on SE(2). The out-of-SE(2) motion perturbations are not neglected but incorporated into an integrated noise term of a novel SE(2)-constraints model. For odometric measurement processing, we propose a versatile, tightly coupled LiDAR-inertial odometry to achieve better pose estimation than traditional LiDAR odometry. Thorough experiments are performed to evaluate our proposed method's performance in different scenarios, including localization for both indoor and outdoor environments. The proposed method achieves superior performance in accuracy and robustness.</p></details> |  |

This substantially reduces computation time and the required features for odometry estimation in LOAM-based algorithms. Our odometry estimation method does not rely on global maps or loop closure algorithms, which further reduces computational costs. Experimental results generate a translation and rotation error of 0.86\% and 0.0036{\deg}/m on the KITTI dataset with an average runtime of 78ms.

However, there are several challenges for these new LiDAR sensors, including small field of view, severe motion distortions, and irregular patterns, which hinder them from being widely used in LiDAR odometry, practically. To tackle these problems, we present an effective continuous-time LiDAR odometry (ECTLO) method for the Risley-prism-based LiDARs with non-repetitive scanning patterns. A single range image covering historical points in LiDAR's small FoV is adopted for efficient map representation. To account for the noisy data from occlusions after map updating, a filter-based point-to-plane Gaussian Mixture Model is used for robust registration. Moreover, a LiDAR-only continuous-time motion model is employed to relieve the inevitable distortions. Extensive experiments have been conducted on various testbeds using the prism-based LiDARs with different scanning patterns, whose promising results demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures.

In this article, we propose a novel approach to improve the accuracy of visual localization using Structure from Motion (SfM) techniques. We highlight the limitations of global SfM, which suffers from high latency, and the challenges of local SfM, which requires large image databases for accurate reconstruction. To address these issues, we propose utilizing Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), as opposed to image databases, to cut down on the space required for storage. We suggest that sampling reference images around the prior query position can lead to further improvements. We evaluate the accuracy of our proposed method against ground truth obtained using LIDAR and Advanced Lidar Odometry and Mapping in Real-time (A-LOAM), and compare its storage usage against local SfM with COLMAP in the conducted experiments. Our proposed method achieves an accuracy of 0.068 meters compared to the ground truth, which is slightly lower than the most advanced method COLMAP, which has an accuracy of 0.022 meters. However, the size of the database required for COLMAP is 400 megabytes, whereas the size of our NeRF model is only 160 megabytes. Finally, we perform an ablation study to assess the impact of using reference images from the NeRF reconstruction.</p></details> |  |

Reliability and efficiency are the two most valued features for applying SLAM in robot applications. In this paper, we consider achieving a reliable LiDAR-based SLAM function in computation-limited platforms, such as quadrotor UAVs based on graph-based point cloud association. First, contrary to most works selecting salient features for point cloud registration, we propose a non-conspicuous feature selection strategy for reliability and robustness purposes. Then a two-stage correspondence selection method is used to register the point cloud, which includes a KD-tree-based coarse matching followed by a graph-based matching method that uses geometric consistency to vote out incorrect correspondences. Additionally, we propose an odometry approach where the weight optimizations are guided by vote results from the aforementioned geometric consistency graph. In this way, the optimization of LiDAR odometry rapidly converges and evaluates a fairly accurate transformation resulting in the back-end module efficiently finishing the mapping task. Finally, we evaluate our proposed framework on the KITTI odometry dataset and real-world environments. Experiments show that our SLAM system achieves a comparative level or higher level of accuracy with more balanced computation efficiency compared with the mainstream LiDAR-based SLAM solutions.</p></details> |  |

Existing learning-based 3D descriptors and keypoint detectors are either independent or loosely coupled, so they cannot fully adapt to each other. In this work, we propose a tightly coupled keypoint detector and descriptor (TCKDD) based on a multi-task fully convolutional network with a probabilistic detection loss. In particular, this self-supervised detection loss fully adapts the keypoint detector to any jointly learned descriptors and benefits the self-supervised learning of descriptors. Extensive experiments on both indoor and outdoor datasets show that our TCKDD achieves state-of-the-art performance in point cloud registration. Furthermore, we design a keypoint detector and descriptors-assisted LiDAR odometry and mapping framework (KDD-LOAM), whose real-time odometry relies on keypoint descriptor matching-based RANSAC. The sparse keypoints are further used for efficient scan-to-map registration and mapping. Experiments on KITTI dataset demonstrate that KDD-LOAM significantly surpasses LOAM and shows competitive performance in odometry.</p></details> |  |

Unlike the mainstreamed approaches that focus on improving the accuracy by the additional inertial sensors, this letter explores the capability of LiDAR-only odometry through a continuous-time perspective. Firstly, the measurements of LiDAR are regarded as streaming points continuously captured at high frequency. Secondly, the LiDAR movement is parameterized by a simple yet effective continuous-time trajectory. Therefore, our proposed Traj-LO approach tries to recover the spatial-temporal consistent movement of LiDAR by tightly coupling the geometric information from LiDAR points and kinematic constraints from trajectory smoothness. This framework is generalized for different kinds of LiDAR as well as multi-LiDAR systems. Extensive experiments on the public datasets demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of our proposed LiDAR-only approach, even in scenarios where the kinematic state exceeds the IMU's measuring range. Our implementation is open-sourced on GitHub.</p></details> | <details><summary>Video...</summary><p>Video https://youtu.be/hbtKzElYKkQ?si=3KEVy0hlHBsKV8j0 and Project site https://github.com/kevin2431/Traj-LO</p></details> |
| **[LiDAR-Generated Images Derived Keypoints Assisted Point Cloud Registration Scheme in Odometry Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10436v1)** | 2023-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Keypoint detection and description play a pivotal role in various robotics and autonomous applications including visual odometry (VO), visual navigation, and Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). While a myriad of keypoint detectors and descriptors have been extensively studied in conventional camera images, the effectiveness of these techniques in the context of LiDAR-generated images, i.e. reflectivity and ranges images, has not been assessed. These images have gained attention due to their resilience in adverse conditions such as rain or fog. Additionally, they contain significant textural information that supplements the geometric information provided by LiDAR point clouds in the point cloud registration phase, especially when reliant solely on LiDAR sensors. This addresses the challenge of drift encountered in LiDAR Odometry (LO) within geometrically identical scenarios or where not all the raw point cloud is informative and may even be misleading. This paper aims to analyze the applicability of conventional image key point extractors and descriptors on LiDAR-generated images via a comprehensive quantitative investigation. Moreover, we propose a novel approach to enhance the robustness and reliability of LO. After extracting key points, we proceed to downsample the point cloud, subsequently integrating it into the point cloud registration phase for the purpose of odometry estimation. Our experiment demonstrates that the proposed approach has comparable accuracy but reduced computational overhead, higher odometry publishing rate, and even superior performance in scenarios prone to drift by using the raw point cloud. This, in turn, lays a foundation for subsequent investigations into the integration of LiDAR-generated images with LO.

In this paper, we propose onlineFGO, a novel time-centric graph-optimization-based localization method that fuses multiple sensor measurements with the continuous-time trajectory representation for vehicle localization tasks. We generalize the graph construction independent of any spatial sensor measurements by creating the states deterministically on time. As the trajectory representation in continuous-time enables querying states at arbitrary times, incoming sensor measurements can be factorized on the graph without requiring state alignment. We integrate different GNSS observations: pseudorange, deltarange, and time-differenced carrier phase (TDCP) to ensure global reference and fuse the relative motion from a LiDAR-odometry to improve the localization consistency while GNSS observations are not available. Experiments on general performance, effects of different factors, and hyper-parameter settings are conducted in a real-world measurement campaign in Aachen city that contains different urban scenarios. Our results show an average 2D error of 0.99m and consistent state estimation in urban scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>A maj...</summary><p>A major revision of this paper is available, which will be submitted to arXiv later</p></details> |
| **[A LiDAR-Inertial SLAM Tightly-Coupled with Dropout-Tolerant GNSS Fusion for Autonomous Mine Service Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11492v1)** | 2023-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-modal sensor integration has become a crucial prerequisite for the real-world navigation systems. Recent studies have reported successful deployment of such system in many fields. However, it is still challenging for navigation tasks in mine scenes due to satellite signal dropouts, degraded perception, and observation degeneracy. To solve this problem, we propose a LiDAR-inertial odometry method in this paper, utilizing both Kalman filter and graph optimization. The front-end consists of multiple parallel running LiDAR-inertial odometries, where the laser points, IMU, and wheel odometer information are tightly fused in an error-state Kalman filter. Instead of the commonly used feature points, we employ surface elements for registration. The back-end construct a pose graph and jointly optimize the pose estimation results from inertial, LiDAR odometry, and global navigation satellite system (GNSS). Since the vehicle has a long operation time inside the tunnel, the largely accumulated drift may be not fully by the GNSS measurements. We hereby leverage a loop closure based re-initialization process to achieve full alignment. In addition, the system robustness is improved through handling data loss, stream consistency, and estimation error. The experimental results show that our system has a good tolerance to the long-period degeneracy with the cooperation different LiDARs and surfel registration, achieving meter-level accuracy even for tens of minutes running during GNSS dropouts.</p></details> |  |
| **[DELO: Deep Evidential LiDAR Odometry using Partial Optimal Transport](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07153v1)** | 2023-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate, robust, and real-time LiDAR-based odometry (LO) is imperative for many applications like robot navigation, globally consistent 3D scene map reconstruction, or safe motion-planning. Though LiDAR sensor is known for its precise range measurement, the non-uniform and uncertain point sampling density induce structural inconsistencies. Hence, existing supervised and unsupervised point set registration methods fail to establish one-to-one matching correspondences between LiDAR frames. We introduce a novel deep learning-based real-time (approx. 35-40ms per frame) LO method that jointly learns accurate frame-to-frame correspondences and model's predictive uncertainty (PU) as evidence to safe-guard LO predictions. In this work, we propose (i) partial optimal transportation of LiDAR feature descriptor for robust LO estimation, (ii) joint learning of predictive uncertainty while learning odometry over driving sequences, and (iii) demonstrate how PU can serve as evidence for necessary pose-graph optimization when LO network is either under or over confident. We evaluate our method on KITTI dataset and show competitive performance, even superior generalization ability over recent state-of-the-art approaches.

| **[4DRVO-Net: Deep 4D Radar-Visual Odometry Using Multi-Modal and Multi-Scale Adaptive Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06573v1)** | 2023-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Four-dimensional (4D) radar--visual odometry (4DRVO) integrates complementary information from 4D radar and cameras, making it an attractive solution for achieving accurate and robust pose estimation. However, 4DRVO may exhibit significant tracking errors owing to three main factors: 1) sparsity of 4D radar point clouds; 2) inaccurate data association and insufficient feature interaction between the 4D radar and camera; and 3) disturbances caused by dynamic objects in the environment, affecting odometry estimation. In this paper, we present 4DRVO-Net, which is a method for 4D radar--visual odometry. This method leverages the feature pyramid, pose warping, and cost volume (PWC) network architecture to progressively estimate and refine poses. Specifically, we propose a multi-scale feature extraction network called Radar-PointNet++ that fully considers rich 4D radar point information, enabling fine-grained learning for sparse 4D radar point clouds. To effectively integrate the two modalities, we design an adaptive 4D radar--camera fusion module (A-RCFM) that automatically selects image features based on 4D radar point features, facilitating multi-scale cross-modal feature interaction and adaptive multi-modal feature fusion. In addition, we introduce a velocity-guided point-confidence estimation module to measure local motion patterns, reduce the influence of dynamic objects and outliers, and provide continuous updates during pose refinement. We demonstrate the excellent performance of our method and the effectiveness of each module design on both the VoD and in-house datasets. Our method outperforms all learning-based and geometry-based methods for most sequences in the VoD dataset. Furthermore, it has exhibited promising performance that closely approaches that of the 64-line LiDAR odometry results of A-LOAM without mapping optimization.</p></details> | 14 pages,12 figures |
| **[LiDAR View Synthesis for Robust Vehicle Navigation Without Expert Labels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01424v2)** | 2023-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models for self-driving cars require a diverse training dataset to manage critical driving scenarios on public roads safely. This includes having data from divergent trajectories, such as the oncoming traffic lane or sidewalks. Such data would be too dangerous to collect in the real world. Data augmentation approaches have been proposed to tackle this issue using RGB images. However, solutions based on LiDAR sensors are scarce. Therefore, we propose synthesizing additional LiDAR point clouds from novel viewpoints without physically driving at dangerous positions. The LiDAR view synthesis is done using mesh reconstruction and ray casting. We train a deep learning model, which takes a LiDAR scan as input and predicts the future trajectory as output. A waypoint controller is then applied to this predicted trajectory to determine the throttle and steering labels of the ego-vehicle. Our method neither requires expert driving labels for the original nor the synthesized LiDAR sequence. Instead, we infer labels from LiDAR odometry. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in a comprehensive online evaluation and with a comparison to concurrent work. Our results show the importance of synthesizing additional LiDAR point clouds, particularly in terms of model robustness. Project page: https://jonathsch.github.io/lidar-synthesis/</p></details> |  |
| **[3D-SeqMOS: A Novel Sequential 3D Moving Object Segmentation in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09044v1)** | 2023-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For the SLAM system in robotics and autonomous driving, the accuracy of front-end odometry and back-end loop-closure detection determine the whole intelligent system performance. But the LiDAR-SLAM could be disturbed by current scene moving objects, resulting in drift errors and even loop-closure failure. Thus, the ability to detect and segment moving objects is essential for high-precision positioning and building a consistent map. In this paper, we address the problem of moving object segmentation from 3D LiDAR scans to improve the odometry and loop-closure accuracy of SLAM. We propose a novel 3D Sequential Moving-Object-Segmentation (3D-SeqMOS) method that can accurately segment the scene into moving and static objects, such as moving and static cars. Different from the existing projected-image method, we process the raw 3D point cloud and build a 3D convolution neural network for MOS task. In addition, to make full use of the spatio-temporal information of point cloud, we propose a point cloud residual mechanism using the spatial features of current scan and the temporal features of previous residual scans. Besides, we build a complete SLAM framework to verify the effectiveness and accuracy of 3D-SeqMOS. Experiments on SemanticKITTI dataset show that our proposed 3D-SeqMOS method can effectively detect moving objects and improve the accuracy of LiDAR odometry and loop-closure detection. The test results show our 3D-SeqMOS outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 12.4%. We extend the proposed method to the SemanticKITTI: Moving Object Segmentation competition and achieve the 2nd in the leaderboard, showing its effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[High Resolution Point Clouds from mmWave Radar](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.09273v2)** | 2023-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper explores a machine learning approach for generating high resolution point clouds from a single-chip mmWave radar. Unlike lidar and vision-based systems, mmWave radar can operate in harsh environments and see through occlusions like smoke, fog, and dust. Unfortunately, current mmWave processing techniques offer poor spatial resolution compared to lidar point clouds. This paper presents RadarHD, an end-to-end neural network that constructs lidar-like point clouds from low resolution radar input. Enhancing radar images is challenging due to the presence of specular and spurious reflections. Radar data also doesn't map well to traditional image processing techniques due to the signal's sinc-like spreading pattern. We overcome these challenges by training RadarHD on a large volume of raw I/Q radar data paired with lidar point clouds across diverse indoor settings. Our experiments show the ability to generate rich point clouds even in scenes unobserved during training and in the presence of heavy smoke occlusion. Further, RadarHD's point clouds are high-quality enough to work with existing lidar odometry and mapping workflows.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spoofing-Resilient LiDAR-GPS Factor Graph Localization with Chimera Authentication](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04692v1)** | 2023-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many vehicle platforms typically use sensors such as LiDAR or camera for locally-referenced navigation with GPS for globally-referenced navigation. However, due to the unencrypted nature of GPS signals, all civilian users are vulner-able to spoofing attacks, where a malicious spoofer broadcasts fabricated signals and causes the user to track a false position fix. To protect against such GPS spoofing attacks, Chips-Message Robust Authentication (Chimera) has been developed and will be tested on the Navigation Technology Satellite 3 (NTS-3) satellite being launched later this year. However, Chimera authentication is not continuously available and may not provide sufficient protection for vehicles which rely on more frequent GPS measurements. In this paper, we propose a factor graph-based state estimation framework which integrates LiDAR and GPS while simultaneously detecting and mitigating spoofing attacks experienced between consecutive Chimera authentications. Our proposed framework combines GPS pseudorange measurements with LiDAR odometry to provide a robust navigation solution. A chi-squared detector, based on pseudorange residuals, is used to detect and mitigate any potential GPS spoofing attacks. We evaluate our method using real-world LiDAR data from the KITTI dataset and simulated GPS measurements, both nominal and with spoofing. Across multiple trajectories and Monte Carlo runs, our method consistently achieves position errors under 5 m during nominal conditions, and successfully bounds positioning error to within odometry drift levels during spoofed conditions.</p></details> |  |

The proposed method is based on two popular approaches, ORB-SLAM and A-LOAM, with monocular scale correction and visual-bootstrapped LiDAR poses initialization modifications. The scale corrector calculates the proportion between the depth of image keypoints recovered by triangulation and that provided by LiDAR, using an outlier rejection process for accuracy improvement. Concerning LiDAR poses initialization, the visual odometry approach gives the initial guesses of LiDAR motions for better performance. This methodology is not only applicable to high-resolution LiDAR but can also adapt to low-resolution LiDAR. To evaluate the proposed SLAM system's robustness and accuracy, we conducted experiments on the KITTI Odometry and S3E datasets. Experimental results illustrate that our method significantly outperforms standalone ORB-SLAM2 and A-LOAM. Furthermore, regarding the accuracy of visual odometry with scale correction, our method performs similarly to the stereo-mode ORB-SLAM2.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 7 figures, 32 references</p></details> |

This adaptive nature of the weights can be helpful in situations where the noise level varies in the measurements. We test our algorithm first on the point cloud registration problem with synthetic data sets and LiDAR odometry with open source real-world data sets. We show that the existing approach needs an additional manual tuning of a residual scale parameter which our method directly learns from data and has similar or better performance. We further present the idea of decoupling scale and shape parameters to improve performance of the algorithm.

Based on the biologically inspired models mimicking boundary cells, place cells, and head direction cells, the SLAM system using LiDAR point cloud data is capable of leveraging the self-motion cues from the LiDAR odometry and the boundary cues from the LiDAR boundary cells to build a cognitive map and estimate the robot pose. Experiment results show that with the LiDAR boundary cells the proposed SLAM system greatly outperforms the camera-based brain-inspired method in both simulation and indoor environments, and is competitive with the conventional LiDAR-based SLAM methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quadric Representations for LiDAR Odometry, Mapping and Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14190v1)** | 2023-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current LiDAR odometry, mapping and localization methods leverage point-wise representations of 3D scenes and achieve high accuracy in autonomous driving tasks. However, the space-inefficiency of methods that use point-wise representations limits their development and usage in practical applications. In particular, scan-submap matching and global map representation methods are restricted by the inefficiency of nearest neighbor searching (NNS) for large-volume point clouds. To improve space-time efficiency, we propose a novel method of describing scenes using quadric surfaces, which are far more compact representations of 3D objects than conventional point clouds. In contrast to point cloud-based methods, our quadric representation-based method decomposes a 3D scene into a collection of sparse quadric patches, which improves storage efficiency and avoids the slow point-wise NNS process. Our method first segments a given point cloud into patches and fits each of them to a quadric implicit function. Each function is then coupled with other geometric descriptors of the patch, such as its center position and covariance matrix. Collectively, these patch representations fully describe a 3D scene, which can be used in place of the original point cloud and employed in LiDAR odometry, mapping and localization algorithms. We further design a novel incremental growing method for quadric representations, which eliminates the need to repeatedly re-fit quadric surfaces from the original point cloud. Extensive odometry, mapping and localization experiments on large-volume point clouds in the KITTI and UrbanLoco datasets demonstrate that our method maintains low latency and memory utility while achieving competitive, and even superior, accuracy.</p></details> |  |

However, it faces many challenges in real-world scenarios, such as the prior information about the environment being absent and poor communication among the team members. This work presents DCL-SLAM, a fully distributed collaborative LiDAR SLAM framework intended for the robotic swarm to simultaneously co-localize in an unknown environment with minimal information exchange. Based on ad-hoc wireless peer-to-peer communication (limited bandwidth and communication range), DCL-SLAM adopts the lightweight LiDAR-Iris descriptor for place recognition and does not require full connectivity among teams. DCL-SLAM includes three main parts: a replaceable single-robot front-end that produces LiDAR odometry results; a distributed loop closure module that detects inter-robot loop closures with keyframes; and a distributed back-end module that adapts distributed pose graph optimizer combined with a pairwise consistent measurement set maximization algorithm to reject spurious inter-robot loop closures. We integrate our proposed framework with diverse open-source LiDAR odometry methods to show its versatility. The proposed system is extensively evaluated on benchmarking datasets and field experiments over various scales and environments. Experimental result shows that DCL-SLAM achieves higher accuracy and lower communication bandwidth than other state-of-art multi-robot SLAM systems.

| **[NeRF-LOAM: Neural Implicit Representation for Large-Scale Incremental LiDAR Odometry and Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10709v1)** | 2023-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simultaneously odometry and mapping using LiDAR data is an important task for mobile systems to achieve full autonomy in large-scale environments. However, most existing LiDAR-based methods prioritize tracking quality over reconstruction quality. Although the recently developed neural radiance fields (NeRF) have shown promising advances in implicit reconstruction for indoor environments, the problem of simultaneous odometry and mapping for large-scale scenarios using incremental LiDAR data remains unexplored. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose a novel NeRF-based LiDAR odometry and mapping approach, NeRF-LOAM, consisting of three modules neural odometry, neural mapping, and mesh reconstruction. All these modules utilize our proposed neural signed distance function, which separates LiDAR points into ground and non-ground points to reduce Z-axis drift, optimizes odometry and voxel embeddings concurrently, and in the end generates dense smooth mesh maps of the environment. Moreover, this joint optimization allows our NeRF-LOAM to be pre-trained free and exhibit strong generalization abilities when applied to different environments. Extensive evaluations on three publicly available datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art odometry and mapping performance, as well as a strong generalization in large-scale environments utilizing LiDAR data. Furthermore, we perform multiple ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of our network design. The implementation of our approach will be made available at https://github.com/JunyuanDeng/NeRF-LOAM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimized SC-F-LOAM: Optimized Fast LiDAR Odometry and Mapping Using Scan Context](http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.04932v2)** | 2023-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR odometry can achieve accurate vehicle pose estimation for short driving range or in small-scale environments, but for long driving range or in large-scale environments, the accuracy deteriorates as a result of cumulative estimation errors. This drawback necessitates the inclusion of loop closure detection in a SLAM framework to suppress the adverse effects of cumulative errors. To improve the accuracy of pose estimation, we propose a new LiDAR-based SLAM method which uses F-LOAM as LiDAR odometry, Scan Context for loop closure detection, and GTSAM for global optimization. In our approach, an adaptive distance threshold (instead of a fixed threshold) is employed for loop closure detection, which achieves more accurate loop closure detection results. Besides, a feature-based matching method is used in our approach to compute vehicle pose transformations between loop closure point cloud pairs, instead of using the raw point cloud obtained by the LiDAR sensor, which significantly reduces the computation time. The KITTI dataset is used for verifications of our method, and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms typical LiDAR odometry/SLAM methods in the literature. Our code is made publicly available for the benefit of the community.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semantic Geometric Fusion Multi-object Tracking and Lidar Odometry in Dynamic Environment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11621v5)** | 2023-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The SLAM system based on static scene assumption will introduce huge estimation errors when moving objects appear in the field of view. This paper proposes a novel multi-object dynamic lidar odometry (MLO) based on semantic object detection technology to solve this problem. The MLO system can provide reliable localization of robot and semantic objects and build long-term static maps in complex dynamic scenes. For ego-motion estimation, we use the environment features that take semantic and geometric consistency constraints into account in the extraction process. The filtering features are robust to semantic movable and unknown dynamic objects. At the same time, a least square estimator using the semantic bounding box and object point cloud is proposed to achieve accurate and stable multi-object tracking between frames. In the mapping module, we further realize dynamic semantic object detection based on the absolute trajectory tracking list (ATTL). Then, static semantic objects and environmental features can be used to eliminate accumulated localization errors and build pure static maps. Experiments on public KITTI data sets show that the proposed system can achieve more accurate and robust tracking of the object and better real-time localization accuracy in complex scenes compared with existing technologies.</p></details> |  |
| **[3D LiDAR Aided GNSS NLOS Mitigation for Reliable GNSS-RTK Positioning in Urban Canyons](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05477v1)** | 2022-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>GNSS and LiDAR odometry are complementary as they provide absolute and relative positioning, respectively. Their integration in a loosely-coupled manner is straightforward but is challenged in urban canyons due to the GNSS signal reflections. Recent proposed 3D LiDAR-aided (3DLA) GNSS methods employ the point cloud map to identify the non-line-of-sight (NLOS) reception of GNSS signals. This facilitates the GNSS receiver to obtain improved urban positioning but not achieve a sub-meter level. GNSS real-time kinematics (RTK) uses carrier phase measurements to obtain decimeter-level positioning. In urban areas, the GNSS RTK is not only challenged by multipath and NLOS-affected measurement but also suffers from signal blockage by the building. The latter will impose a challenge in solving the ambiguity within the carrier phase measurements. In the other words, the model observability of the ambiguity resolution (AR) is greatly decreased. This paper proposes to generate virtual satellite (VS) measurements using the selected LiDAR landmarks from the accumulated 3D point cloud maps (PCM). These LiDAR-PCM-made VS measurements are tightly-coupled with GNSS pseudorange and carrier phase measurements. Thus, the VS measurements can provide complementary constraints, meaning providing low-elevation-angle measurements in the across-street directions. The implementation is done using factor graph optimization to solve an accurate float solution of the ambiguity before it is fed into LAMBDA. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been validated by the evaluation conducted on our recently open-sourced challenging dataset, UrbanNav. The result shows the fix rate of the proposed 3DLA GNSS RTK is about 30% while the conventional GNSS-RTK only achieves about 14%. In addition, the proposed method achieves sub-meter positioning accuracy in most of the data collected in challenging urban areas.</p></details> |  |
| **[DL-SLOT: Dynamic LiDAR SLAM and object tracking based on collaborative graph optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02077v1)** | 2022-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ego-pose estimation and dynamic object tracking are two critical problems for autonomous driving systems. The solutions to these problems are generally based on their respective assumptions, \ie{the static world assumption for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and the accurate ego-pose assumption for object tracking}. However, these assumptions are challenging to hold in dynamic road scenarios, where SLAM and object tracking become closely correlated. Therefore, we propose DL-SLOT, a dynamic LiDAR SLAM and object tracking method, to simultaneously address these two coupled problems. This method integrates the state estimations of both the autonomous vehicle and the stationary and dynamic objects in the environment into a unified optimization framework. First, we used object detection to identify all points belonging to potentially dynamic objects. Subsequently, a LiDAR odometry was conducted using the filtered point cloud. Simultaneously, we proposed a sliding window-based object association method that accurately associates objects according to the historical trajectories of tracked objects. The ego-states and those of the stationary and dynamic objects are integrated into the sliding window-based collaborative graph optimization. The stationary objects are subsequently restored from the potentially dynamic object set. Finally, a global pose-graph is implemented to eliminate the accumulated error. Experiments on KITTI datasets demonstrate that our method achieves better accuracy than SLAM and object tracking baseline methods. This confirms that solving SLAM and object tracking simultaneously is mutually advantageous, dramatically improving the robustness and accuracy of SLAM and object tracking in dynamic road scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 10 figures, this work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

For quadrupeds to navigate without a predefined map a priori, they must rely on SLAM approaches to localize and build the map of the environment. Despite the surge of interest and research development in SLAM and quadrupeds, there still has yet to be an open-source package that capitalizes on the onboard sensors of an affordable quadruped. This motivates the A1 SLAM package, which is an open-source ROS package that provides the Unitree A1 quadruped with real-time, high performing SLAM capabilities using the default sensors shipped with the robot. A1 SLAM solves the PoseSLAM problem using the factor graph paradigm to optimize for the poses throughout the trajectory. A major design feature of the algorithm is using a sliding window of fully connected LiDAR odometry factors. A1 SLAM has been benchmarked against Google's Cartographer and has showed superior performance especially with trajectories experiencing aggressive motion.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[BoW3D: Bag of Words for Real-Time Loop Closing in 3D LiDAR SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07473v2)** | 2022-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Loop closing is a fundamental part of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) for autonomous mobile systems. In the field of visual SLAM, bag of words (BoW) has achieved great success in loop closure. The BoW features for loop searching can also be used in the subsequent 6-DoF loop correction. However, for 3D LiDAR SLAM, the state-of-the-art methods may fail to effectively recognize the loop in real time, and usually cannot correct the full 6-DoF loop pose. To address this limitation, we present a novel Bag of Words for real-time loop closing in 3D LiDAR SLAM, called BoW3D. Our method not only efficiently recognizes the revisited loop places, but also corrects the full 6-DoF loop pose in real time. BoW3D builds the bag of words based on the 3D LiDAR feature LinK3D, which is efficient, pose-invariant and can be used for accurate point-to-point matching. We furthermore embed our proposed method into 3D LiDAR odometry system to evaluate loop closing performance. We test our method on public dataset, and compare it against other state-of-the-art algorithms. BoW3D shows better performance in terms of F1 max and extended precision scores on most scenarios. It is noticeable that BoW3D takes an average of 48 ms to recognize and correct the loops on KITTI 00 (includes 4K+ 64-ray LiDAR scans), when executed on a notebook with an Intel Core i7 @2.2 GHz processor. We release the implementation of our method here: https://github.com/YungeCui/BoW3D.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)/ICRA 2023</p></details> |

Our proposed method is generalized in that it can seamlessly fuse various local geometric shapes around points to improve the position estimation accuracy compared to the conventional LiDAR odometry and mapping (LOAM) method. To utilize continuous geometric features for LiDAR odometry estimation, we incorporate tiny neural networks into a generalized iterative closest point (GICP) algorithm. These neural networks improve the data association metric and the matching cost function using local geometric features. Experiments with the KITTI benchmark demonstrate that our proposed method reduces relative trajectory errors compared to the other LiDAR odometry estimation methods.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |
| **[WGICP: Differentiable Weighted GICP-Based Lidar Odometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09777v2)** | 2022-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel differentiable weighted generalized iterative closest point (WGICP) method applicable to general 3D point cloud data, including that from Lidar. Our method builds on differentiable generalized ICP (GICP), and we propose using the differentiable K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm to enhance differentiability. The differentiable GICP algorithm provides the gradient of output pose estimation with respect to each input point, which allows us to train a neural network to predict its importance, or weight, in estimating the correct pose. In contrast to the other ICP-based methods that use voxel-based downsampling or matching methods to reduce the computational cost, our method directly reduces the number of points used for GICP by only selecting those with the highest weights and ignoring redundant ones with lower weights. We show that our method improves both accuracy and speed of the GICP algorithm for the KITTI dataset and can be used to develop a more robust and efficient SLAM system.</p></details> | 6 pages |

The existing line of studies mostly focuses on one pass undistortion, which means undistortion for each point is conducted only once in the whole LiDAR-IMU odometry pipeline. In this paper, we propose an optimization based tightly coupled LiDAR-IMU odometry addressing iterated point-level undistortion. By jointly minimizing the cost derived from LiDAR and IMU measurements, our LiDAR-IMU odometry method performs more accurate and robust in high dynamic environment. Besides, the method characters good computation efficiency by limiting the quantity of parameters.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present a global descriptor, named Normal Distribution Descriptor (NDD), for 3D point cloud loop closure detection. The descriptor encodes both the probability density score and entropy of a point cloud as the descriptor. We also propose a fast rotation alignment process and use correlation coefficient as the similarity between descriptors. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art point cloud descriptors in both accuracy and efficency. The source code is available and can be integrated into existing LiDAR odometry and mapping (LOAM) systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[LMBAO: A Landmark Map for Bundle Adjustment Odometry in LiDAR SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08810v1)** | 2022-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR odometry is one of the essential parts of LiDAR simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). However, existing LiDAR odometry tends to match a new scan simply iteratively with previous fixed-pose scans, gradually accumulating errors. Furthermore, as an effective joint optimization mechanism, bundle adjustment (BA) cannot be directly introduced into real-time odometry due to the intensive computation of large-scale global landmarks. Therefore, this letter designs a new strategy named a landmark map for bundle adjustment odometry (LMBAO) in LiDAR SLAM to solve these problems. First, BA-based odometry is further developed with an active landmark maintenance strategy for a more accurate local registration and avoiding cumulative errors. Specifically, this paper keeps entire stable landmarks on the map instead of just their feature points in the sliding window and deletes the landmarks according to their active grade. Next, the sliding window length is reduced, and marginalization is performed to retain the scans outside the window but corresponding to active landmarks on the map, greatly simplifying the computation and improving the real-time properties. In addition, experiments on three challenging datasets show that our algorithm achieves real-time performance in outdoor driving and outperforms state-of-the-art LiDAR SLAM algorithms, including Lego-LOAM and VLOM.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 tables, 6 figures</p></details> |

In this architecture, the projection-aware representation of the 3D point cloud is proposed to organize the raw 3D point cloud into an ordered data form to achieve efficiency. The Pyramid, Warping, and Cost volume (PWC) structure for the LiDAR odometry task is built to estimate and refine the pose in a coarse-to-fine approach. A projection-aware attentive cost volume is built to directly associate two discrete point clouds and obtain embedding motion patterns. Then, a trainable embedding mask is proposed to weigh the local motion patterns to regress the overall pose and filter outlier points. The trainable pose warp-refinement module is iteratively used with embedding mask optimized hierarchically to make the pose estimation more robust for outliers. The entire architecture is holistically optimized end-to-end to achieve adaptive learning of cost volume and mask, and all operations involving point cloud sampling and grouping are accelerated by projection-aware 3D feature learning methods. The superior performance and effectiveness of our LiDAR odometry architecture are demonstrated on KITTI, M2DGR, and Argoverse datasets. Our method outperforms all recent learning-based methods and even the geometry-based approach, LOAM with mapping optimization, on most sequences of KITTI odometry dataset.

Poor synchronization performance, due to incorrect timestamping procedure, may negatively affect the algorithms' state estimation results. To provide highly accurate and precise synchronization between the sensors, we introduce an open-source hardware-software LiDAR to other sensors time synchronization system that exploits a dedicated hardware LiDAR time synchronization interface by providing emulated GNSS-clock to this interface, no physical GNSS-receiver is needed. The emulator is based on a general-purpose microcontroller and, due to concise hardware and software architecture, can be easily modified or extended for synchronization of sets of different sensors such as cameras, inertial measurement units (IMUs), wheel encoders, other LiDARs, etc. In the paper, we provide an example of such a system with synchronized LiDAR and IMU sensors. We conducted an evaluation of the sensors synchronization accuracy and precision, and state 1 microsecond performance. We compared our results with timestamping provided by ROS software and by a LiDAR inner clocking scheme to underline clear advantages over these two baseline methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE ISPCS 2022 Conference (International Symposium on Precision Clock Synchronization for Measurement, Control and Communication)</p></details> |

This paper proposes InTEn-LOAM, a low-drift and robust LiDAR odometry and mapping method that fully exploits implicit information of laser sweeps (i.e., geometric, intensity, and temporal characteristics). Scanned points are projected to cylindrical images, which facilitate the efficient and adaptive extraction of various types of features, i.e., ground, beam, facade, and reflector. We propose a novel intensity-based points registration algorithm and incorporate it into the LiDAR odometry, enabling the LO system to jointly estimate the LiDAR ego-motion using both geometric and intensity feature points. To eliminate the interference of dynamic objects, we propose a temporal-based dynamic object removal approach to filter them out before map update. Moreover, the local map is organized and downsampled using a temporal-related voxel grid filter to maintain the similarity between the current scan and the static local map. Extensive experiments are conducted on both simulated and real-world datasets. The results show that the proposed method achieves similar or better accuracy w.r.t the state-of-the-arts in normal driving scenarios and outperforms geometric-based LO in unstructured environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pseudo-LiDAR for Visual Odometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01567v1)** | 2022-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the existing methods, LiDAR odometry shows superior performance, but visual odometry is still widely used for its price advantage. Conventionally, the task of visual odometry mainly rely on the input of continuous images. However, it is very complicated for the odometry network to learn the epipolar geometry information provided by the images. In this paper, the concept of pseudo-LiDAR is introduced into the odometry to solve this problem. The pseudo-LiDAR point cloud back-projects the depth map generated by the image into the 3D point cloud, which changes the way of image representation. Compared with the stereo images, the pseudo-LiDAR point cloud generated by the stereo matching network can get the explicit 3D coordinates. Since the 6 Degrees of Freedom (DoF) pose transformation occurs in 3D space, the 3D structure information provided by the pseudo-LiDAR point cloud is more direct than the image. Compared with sparse LiDAR, the pseudo-LiDAR has a denser point cloud. In order to make full use of the rich point cloud information provided by the pseudo-LiDAR, a projection-aware dense odometry pipeline is adopted. Most previous LiDAR-based algorithms sampled 8192 points from the point cloud as input to the odometry network. The projection-aware dense odometry pipeline takes all the pseudo-LiDAR point clouds generated from the images except for the error points as the input to the network. While making full use of the 3D geometric information in the images, the semantic information in the images is also used in the odometry task. The fusion of 2D-3D is achieved in an image-only based odometry. Experiments on the KITTI dataset prove the effectiveness of our method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first visual odometry method using pseudo-LiDAR.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |

These SLAM systems are required to support accurate localization with limited computational resources. In particular, point cloud registration, i.e., the process of matching and aligning multiple LiDAR scans collected at multiple locations in a global coordinate framework, has been deemed as the bottleneck step in SLAM. In this paper, we propose a feature filtering algorithm, PFilter, that can filter out invalid features and can thus greatly alleviate this bottleneck. Meanwhile, the overall registration accuracy is also improved due to the carefully curated feature points. We integrate PFilter into the well-established scan-to-map LiDAR odometry framework, F-LOAM, and evaluate its performance on the KITTI dataset. The experimental results show that PFilter can remove about 48.4% of the points in the local feature map and reduce feature points in scan by 19.3% on average, which save 20.9% processing time per frame. In the mean time, we improve the accuracy by 9.4%.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures. Accepted for IEEE IROS 2022</p></details> |

Research indicates that diverse LiDAR points have different influences on the accuracy of pose estimation. This study aimed to select a good point set to enhance accuracy. Accordingly, the sensitivity and uncertainty of LiDAR point residuals were formulated as a fundamental basis for derivation and analysis. High-sensitivity and low -uncertainty point residual terms are preferred to achieve higher pose estimation accuracy. The proposed selection method has been theoretically proven to be capable of achieving a global statistical optimum. It was tested on artificial data and compared with the KITTI benchmark. It was also implemented in LiDAR odometry (LO) and LiDAR inertial odometry (LIO), both indoors and outdoors. The experiments revealed that utilizing selected LiDAR point residuals simultaneously enhances optimization accuracy, decreases residual terms, and guarantees real-time performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning-based Localizability Estimation for Robust LiDAR Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05698v2)** | 2022-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR-based localization and mapping is one of the core components in many modern robotic systems due to the direct integration of range and geometry, allowing for precise motion estimation and generation of high quality maps in real-time. Yet, as a consequence of insufficient environmental constraints present in the scene, this dependence on geometry can result in localization failure, happening in self-symmetric surroundings such as tunnels. This work addresses precisely this issue by proposing a neural network-based estimation approach for detecting (non-)localizability during robot operation. Special attention is given to the localizability of scan-to-scan registration, as it is a crucial component in many LiDAR odometry estimation pipelines. In contrast to previous, mostly traditional detection approaches, the proposed method enables early detection of failure by estimating the localizability on raw sensor measurements without evaluating the underlying registration optimization. Moreover, previous approaches remain limited in their ability to generalize across environments and sensor types, as heuristic-tuning of degeneracy detection thresholds is required. The proposed approach avoids this problem by learning from a collection of different environments, allowing the network to function over various scenarios. Furthermore, the network is trained exclusively on simulated data, avoiding arduous data collection in challenging and degenerate, often hard-to-access, environments. The presented method is tested during field experiments conducted across challenging environments and on two different sensor types without any modifications. The observed detection performance is on par with state-of-the-art methods after environment-specific threshold tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Scan matching, the process of estimating the rigid transformation that best aligns two point clouds, is the basis for lidar odometry, a form of dead reckoning. Lidar odometry is particularly useful when absolute sensors, like GPS, are not available. Here we propose the Iterative Closest Ellipsoidal Transform (ICET), a scan matching algorithm which provides two novel improvements over the current state-of-the-art Normal Distributions Transform (NDT). Like NDT, ICET decomposes lidar data into voxels and fits a Gaussian distribution to the points within each voxel. The first innovation of ICET reduces geometric ambiguity along large flat surfaces by suppressing the solution along those directions. The second innovation of ICET is to infer the output error covariance associated with the position and orientation transformation between successive point clouds; the error covariance is particularly useful when ICET is incorporated into a state-estimation routine such as an extended Kalman filter. We constructed a simulation to compare the performance of ICET and NDT in 2D space both with and without geometric ambiguity and found that ICET produces superior estimates while accurately predicting solution accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Tunnels present a uniquely difficult scenario: they are not only prone to GNSS signal loss, but also provide little features for visual localization due to their repetitive walls and poor lighting. These conditions degrade conventional vision-based and LiDAR-based systems, which rely on distinguishable environmental features. To address this, we propose a novel sensor fusion framework that integrates a thermal camera with a LiDAR to enable robust localization in tunnels and other perceptually degraded environments. The thermal camera provides resilience in low-light or smoke conditions, while the LiDAR delivers precise depth perception and structural awareness. By combining these sensors, our framework ensures continuous and accurate localization across diverse and dynamic environments. We use an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to fuse multi-sensor inputs, and leverages visual odometry and SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) techniques to process the sensor data, enabling robust motion estimation and mapping even in GNSS-denied environments. This fusion of sensor modalities not only enhances system resilience but also provides a scalable solution for cyber-physical systems in connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). To validate the framework, we conduct tests in a tunnel environment, simulating sensor degradation and visibility challenges. The results demonstrate that our method sustains accurate localization where standard approaches deteriorate due to the tunnels featureless geometry. The frameworks versatility makes it a promising solution for autonomous vehicles, inspection robots, and other cyber-physical systems operating in constrained, perceptually poor environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IAVVC 2025</p></details> |

While unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) are commonly used for indoor farm monitoring, their deployment in greenhouses is often constrained by infrastructure limitations, sensor placement challenges, and operational inefficiencies. To address these issues, we develop a lightweight unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with an RGB-D camera, a 3D LiDAR, and an IMU sensor. The UAV employs a LiDAR-inertial odometry algorithm for precise navigation in GNSS-denied environments and utilizes a 3D multi-object tracking algorithm to estimate the count and weight of cherry tomatoes. We evaluate the system using two dataset: one from a harvesting row and another from a growing row. In the harvesting-row dataset, the proposed system achieves 94.4\% counting accuracy and 87.5\% weight estimation accuracy within a 13.2-meter flight completed in 10.5 seconds. For the growing-row dataset, which consists of occluded unripened fruits, we qualitatively analyze tracking performance and highlight future research directions for improving perception in greenhouse with strong occlusions. Our findings demonstrate the potential of UAVs for efficient robotic yield estimation in commercial greenhouses.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 2025 ICRA workshop on field robotics</p></details> |

WR data which is automatically recorded by modern machinery equipped with Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) can enable efficient farm management decision making. Globally, farmers often rely on aged or legacy farming machinery and manual data recording, which introduces significant labor costs and increases the risk of inaccurate data input. To address this challenge, a field study in Central Japan was conducted to showcase automated data collection by retrofitting legacy farming machinery with low-cost Internet of Things (IoT) devices. For single-purpose vehicles (SPV), which only carry out single work types such as planting, LTE (Long Term Evolution) and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) units were installed to record trajectory data. For multi-purpose vehicles (MPV), such as tractors which perform multiple work types, the configuration settings of these vehicles had to include implements and attachments data. To obtain this data, industry standard LTE-GNSS Bluetooth gateways were fitted onto MPV and low-cost BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) beacons were attached to implements. After installation, over a seven-month field preparation and planting period 1,623 WR, including 421 WR for SPV and 1,120 WR for MVP, were automatically obtained. For MPV, the WR included detailed configuration settings enabling detection of the specific work types. These findings demonstrate the potential of low cost IoT GNSS devices for precision agriculture strategies to support management decisions in farming operations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Confe...</summary><p>Conference proceedings (Extended Abstract) for the 14th Asian-Pacific Federation for Information Technology in Agriculture (APFITA), 6-8 November 2024, Tsukuba, Japan</p></details> |

This paper introduces an extensive dataset comprising snapshots obtained from a low-frequency antenna that capture various generated interferences within a large-scale environment, including controlled multipath effects. Our objective is to assess the resilience of machine learning (ML) models against environmental changes, such as multipath effects, variations in interference attributes, such as interference class, bandwidth, and signal power, the accuracy of jamming device localization, and the constraints imposed by snapshot input lengths. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance of a diverse set of 129 distinct vision encoder models across all tasks. By analyzing the aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, we demonstrate the adaptability of our model in generalizing across diverse facets, thus establishing its suitability for real-world applications.

In light of this, conventional model-based positioning approaches, which rely on Gaussian error approximations, struggle to achieve precise localization under these conditions. To overcome these challenges, we put forth a novel learning-based framework, PC-DeepNet, that employs a permutation-invariant (PI) deep neural network (DNN) to estimate position corrections (PC). This approach is designed to ensure robustness against changes in the number and/or order of visible satellite measurements, a common issue in GNSS systems, while leveraging NLOS and multipath indicators as features to enhance positioning accuracy in challenging urban and sub-urban environments. To validate the performance of the proposed framework, we compare the positioning error with state-of-the-art model-based and learning-based positioning methods using two publicly available datasets. The results confirm that proposed PC-DeepNet achieves superior accuracy than existing model-based and learning-based methods while exhibiting lower computational complexity compared to previous learning-based approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 14 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

In the context of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) applications, the primary objective is to accurately monitor and classify interferences that degrade system performance in distributed environments, thereby enhancing situational awareness. To achieve this, machine learning (ML) models can be deployed on low-resource devices, ensuring minimal communication latency and preserving data privacy. The key challenge is to compress ML models while maintaining high classification accuracy. In this paper, we propose variational autoencoders (VAEs) for disentanglement to extract essential latent features that enable accurate classification of interferences. We demonstrate that the disentanglement approach can be leveraged for both data compression and data augmentation by interpolating the lower-dimensional latent representations of signal power. To validate our approach, we evaluate three VAE variants - vanilla, factorized, and conditional generative - on four distinct datasets, including two collected in controlled indoor environments and two real-world highway datasets. Additionally, we conduct extensive hyperparameter searches to optimize performance. Our proposed VAE achieves a data compression rate ranging from 512 to 8,192 and achieves an accuracy up to 99.92%.</p></details> | 7 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Towards Simple Machine Learning Baselines for GNSS RFI Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07993v2)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning research in GNSS radio frequency interference (RFI) detection often lacks a clear empirical justification for the choice of deep learning architectures over simpler machine learning approaches. In this work, we argue for a change in research direction-from developing ever more complex deep learning models to carefully assessing their real-world effectiveness in comparison to interpretable and lightweight machine learning baselines. Our findings reveal that state-of-the-art deep learning models frequently fail to outperform simple, well-engineered machine learning methods in the context of GNSS RFI detection. Leveraging a unique large-scale dataset collected by the Swiss Air Force and Swiss Air-Rescue (Rega), and preprocessed by Swiss Air Navigation Services Ltd. (Skyguide), we demonstrate that a simple baseline model achieves 91\% accuracy in detecting GNSS RFI, outperforming more complex deep learning counterparts. These results highlight the effectiveness of pragmatic solutions and offer valuable insights to guide future research in this critical application domain.</p></details> |  |

In this context, we investigate three strategies applied specifically to GNSS pseudorange observations: robust statistics for error mitigation, machine learning for faulty measurement prediction, and Bayesian inference for noise distribution approximation. Since previous studies have provided limited insight into the theoretical foundations and practical evaluations of these three methodologies within a unified problem statement (i.e., state estimation using ranging sensors), we conduct extensive experiments using real-world sensor data collected in diverse urban environments. Our goal is to examine both established techniques and newly proposed methods, thereby advancing the understanding of how to handle faulty range measurements, such as GNSS, for robust, long-term robot localization. In addition to presenting successful results, this work highlights critical observations and open questions to motivate future research in robust state estimation.</p></details> |  |

To achieve accurate positioning, vehicles typically use global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receivers to validate their absolute positions. However, GNSS-based positioning can be compromised by interference signals, necessitating the identification, classification, determination of purpose, and localization of such interference to mitigate or eliminate it. Recent approaches based on machine learning (ML) have shown superior performance in monitoring interference. However, their feasibility in real-world applications and environments has yet to be assessed. Effective implementation of ML techniques requires training datasets that incorporate realistic interference signals, including real-world noise and potential multipath effects that may occur between transmitter, receiver, and satellite in the operational area. Additionally, these datasets require reference labels. Creating such datasets is often challenging due to legal restrictions, as causing interference to GNSS sources is strictly prohibited. Consequently, the performance of ML-based methods in practical applications remains unclear. To address this gap, we describe a series of large-scale measurement campaigns conducted in real-world settings at two highway locations in Germany and the Seetal Alps in Austria, and in large-scale controlled indoor environments. We evaluate the latest supervised ML-based methods to report on their performance in real-world settings and present the applicability of pseudo-labeling for unsupervised learning. We demonstrate the challenges of combining datasets due to data discrepancies and evaluate outlier detection, domain adaptation, and data augmentation techniques to present the models' capabilities to adapt to changes in the datasets.</p></details> | 34 pages, 25 figures |

We validate the proposed learning-based models using real-world sensor data collected in diverse urban environments. Experimental results demonstrate that both models effectively handle GNSS outliers and improve state estimation performance.

While extensive research has explored 3DGS for indoor trajectory tracking using visual sensor alone or in combination with Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), its integration with GNSS for large-scale outdoor navigation remains underexplored. To address these concerns, we proposed GS-GVINS: a tightly-integrated GNSS-Visual-Inertial Navigation System augmented by 3DGS. This system leverages 3D Gaussian as a continuous differentiable scene representation in largescale outdoor environments, enhancing navigation performance through the constructed 3D Gaussian map. Notably, GS-GVINS is the first GNSS-Visual-Inertial navigation application that directly utilizes the analytical jacobians of SE3 camera pose with respect to 3D Gaussians. To maintain the quality of 3DGS rendering in extreme dynamic states, we introduce a motionaware 3D Gaussian pruning mechanism, updating the map based on relative pose translation and the accumulated opacity along the camera ray. For validation, we test our system under different driving environments: open-sky, sub-urban, and urban. Both self-collected and public datasets are used for evaluation. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of GS-GVINS in enhancing navigation accuracy across diverse driving environments.</p></details> |  |

Cross-checking the GNSS-provided time against alternative multiple trusted time sources can lead to attack detection aiming at controlling the GNSS receiver time. Leveraging external, network-connected secure time providers and onboard clock references, we achieve detection even under fine-grained time attacks. We provide an extensive evaluation of our multi-layered defense against adversaries mounting attacks against the GNSS receiver along with controlling the network link. We implement adversaries spanning from simplistic spoofers to advanced ones synchronized with the GNSS constellation. We demonstrate attack detection is possible in all tested cases (sharp discontinuity, smooth take-over, and coordinated network manipulation) without changes to the structure of the GNSS receiver. Leveraging the diversity of the reference time sources, detection of take-over time push as low as 150us is possible. Smooth take-overs forcing variations as low as 30ns are also detected based on on-board precision oscillators. The method (and thus the evaluation) is largely agnostic to the satellite constellation and the attacker type, making time-based data validation of GNSS information compatible with existing receivers and readily deployable.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems (Early Access)</p></details> |

FGO exhibits superior estimation accuracy compared with traditional state estimation methods that rely on least-squares or Kalman filters. However, only a few FGO libraries are specialized for GNSS observations. This paper introduces an open-source GNSS FGO package named gtsam\_gnss, which has a simple structure and can be easily applied to GNSS research and development. This package separates the preprocessing of GNSS observations from factor optimization. Moreover, it describes the error function of the GNSS factor in a straightforward manner, allowing for general-purpose inputs. This design facilitates the transition from ordinary least-squares-based positioning to FGO and supports user-specific GNSS research. In addition, gtsam\_gnss includes analytical examples involving various factors using GNSS data in real urban environments. This paper presents three application examples: the use of a robust error model, estimation of integer ambiguity in the carrier phase, and combination of GNSS and inertial measurements from smartphones. The proposed framework demonstrates excellent state estimation performance across all use cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 2025 IEEE/ION Position, Location and Navigation Symposium (PLANS)</p></details> |
| **[Consumer INS Coupled with Carrier Phase Measurements for GNSS Spoofing Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03870v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Global Navigation Satellite Systems enable precise localization and timing even for highly mobile devices, but legacy implementations provide only limited support for the new generation of security-enhanced signals. Inertial Measurement Units have proved successful in augmenting the accuracy and robustness of the GNSS-provided navigation solution, but effective navigation based on inertial techniques in denied contexts requires high-end sensors. However, commercially available mobile devices usually embed a much lower-grade inertial system. To counteract an attacker transmitting all the adversarial signals from a single antenna, we exploit carrier phase-based observations coupled with a low-end inertial sensor to identify spoofing and meaconing. By short-time integration with an inertial platform, which tracks the displacement of the GNSS antenna, the high-frequency movement at the receiver is correlated with the variation in the carrier phase. In this way, we identify legitimate transmitters, based on their geometrical diversity with respect to the antenna system movement. We introduce a platform designed to effectively compare different tiers of commercial INS platforms with a GNSS receiver. By characterizing different inertial sensors, we show that simple MEMS INS perform as well as high-end industrial-grade sensors. Sensors traditionally considered unsuited for navigation purposes offer great performance at the short integration times used to evaluate the carrier phase information consistency against the high-frequency movement. Results from laboratory evaluation and through field tests at Jammertest 2024 show that the detector is up to 90% accurate in correctly identifying spoofing (or the lack of it), without any modification to the receiver structure, and with mass-production grade INS typical for mobile phones.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at ION ITM/PTTI 2025</p></details> |

This system works with a heterogeneous system consisting of multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) to perform inspection and intervention tasks in GNSS-denied or interrupted environments. The carrier, an electric catamaran measuring 4m by 7m, features a 4m by 6m deck supporting automated takeoff and landing for four DJI M300 drones, along with a 10kg-payload manipulator operable in up to level 3 sea conditions. Utilizing an offshore gimbal camera for navigation, the carrier can autonomously navigate, approach and dock with non-cooperative vessels, guided by an onboard camera, LiDAR, and Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) over a 3 km$^2$ area. UAVs equipped with onboard Ultra-Wideband (UWB) technology execute mapping, detection, and manipulation tasks using a versatile gripper designed for wet, saline conditions. Additionally, two UAVs can coordinate to transport large objects to the manipulator or interact directly with them. These procedures are fully automated and were successfully demonstrated at the Mohammed Bin Zayed International Robotic Competition (MBZIRC2024), where the drone carrier equipped with four UAVS and one manipulator, automatically accomplished the intervention tasks in sea-level-3 (wave height 1.25m) based on the rough target information.</p></details> | 15 pages, 12pages |
| **[PO-GVINS: Tightly Coupled GNSS-Visual-Inertial Integration with Pose-Only Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07259v2)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and reliable positioning is crucial for perception, decision-making, and other high-level applications in autonomous driving, unmanned aerial vehicles, and intelligent robots. Given the inherent limitations of standalone sensors, integrating heterogeneous sensors with complementary capabilities is one of the most effective approaches to achieving this goal. In this paper, we propose a filtering-based, tightly coupled global navigation satellite system (GNSS)-visual-inertial positioning framework with a pose-only formulation applied to the visual-inertial system (VINS), termed PO-GVINS. Specifically, multiple-view imaging used in current VINS requires a priori of 3D feature, then jointly estimate camera poses and 3D feature position, which inevitably introduces linearization error of the feature as well as facing dimensional explosion. However, the pose-only (PO) formulation, which is demonstrated to be equivalent to the multiple-view imaging and has been applied in visual reconstruction, represent feature depth using two camera poses and thus 3D feature position is removed from state vector avoiding aforementioned difficulties. Inspired by this, we first apply PO formulation in our VINS, i.e., PO-VINS. GNSS raw measurements are then incorporated with integer ambiguity resolved to achieve accurate and drift-free estimation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed PO-VINS significantly outperforms the multi-state constrained Kalman filter (MSCKF). By incorporating GNSS measurements, PO-GVINS achieves accurate, drift-free state estimation, making it a robust solution for positioning in challenging environments.</p></details> |  |

Despite their adaptability and efficiency, LLMs have not been extensively explored for signal processing tasks, particularly in the domain of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) interference monitoring. GNSS interference monitoring is essential to ensure the reliability of vehicle localization on roads, a critical requirement for numerous applications. However, GNSS-based positioning is vulnerable to interference from jamming devices, which can compromise its accuracy. The primary objective is to identify, classify, and mitigate these interferences. Interpreting GNSS snapshots and the associated interferences presents significant challenges due to the inherent complexity, including multipath effects, diverse interference types, varying sensor characteristics, and satellite constellations. In this paper, we extract features from a large GNSS dataset and employ LLaVA to retrieve relevant information from an extensive knowledge base. We employ prompt engineering to interpret the interferences and environmental factors, and utilize t-SNE to analyze the feature embeddings. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed method is capable of visual and logical reasoning within the GNSS context. Furthermore, our pipeline outperforms state-of-the-art machine learning models in interference classification tasks.</p></details> |  |

Recent studies have shown the significant advantages of the wheel-mounted inertial measurement unit (Wheel-IMU)-based dead reckoning system. However, it still drifts over extended periods because of the absence of external correction signals. To achieve the goal of long-term accurate localization, we propose Wheel-GINS, a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)/inertial navigation system (INS) integrated navigation system using a Wheel-IMU. Wheel-GINS fuses the GNSS position measurement with the Wheel-IMU via an extended Kalman filter to limit the long-term error drift and provide continuous state estimation when the GNSS signal is blocked. Considering the specificities of the GNSS/Wheel-IMU integration, we conduct detailed modeling and online estimation of the Wheel-IMU installation parameters, including the Wheel-IMU leverarm and mounting angle and the wheel radius error. Experimental results have shown that Wheel-GINS outperforms the traditional GNSS/Odometer/INS integrated navigation system during GNSS outages. At the same time, Wheel-GINS can effectively estimate the Wheel-IMU installation parameters online and, consequently, improve the localization accuracy and practicality of the system.

As the backbone for positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) across various applications including transportation, telecommunications, and emergency services GNSS is vulnerable to deliberate interference that poses significant risks. Spoofing attacks, which involve transmitting counterfeit GNSS signals to mislead receivers into calculating incorrect positions, can result in serious consequences, from navigational errors in civilian aviation to security breaches in military operations. Furthermore, the lack of inherent security measures within GNSS systems makes them attractive targets for adversaries. While GNSS/GPS jamming and spoofing systems consist of numerous components, the ability to distinguish authentic signals from malicious ones is essential for maintaining system integrity. Recent advancements in machine learning and deep learning provide promising avenues for enhancing detection and mitigation strategies against these threats. This paper addresses both spoofing and jamming by tackling real-world challenges through machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision techniques. Through extensive experiments on two real-world datasets related to spoofing and jamming detection using advanced algorithms, we achieved state of the art results. In the GNSS/GPS jamming detection task, we attained approximately 99% accuracy, improving performance by around 5% compared to previous studies. Additionally, we addressed a challenging tasks related to spoofing detection, yielding results that underscore the potential of machine learning and deep learning in this domain.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose an FL approach using few-shot learning and aggregation of the model weights on a global server. We introduce a dynamic early stopping method to balance out-of-distribution classes based on representation learning, specifically utilizing the maximum mean discrepancy of feature embeddings between local and global models. An exemplary application of FL is to orchestrate machine learning models along highways for interference classification based on snapshots from global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receivers.

While global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) provide low-cost and reliable positioning services, they are often hindered in complex urban canyon environments. Thus, exploring opportunistic signals for positioning in urban areas has become a key solution. Augmented reality (AR) allows pedestrians to acquire real-time visual information. Accordingly, we propose a low-cost visual-inertial positioning solution. This method comprises a lightweight multi-scale group convolution (MSGC)-based visual place recognition (VPR) neural network, a pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) algorithm, and a visual/inertial fusion approach based on a Kalman filter with gross error suppression. The VPR serves as a conditional observation to the Kalman filter, effectively correcting the errors accumulated through the PDR method. This enables the entire algorithm to ensure the reliability of long-term positioning in GNSS-denied areas. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method maintains stable positioning during large-scale movements. Compared to the lightweight MobileNetV3-based VPR method, our proposed VPR solution improves Recall@1 by at least 3\% on two public datasets while reducing the number of parameters by 63.37\%. It also achieves performance that is comparable to the VGG16-based method. The VPR-PDR algorithm improves localization accuracy by more than 40\% compared to the original PDR.</p></details> |  |

This work provides the necessary checks and synchronization protocols needed in the broadcast-only GNSS context. We provide proof of security for each of our algorithms under a delay-capable adversary. The algorithms included herein enable a GNSS receiver to use its onboard, GNSS-independent clock to determine whether a message arrived at the correct time, to determine whether its onboard, GNSS-independent clock is safe to use and when the clock will no longer be safe in the future due to predicted clock drift, and to resynchronize its onboard, GNSS-independent clock. Each algorithm is safe to use even when an adversary induces delays within the protocol. Moreover, we discuss the implications of GNSS authentication schemes that use two simultaneous TESLA instances of different authentication cadences. To a receiver implementer or standards author, this work provides the necessary implementation algorithms to assert security and provides a comprehensive guide on why these methods are required.</p></details> | 16 pages, 15 figures |

Traditional approaches often rely on intrusive and/or expensive external hardware sensors. These systems typically have limited spatial coverage. In response to these limitations, this work aims to investigate an unintrusive and cost-effective alternative for road user classification by using high-frequency (1-2 Hz) positional sequences. A cutting-edge solution could involve leveraging positioning data from 5G networks. However, this feature is currently only proposed in the 3GPP standard and has not yet been implemented for outdoor applications by 5G equipment vendors. Therefore, our approach relies on positional data, that is recorded under real-world conditions using Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and processed on distributed edge devices. As a start-ing point, four types of road users are distinguished: pedestri-ans, cyclists, motorcycles, and passenger cars. While earlier approaches used classical statistical methods, we propose Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks (RNNs) as the preferred classification method, as they repre-sent state-of-the-art in processing sequential data. An RNN architecture for road user classification, based on selected motion characteristics derived from raw positional sequences is presented and the influence of sequence length on classifica-tion quality is examined. The results of the work show that RNNs are capable of efficiently classifying road users on dis-tributed devices, and can particularly differentiate between types of motorized vehicles, based on two- to four-minute se-quences.</p></details> |  |

In these environments, characterized by weakly textured sea surfaces with few feature points, chaotic deck oscillations due to waves, and significant wind gusts, conventional navigation methods often prove inadequate. Leveraging the DJI M300 platform, our system is designed to autonomously navigate and transport cargo while overcoming these environmental challenges. In particular, this paper proposes an anchor-based localization method using ultrawideband (UWB) and QR codes facilities, which decouples the UAV's attitude from that of the moving landing platform, thus reducing control oscillations caused by platform movement. Additionally, a motor-driven attachment mechanism for cargo is designed, which enhances the UAV's field of view during descent and ensures a reliable attachment to the cargo upon landing. The system's reliability and effectiveness were progressively enhanced through multiple outdoor experimental iterations and were validated by the successful cargo transport during the 2024 Mohamed BinZayed International Robotics Challenge (MBZIRC2024) competition. Crucially, the system addresses uncertainties and interferences inherent in maritime transportation missions without prior knowledge of cargo locations on the deck and with strict limitations on intervention throughout the transportation.</p></details> |  |
| **[IM-GIV: an effective integrity monitoring scheme for tightly-coupled GNSS/INS/Vision integration based on factor graph optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22672v1)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Global Navigation Satellite System/Inertial Navigation System (GNSS/INS)/Vision integration based on factor graph optimization (FGO) has recently attracted extensive attention in navigation and robotics community. Integrity monitoring (IM) capability is required when FGO-based integrated navigation system is used for safety-critical applications. However, traditional researches on IM of integrated navigation system are mostly based on Kalman filter. It is urgent to develop effective IM scheme for FGO-based GNSS/INS/Vision integration. In this contribution, the position error bounding formula to ensure the integrity of the GNSS/INS/Vision integration based on FGO is designed and validated for the first time. It can be calculated by the linearized equations from the residuals of GNSS pseudo-range, IMU pre-integration and visual measurements. The specific position error bounding is given in the case of GNSS, INS and visual measurement faults. Field experiments were conducted to evaluate and validate the performance of the proposed position error bounding. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed position error bounding for the GNSS/INS/Vision integration based on FGO can correctly fit the position error against different fault modes, and the availability of integrity in six fault modes is 100% after correct and timely fault exclusion.</p></details> |  |
| **[A framework for GNSS-based solutions performance analysis in an ERTMS context](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18510v1)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Context Progresses in GNSS-based solution introduction in rail applications GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) is now used in most of our travels and each of our smartphone apps. Most of the usages are not safety-critical. But Europe identified GNSS for more applications and to be integrated in rail in general as part of the toolset to help railway to contribute to reduce transport carbon footprint. To increase the use of trains in European transports, railways must improve their attractiveness for passengers and freight, but also increase reliability, availability and efficiency by reducing capital expenditure and operational costs. GNSS is part of the global digitalization scheme of freight that aims to offer added value to the clients knowledge of accurate time of arrival, continuous monitoring of transport conditions (temperature, humidity...). But a major challenge will be to reach stringent applications and in particular, GNSS is today seen as a realistic and serious game changer for the future of the ERTMS (European Rail Traffic Management System). The localisation function is today performed with both odometry and balises. Odometer provides a continuous train position in time from a reference point. But as the distance delivered by the odometer shows a growing bias with distance, due to wear and wheel sliding, the use of on-track balises allows to reduce this error. Future systems will be based on on-board localisation solutions with GNSS receivers. It will allow the development of new concepts for moving blocks, virtual coupling and automation. Its use for train integrity is also investigated. But the environmental conditions of track and surroundings configuration, i.e, tunnels, dense urban areas or vegetation often degrade positioning performance and thus its efficiency and safety. Indeed, GNSS satellites are moving and their visibility (availability and relative position from the receiver) vary with time. Moreover, for optimal performance, the system requires open sky environments, which are the cases of most of the aeronautical uses but not of train uses. Trains often circulate in areas where signal reception can be disturbed (multipath, intentional or unintentional interferences) and thus, performances degraded. If many progresses have been made in the past years to develop more robust receivers [Puccitelli, 2022], multi-sensor solutions [CLUG website] or missing tools such as Digital Maps [Crespillo, 2023], in projects such as the Shift2Rail Project X2Rail-5 or CLUG, some questions remain and in particular related to performance evaluation. How can we evaluate performances in a dynamic environment (train, satellite, obstacles)? How can we be sure that every configuration has been tested? What is the impact of a failure (inaccuracy, missed detection) on operation? Some of these issues are addressed in the on-going R2DATO project funded by Europe's rail.</p></details> |  |
| **[Long-distance Geomagnetic Navigation in GNSS-denied Environments with Deep Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15837v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Geomagnetic navigation has drawn increasing attention with its capacity in navigating through complex environments and its independence from external navigation services like global navigation satellite systems (GNSS). Existing studies on geomagnetic navigation, i.e., matching navigation and bionic navigation, rely on pre-stored map or extensive searches, leading to limited applicability or reduced navigation efficiency in unexplored areas. To address the issues with geomagnetic navigation in areas where GNSS is unavailable, this paper develops a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based mechanism, especially for long-distance geomagnetic navigation. The designed mechanism trains an agent to learn and gain the magnetoreception capacity for geomagnetic navigation, rather than using any pre-stored map or extensive and expensive searching approaches. Particularly, we integrate the geomagnetic gradient-based parallel approach into geomagnetic navigation. This integration mitigates the over-exploration of the learning agent by adjusting the geomagnetic gradient, such that the obtained gradient is aligned towards the destination. We explore the effectiveness of the proposed approach via detailed numerical simulations, where we implement twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) in realizing the proposed approach. The results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing metaheuristic and bionic navigation methods in long-distance missions under diverse navigation conditions.</p></details> |  |

| **[Towards a Self-rescuing System for UAVs Under GNSS Attack](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02442v1)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There has been substantial growth in the UAV market along with an expansion in their applications. However, the successful execution of a UAV mission is very often dependent on the use of a GNSS. Unfortunately, the vulnerability of GNSS signals, due to their lack of encryption and authentication, poses a significant cybersecurity issue. This vulnerability makes various attacks, particularly the "GNSS spoofing attack," and "GNSS jamming attack" easily executable. Generally speaking, during this attack, the drone is manipulated into altering its path, usually resulting in an immediate forced landing or crash. As far as we know, we are the first to propose a lightweight-solution that enable a drone to autonomously rescue itself, assuming it is under GNSS attack and the GNSS is no longer available, and return safely to its initial takeoff position, thereby preventing any potential crashes. During the flight, wind plays a critical role as it can instantaneously alter the drone's position. To solve this problem, we have devised a highly effective 2-phases solution: (i) Forward Phase, for monitoring and recording the forward journey, and (ii) Backward Phase, that generates a backward route, based on the Forward Phase and wind presence. The final solution ensures strong performance in consistently returning the drone to the original position, even in wind situations, while maintaining a very fast computation time.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This article has been accepted for publication in the proceedings of the 2024 IEEE International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking And Communications (WiMob)</p></details> |
| **[Achieving Generalization in Orchestrating GNSS Interference Monitoring Stations Through Pseudo-Labeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14686v1)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The accuracy of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receivers is significantly compromised by interference from jamming devices. Consequently, the detection of these jammers are crucial to mitigating such interference signals. However, robust classification of interference using machine learning (ML) models is challenging due to the lack of labeled data in real-world environments. In this paper, we propose an ML approach that achieves high generalization in classifying interference through orchestrated monitoring stations deployed along highways. We present a semi-supervised approach coupled with an uncertainty-based voting mechanism by combining Monte Carlo and Deep Ensembles that effectively minimizes the requirement for labeled training samples to less than 5% of the dataset while improving adaptability across varying environments. Our method demonstrates strong performance when adapted from indoor environments to real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>DGON ...</summary><p>DGON Positioning and Navigation for Intelligent Transport Systems (POSNAV)</p></details> |

Enabling the use of high-accuracy GNSS sensors, this work focuses on the antenna lever arm calibration. We propose a globally optimal multi-antenna lever arm calibration approach based on motion measurements. For this, we derive an optimization method that further allows the integration of a-priori knowledge. Globally optimal solutions are obtained by leveraging the Lagrangian dual problem and a primal recovery strategy. Generally, motion-based calibration for autonomous vehicles is known to be difficult due to cars' predominantly planar motion. Therefore, we first describe the motion requirements for a unique solution and then propose a planar motion extension to overcome this issue and enable a calibration based on the restricted motion of autonomous vehicles. Last we present and discuss the results of our thorough evaluation. Using simulated and augmented real-world data, we achieve accurate calibration results and fast run times that allow online deployment.</p></details> |  |

However, a significant technological disparity exists as traditional GNSS algorithms are often developed in Fortran or C, contrasting with the Python-based implementation prevalent in deep learning tools. To address this discrepancy, this paper introduces pyrtklib, a Python binding for the widely utilized open-source GNSS tool, RTKLIB. This binding makes all RTKLIB functionalities accessible in Python, facilitating seamless integration. Moreover, we present a deep learning subsystem under pyrtklib, which is a novel deep learning framework that leverages pyrtklib to accurately predict weights and biases within the GNSS positioning process. The use of pyrtklib enables developers to easily and quickly prototype and implement deep learning-aided GNSS algorithms, showcasing its potential to enhance positioning accuracy significantly.</p></details> |  |

In a tutorial and unified exposition, we recall the recent theory of two-frame systems within the field of invariant Kalman filtering. We then show how to adapt it geometrically to address the considered problem, although it seems at first sight out of its scope. This yields an invariant extended Kalman filter having autonomous error equations, and state-independent Jacobians, which is shown to work remarkably well in simulations. The proposed novel construction thus extends the application scope of invariant filtering.</p></details> |  |
| **[An innovation-based cycle-slip, multipath estimation, detection and mitigation method for tightly coupled GNSS/INS/Vision navigation in urban areas](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03433v1)** | 2024-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Precise, consistent, and reliable positioning is crucial for a multitude of uses. In order to achieve high precision global positioning services, multi-sensor fusion techniques, such as the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)/Inertial Navigation System (INS)/Vision integration system, combine the strengths of various sensors. This technique is essential for localization in complex environments and has been widely used in the mass market. However, frequent signal deterioration and blocking in urban environments exacerbates the degradation of GNSS positioning and negatively impacts the performance of the multi-sensor integration system. For GNSS pseudorange and carrier phase observation data in the urban environment, we offer an innovation-based cycle slip/multipath estimation, detection, and mitigation (I-EDM) method to reduce the influence of multipath effects and cycle slips on location induced by obstruction in urban settings. The method obtains the innovations of GNSS observations with the cluster analysis method. Then the innovations are used to detect the cycle slips and multipath. Compared with the residual-based method, the innovation-based method avoids the residual overfitting caused by the least square method, resulting in better detection of outliers within the GNSS observations. The vehicle tests carried out in urban settings verify the proposed approach. Experimental results indicate that the accuracy of 0.23m, 0.11m, and 0.31m in the east, north and up components can be achieved by the GNSS/INS/Vision tightly coupled system with the I-EDM method, which has a maximum of 21.6% improvement when compared with the residual-based EDM (R-EDM) method.</p></details> |  |

However, in complex urban canyon environments, the vulnerability of a stand-alone sensor and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) caused by high buildings, trees, and elevated structures seriously affect positioning results. To address these challenges, a sky-view images segmentation algorithm based on Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) is proposed for GNSS NLOS detection. Building upon this, a novel NLOS detection and mitigation algorithm (named S-NDM) is extended to the tightly coupled Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), Inertial Measurement Units (IMU), and visual feature system which is called Sky-GVIO, with the aim of achieving continuous and accurate positioning in urban canyon environments. Furthermore, the system harmonizes Single Point Positioning (SPP) with Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) methodologies to bolster its operational versatility and resilience. In urban canyon environments, the positioning performance of S-NDM algorithm proposed in this paper is evaluated under different tightly coupled SPP-related and RTK-related models. The results exhibit that Sky-GVIO system achieves meter-level accuracy under SPP mode and sub-decimeter precision with RTK, surpassing the performance of GNSS/INS/Vision frameworks devoid of S-NDM. Additionally, the sky-view image dataset, inclusive of training and evaluation subsets, has been made publicly accessible for scholarly exploration at https://github.com/whuwangjr/sky-view-images .</p></details> |  |

Both require spatial models for effective route planning and localization. This paper addresses the challenge of road graph construction for autonomous vehicles. Despite recent advances, creating a road graph remains labor-intensive and has yet to achieve full automation. The goal of this paper is to generate such graphs automatically and accurately. Modern cars are equipped with onboard sensors used for today's advanced driver assistance systems like lane keeping. We propose using global navigation satellite system (GNSS) traces and basic image data acquired from these standard sensors in consumer vehicles to estimate road-level maps with minimal effort. We exploit the spatial information in the data by framing the problem as a road centerline semantic segmentation task using a convolutional neural network. We also utilize the data's time series nature to refine the neural network's output by using map matching. We implemented and evaluated our method using a fleet of real consumer vehicles, only using the deployed onboard sensors. Our evaluation demonstrates that our approach not only matches existing methods on simpler road configurations but also significantly outperforms them on more complex road geometries and topologies.

Sensors are often corrupted in those complicated and large-scale environments. This paper introduces GNSS-FGO, an online and global trajectory estimator that fuses GNSS observations alongside multiple sensor measurements for robust vehicle localization. In GNSS-FGO, we fuse asynchronous sensor measurements into the graph with a continuous-time trajectory representation using Gaussian process regression. This enables querying states at arbitrary timestamps so that sensor observations are fused without requiring strict state and measurement synchronization. Thus, the proposed method presents a generalized factor graph for multi-sensor fusion. To evaluate and study different GNSS fusion strategies, we fuse GNSS measurements in loose and tight coupling with a speed sensor, IMU, and lidar-odometry. We employed datasets from measurement campaigns in Aachen, Duesseldorf, and Cologne in experimental studies and presented comprehensive discussions on sensor observations, smoother types, and hyperparameter tuning. Our results show that the proposed approach enables robust trajectory estimation in dense urban areas, where the classic multi-sensor fusion method fails due to sensor degradation. In a test sequence containing a 17km route through Aachen, the proposed method results in a mean 2D positioning error of 0.48m while fusing raw GNSS observations with lidar odometry in a tight coupling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the IEEE Transactions on Robotics</p></details> |
| **[FE-GUT: Factor Graph Optimization hybrid with Extended Kalman Filter for tightly coupled GNSS/UWB Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06915v1)** | 2024-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Precise positioning and navigation information has been increasingly important with the development of the consumer electronics market. Due to some deficits of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), such as susceptible to interferences, integrating of GNSS with additional alternative sensors is a promising approach to overcome the performance limitations of GNSS-based localization systems. Ultra-Wideband (UWB) can be used to enhance GNSS in constructing an integrated localization system. However, most low-cost UWB devices lack a hardware-level time synchronization feature, which necessitates the estimation and compensation of the time-offset in the tightly coupled GNSS/UWB integration. Given the flexibility of probabilistic graphical models, the time-offset can be modeled as an invariant constant in the discretization of the continuous model. This work proposes a novel architecture in which Factor Graph Optimization (FGO) is hybrid with Extend Kalman Filter (EKF) for tightly coupled GNSS/UWB integration with online Temporal calibration (FE-GUT). FGO is utilized to precisely estimate the time-offset, while EKF provides initailization for the new factors and performs time-offset compensation. Simulation-based experiments validate the integrated localization performance of FE-GUT. In a four-wheeled robot scenario, the results demonstrate that, compared to EKF, FE-GUT can improve horizontal and vertical localization accuracy by 58.59\% and 34.80\%, respectively, while the time-offset estimation accuracy is improved by 76.80\%.

This paper proposes a minimalist approach exploiting track geometry and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensor data. By integrating a discrete track map as a Look-Up Table (LUT) into a Particle Filter (PF) based solution, accurate train positioning is achieved with only an IMU sensor and track map data. The approach is tested on an open railway positioning data set, showing that accurate positioning (absolute errors below 10 m) can be maintained during GNSS outages up to 30 s in the given data. We simulate outages on different track segments and show that accurate positioning is reached during track curves and curvy railway lines. The approach can be used as a redundant complement to established positioning solutions to increase the position estimate's reliability and robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 10 figures, accepted to 27th International Conference on Information Fusion (FUSION 2024)</p></details> |

In this paper, we develop a novel GNSS-Visual-Inertial Navigation System (GVINS) that fuses visual, inertial, and raw GNSS measurements within the square-root inverse sliding window filtering (SRI-SWF) framework in a tightly coupled fashion, which thus is termed SRI-GVINS. In particular, for the first time, we deeply fuse the GNSS pseudorange, Doppler shift, single-differenced pseudorange, and double-differenced carrier phase measurements, along with the visual-inertial measurements. Inherited from the SRI-SWF, the proposed SRI-GVINS gains significant numerical stability and computational efficiency over the start-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we propose to use a filter to sequentially initialize the reference frame transformation till converges, rather than collecting measurements for batch optimization. We also perform online calibration of GNSS-IMU extrinsic parameters to mitigate the possible extrinsic parameter degradation. The proposed SRI-GVINS is extensively evaluated on our own collected UAV datasets and the results demonstrate that the proposed method is able to suppress VIO drift in real-time and also show the effectiveness of online GNSS-IMU extrinsic calibration. The experimental validation on the public datasets further reveals that the proposed SRI-GVINS outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.</p></details> |  |

Due to the low GNSS received signal power, even low-power radiofrequency interference (RFI) sources are a serious threat to the GNSS integrity and availability. Nonetheless, RFI source localization is paramount yet hard, especially over large areas. Methods based on multi-rotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) exist but are often limited by hovering time, and require specific antenna and detectors. In comparison, fixed-wing planes allow longer missions but are more complex to operate and deploy. A vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) UAV combines the positive aspects of both platforms: high maneuverability, and long mission time and, jointly with highly integrated control systems, simple operation and deployment. Building upon the flexibility allowed by such a platform, we propose a method that combines advanced flight dynamics with high-performance consumer receivers to detect interference over large areas, with minimal interaction with the operator. The proposed system can detect multiple interference sources and map their area of influence, gaining situational awareness of poor GNSS quality or denied environments. Furthermore, it can estimate the relative heading and position of the interference source within tens of meters. The proposed method is validated with real-life measurements, successfully mapping two interference-affected areas and exposing radio equipment causing involuntary in-band interference.</p></details> | <details><summary>In pr...</summary><p>In proceedings of the 2024 IEEE Aerospace Conference (AeroConf)</p></details> |

Detecting anomalies in frequency snapshots is crucial to counteract these interferences effectively. The ability to adapt to diverse, unseen interference characteristics is essential for ensuring the reliability of GNSS in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a few-shot learning (FSL) approach to adapt to new interference classes. Our method employs quadruplet selection for the model to learn representations using various positive and negative interference classes. Furthermore, our quadruplet variant selects pairs based on the aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty to differentiate between similar classes. We recorded a dataset at a motorway with eight interference classes on which our FSL method with quadruplet loss outperforms other FSL techniques in jammer classification accuracy with 97.66%.

Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) provides the foundation for absolute positioning. Recently enhanced Precise Point Positioning (PPP) technology now offers corrections for GNSS on a global scale, with the potential to achieve accuracy suitable for real-time CAV applications. However, in obstructed sky conditions, GNSS signals are often affected by outliers; therefore, addressing outliers is crucial. In GNSS applications, there are many more measurements available than are required to meet the specification. Therefore, selecting measurements to avoid outliers is of interest. The recently developed Risk-Averse Performance-Specified (RAPS) state estimation optimally selects measurements to minimize outlier risk while meeting a positive semi-definite constraint on performance; at present, the existing solution methods are not suitable for real-time computation and have not been demonstrated using challenging real-world data or in Real-time PPP (RT-PPP) applications. This article makes contributions in a few directions. First, it uses a diagonal performance specification, which reduces computational costs relative to the positive semi-definite constraint. Second, this article considers GNSS RT-PPP applications. Third, the experiments use real-world GNSS data collected in challenging environments. The RT-PPP experimental results show that among the compared methods: all achieve comparable performance in open-sky conditions, and all exceed the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) specification; however, in challenging environments, the diagonal RAPS approach shows improvement of 6-19% over traditional methods.

The accurate prediction of STEC is essential for mitigating the ionospheric impact particularly on Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). In this work, we propose a high-precision STEC prediction model named DeepONet-STEC, which learns nonlinear operators to predict the 4D temporal-spatial integrated parameter for specified ground station - satellite ray path globally. As a demonstration, we validate the performance of the model based on GNSS observation data for global and US-CORS regimes under ionospheric quiet and storm conditions. The DeepONet-STEC model results show that the three-day 72 hour prediction in quiet periods could achieve high accuracy using observation data by the Precise Point Positioning (PPP) with temporal resolution 30s. Under active solar magnetic storm periods, the DeepONet-STEC also demonstrated its robustness and superiority than traditional deep learning methods. This work presents a neural operator regression architecture for predicting the 4D temporal-spatial ionospheric parameter for satellite navigation system performance, which may be further extended for various space applications and beyond.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multiple Update Particle Filter: Position Estimation by Combining GNSS Pseudorange and Carrier Phase Observations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03394v1)** | 2024-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents an efficient method for updating particles in a particle filter (PF) to address the position estimation problem when dealing with sharp-peaked likelihood functions derived from multiple observations. Sharp-peaked likelihood functions commonly arise from millimeter-accurate distance observations of carrier phases in the global navigation satellite system (GNSS). However, when such likelihood functions are used for particle weight updates, the absence of particles within the peaks leads to all particle weights becoming zero. To overcome this problem, in this study, a straightforward and effective approach is introduced for updating particles when dealing with sharp-peaked likelihood functions obtained from multiple observations. The proposed method, termed as the multiple update PF, leverages prior knowledge regarding the spread of distribution for each likelihood function and conducts weight updates and resampling iteratively in the particle update process, prioritizing the likelihood function spreads. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method, particularly when applied to position estimation utilizing GNSS pseudorange and carrier phase observations. The multiple update PF exhibits faster convergence with fewer particles when compared to the conventional PF. Moreover, vehicle position estimation experiments conducted in urban environments reveal that the proposed method outperforms conventional GNSS positioning techniques, yielding more accurate position estimates.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 2024 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA 2024)</p></details> |
| **[GNSS Positioning using Cost Function Regulated Multilateration and Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18630v1)** | 2024-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In urban environments, where line-of-sight signals from GNSS satellites are frequently blocked by high-rise objects, GNSS receivers are subject to large errors in measuring satellite ranges. Heuristic methods are commonly used to estimate these errors and reduce the impact of noisy measurements on localization accuracy. In our work, we replace these error estimation heuristics with a deep learning model based on Graph Neural Networks. Additionally, by analyzing the cost function of the multilateration process, we derive an optimal method to utilize the estimated errors. Our approach guarantees that the multilateration converges to the receiver's location as the error estimation accuracy increases. We evaluate our solution on a real-world dataset containing more than 100k GNSS epochs, collected from multiple cities with diverse characteristics. The empirical results show improvements from 40% to 80% in the horizontal localization error against recent deep learning baselines as well as classical localization approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in The Proceedings of the Institute of Navigation GNSS+ 2023</p></details> |
| **[Angle Robustness Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Navigation in GNSS-Denied Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02405v1)** | 2024-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the inability to receive signals from the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) in extreme conditions, achieving accurate and robust navigation for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is a challenging task. Recently emerged, vision-based navigation has been a promising and feasible alternative to GNSS-based navigation. However, existing vision-based techniques are inadequate in addressing flight deviation caused by environmental disturbances and inaccurate position predictions in practical settings. In this paper, we present a novel angle robustness navigation paradigm to deal with flight deviation in point-to-point navigation tasks. Additionally, we propose a model that includes the Adaptive Feature Enhance Module, Cross-knowledge Attention-guided Module and Robust Task-oriented Head Module to accurately predict direction angles for high-precision navigation. To evaluate the vision-based navigation methods, we collect a new dataset termed as UAV_AR368. Furthermore, we design the Simulation Flight Testing Instrument (SFTI) using Google Earth to simulate different flight environments, thereby reducing the expenses associated with real flight testing. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art by achieving improvements of 26.0% and 45.6% in the success rate of arrival under ideal and disturbed circumstances, respectively.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Mobile robot localization with GNSS multipath detection using pseudorange residuals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08054v1)** | 2024-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a novel positioning technique suitable for use in mobile robots in urban environments in which large global navigation satellite system (GNSS) positioning errors occur because of multipath signals. During GNSS positioning, the GNSS satellites that are obstructed by buildings emit reflection and diffraction signals, which are called non-line-of-sight (NLOS) multipath signals. These multipath signals cause major positioning errors. The key concept considered in this paper is the estimation of a user's position using the likelihood of the position hypotheses computed from the GNSS pseudoranges, consisting only of LOS signals based on the analysis of the pseudorange residuals. To determine the NLOS GNSS signals from the pseudorange residuals at the user's position, it is necessary to accurately determine the position before the computation of the pseudorange residuals. This problem is solved using a particle filter. We propose a likelihood estimation method using the Mahalanobis distance between the hypotheses of the user's position computed from only the LOS pseudoranges and the particles. To confirm the effectiveness of the proposed technique, a positioning test was performed in a real-world urban environment. The results demonstrated that the proposed method is effective for accurately estimating the user's position in urban canyons.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an electronic version of an article published in ADVANCED ROBOTICS, 33(12):602-613, 2019.

| **[Experimental Validation of Sensor Fusion-based GNSS Spoofing Attack Detection Framework for Autonomous Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01304v1)** | 2024-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we validate the performance of the a sensor fusion-based Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) spoofing attack detection framework for Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). To collect data, a vehicle equipped with a GNSS receiver, along with Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) is used. The detection framework incorporates two strategies: The first strategy involves comparing the predicted location shift, which is the distance traveled between two consecutive timestamps, with the inertial sensor-based location shift. For this purpose, data from low-cost in-vehicle inertial sensors such as the accelerometer and gyroscope sensor are fused and fed into a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network. The second strategy employs a Random-Forest supervised machine learning model to detect and classify turns, distinguishing between left and right turns using the output from the steering angle sensor. In experiments, two types of spoofing attack models: turn-by-turn and wrong turn are simulated. These spoofing attacks are modeled as SQL injection attacks, where, upon successful implementation, the navigation system perceives injected spoofed location information as legitimate while being unable to detect legitimate GNSS signals. Importantly, the IMU data remains uncompromised throughout the spoofing attack. To test the effectiveness of the detection framework, experiments are conducted in Tuscaloosa, AL, mimicking urban road structures. The results demonstrate the framework's ability to detect various sophisticated GNSS spoofing attacks, even including slow position drifting attacks. Overall, the experimental results showcase the robustness and efficacy of the sensor fusion-based spoofing attack detection approach in safeguarding AVs against GNSS spoofing threats.</p></details> |  |

A satellite-wise Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) is designed to regress the pseudorange bias correction from six satellite, receiver, context-related features derived from Android raw Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) measurements. To train the MLP, we carefully calculate the target values of pseudorange bias using location ground truth and smoothing techniques and optimize a loss function involving the estimation residuals of smartphone clock bias. The corrected pseudoranges are then used by a model-based localization engine to compute locations. The Google Smartphone Decimeter Challenge (GSDC) dataset, which contains Android smartphone data collected from both rural and urban areas, is utilized for evaluation. Both fingerprinting and cross-trace localization results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms model-based and state-of-the-art data-driven approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attitude-Estimation-Free GNSS and IMU Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10142v2)** | 2023-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A global navigation satellite system (GNSS) is a sensor that can acquire 3D position and velocity in an earth-fixed coordinate system and is widely used for outdoor position estimation of robots and vehicles. Various GNSS/inertial measurement unit (IMU) integration methods have been proposed to improve the accuracy and availability of GNSS positioning. However, all these methods require the addition of a 3D attitude to the estimated state to fuse the IMU data. In this study, we propose a new optimization-based positioning method for combining GNSS and IMU that does not require attitude estimation. The proposed method uses two types of constraints: one is a constraint between states using only the magnitude of the 3D acceleration observed by an accelerometer, and the other is a constraint on the angle between the velocity vectors using the angular change measured by a gyroscope. The evaluation results with the simulation data show that the proposed method maintains the position estimation accuracy even when the IMU mounting position error increases and improves the accuracy when the GNSS observations contain multipath errors or missing data. The proposed method could improve positioning accuracy in experiments using IMUs acquired in real environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)</p></details> |

This method using differential equations is very accurate for very small distances on the surface of the earth in the 1500km range of the Indian subcontinent satellite coverage. When we talk of accuracy of the GPS system it should be very accurate on the surface of the earth when used to show changes in coordinate of the moving body with respect to the ground by the satellite which is situated on the earths orbit. Optical flow is a method which uses movements with respect to x and y axis for infinitesimal changes in its coordinates and then uses this algorithm to use it in global positioning system to find accurate position of the body with respect to the satellite coordinates with respect to ground positioning. The modern method of differential frames is also very accurate as it involves infinitesimal frames which are modelled together from the satellite to find changes in the coordinates on the earths surface, so we have designed a new algorithm in this paper on the Optical flow GNSS system which is an alternative and can improve the study done in the design of these algorithms in this field of applications.</p></details> |  |

We focus on the automatic operation of articulated six-wheel dump trucks at construction sites. For the automatic operation of the dump trucks, it is important to estimate the position and the articulated angle of the dump trucks with high accuracy. In this study, we propose a method for estimating the state of a dump truck by using four global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs) installed on an articulated dump truck and a graph optimization method that utilizes the redundancy of multiple GNSSs. By adding real-time kinematic (RTK)-GNSS constraints and geometric constraints between the four antennas, the proposed method can robustly estimate the position and articulation angle even in environments where GNSS satellites are partially blocked. As a result of evaluating the accuracy of the proposed method through field tests, it was confirmed that the articulated angle could be estimated with an accuracy of 0.1$^\circ$ in an open-sky environment and 0.7$^\circ$ in a mountainous area simulating an elevation angle of 45$^\circ$ where GNSS satellites are blocked.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an electronic version of an article published in ADVANCED ROBOTICS, 35:23, 1376-1387, 2021.

Direct three-dimensional (3D) mapping using a small-sized UAV equipped with a laser scanner is required for numerous remote sensing applications. In direct 3D mapping, the precise information about the position and attitude of the UAV is necessary for constructing 3D maps. In this study, we propose a novel and robust technique for estimating the position and attitude of small-sized UAVs by employing multiple low-cost and light-weight global navigation satellite system (GNSS) antennas/receivers. Using the "redundancy" of multiple GNSS receivers, we enhance the performance of real-time kinematic (RTK)-GNSS by employing single-frequency GNSS receivers. This method consists of two approaches: hybrid GNSS fix solutions and consistency examination of the GNSS signal strength. The fix rate of RTK-GNSS using single-frequency GNSS receivers can be highly enhanced to combine multiple RTK-GNSS to fix solutions in the multiple antennas. In addition, positioning accuracy and fix rate can be further enhanced to detect multipath signals by using multiple GNSS antennas. In this study, we developed a prototype UAV that is equipped with six GNSS antennas/receivers. From the static test results, we conclude that the proposed technique can enhance the accuracy of the position and attitude estimation in multipath environments. From the flight test, the proposed system could generate a 3D map with an accuracy of 5 cm.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) 2019</p></details> |
| **[Time-Relative RTK-GNSS: GNSS Loop Closure in Pose Graph Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02448v1)** | 2023-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A pose-graph-based optimization technique is widely used to estimate robot poses using various sensor measurements from devices such as laser scanners and cameras. The global navigation satellite system (GNSS) has recently been used to estimate the absolute 3D position of outdoor mobile robots. However, since the accuracy of GNSS single-point positioning is only a few meters, the GNSS is not used for the loop closure of a pose graph. The main purpose of this study is to generate a loop closure of a pose graph using a time-relative real-time kinematic GNSS (TR-RTK-GNSS) technique. The proposed TR-RTK-GNSS technique uses time-differential carrier phase positioning, which is based on carrier-phase-based differential GNSS with a single GNSS receiver. Unlike a conventional RTK-GNSS, we can directly compute the robot's relative position using only a stand-alone GNSS receiver. The initial pose graph is generated from the accumulated velocity computed from GNSS Doppler measurements. To reduce the accumulated error of velocity, we use the TR-RTK-GNSS technique for the loop closure in the graph-based optimization framework. The kinematic positioning tests were performed using an unmanned aerial vehicle to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed technique. From the tests, we can estimate the vehicle's trajectory with approximately 3 cm accuracy using only a stand-alone GNSS receiver.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L) and presented at the IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), 2020</p></details> |
| **[GNSS Odometry: Precise Trajectory Estimation Based on Carrier Phase Cycle Slip Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02424v1)** | 2023-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a highly accurate trajectory estimation method for outdoor mobile robots using global navigation satellite system (GNSS) time differences of carrier phase (TDCP) measurements. By using GNSS TDCP, the relative 3D position can be estimated with millimeter precision. However, when a phenomenon called cycle slip occurs, wherein the carrier phase measurement jumps and becomes discontinuous, it is impossible to accurately estimate the relative position using TDCP. Although previous studies have eliminated the effect of cycle slip using a robust optimization technique, it was difficult to completely eliminate the effect of outliers. In this paper, we propose a method to detect GNSS carrier phase cycle slip, estimate the amount of cycle slip, and modify the observed TDCP to calculate the relative position using the factor graph optimization framework. The estimated relative position acts as a loop closure in graph optimization and contributes to the reduction in the integration error of the relative position. Experiments with an unmanned aerial vehicle showed that by modifying the cycle slip using the proposed method, the vehicle trajectory could be estimated with an accuracy of 5 to 30 cm using only a single GNSS receiver, without using any other external data or sensors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L) and presented at the IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), 2022</p></details> |
| **[Clifford Algebra-Based Iterated Extended Kalman Filter with Application to Low-Cost INS/GNSS Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07049v2)** | 2023-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The traditional GNSS-aided inertial navigation system (INS) usually exploits the extended Kalman filter (EKF) for state estimation, and the initial attitude accuracy is key to the filtering performance. To spare the reliance on the initial attitude, this work generalizes the previously proposed trident quaternion within the framework of Clifford algebra to represent the extended pose, IMU biases and lever arms on the Lie group. Consequently, a quasi-group-affine system is established for the low-cost INS/GNSS integrated navigation system, and the right-error Clifford algebra-based EKF (Clifford-RQEKF) is accordingly developed. The iterated filtering approach is further applied to significantly improve the performances of the Clifford-RQEKF and the previously proposed trident quaternion-based EKFs. Numerical simulations and experiments show that all iterated filtering approaches fulfill the fast and global convergence without the prior attitude information, whereas the iterated Clifford-RQEKF performs much better than the others under especially large IMU biases.</p></details> |  |

In recent years, the integration of the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), Inertial Navigation System (INS), and camera has garnered considerable attention due to its robustness and high accuracy in diverse environments. However, leveraging the full capacity of GNSS is cumbersome because of the diverse choices of formulations, error models, satellite constellations, signal frequencies, and service types, which lead to different precision, robustness, and usage dependencies. To clarify the capacity of GNSS algorithms and accelerate the development efficiency of employing GNSS in multi-sensor fusion algorithms, we open source the GNSS/INS/Camera Integration Library (GICI-LIB), together with detailed documentation and a comprehensive land vehicle dataset. A factor graph optimization-based multi-sensor fusion framework is established, which combines almost all GNSS measurement error sources by fully considering temporal and spatial correlations between measurements. The graph structure is designed for flexibility, making it easy to form any kind of integration algorithm. For illustration, Real-Time Kinematic (RTK), Precise Point Positioning (PPP), and four RTK-based algorithms from GICI-LIB are evaluated using our dataset and public datasets.

It can lead to loss of assets, inaccurate fare estimation, enforcing the wrong speed limit, miscalculated toll tax, passengers reaching an incorrect location, etc. The techniques designed to prevent and detect spoofing by using cryptographic solutions or receivers capable of differentiating legitimate and attack signals are insufficient in detecting GNSS spoofing of road users. Recent studies, testbeds, and 3GPP standards are exploring the possibility of hybrid positioning, where GNSS data will be combined with the 5G-NR positioning to increase the security and accuracy of positioning. We design the Location Estimation and Recovery(LER) systems to estimate the correct absolute position using the combination of GNSS and 5G positioning with other road users, where a subset of road users can be malicious and collude to prevent spoofing detection. Our Location Verification Protocol extends the understanding of Message Time of Arrival Codes (MTAC) to prevent attacks against malicious provers. The novel Recovery and Meta Protocol uses road users' dynamic and unpredictable nature to detect GNSS spoofing. This protocol provides fast detection of GNSS spoofing with a very low rate of false positives and can be customized to a large family of settings. Even in a (highly unrealistic) worst-case scenario where each user is malicious with a probability of as large as 0.3, our protocol detects GNSS spoofing with high probability after communication and ranging with at most 20 road users, with a false positive rate close to 0. SUMO simulations for road traffic show that we can detect GNSS spoofing in 2.6 minutes since its start under moderate traffic conditions.</p></details> |  |

Traditional state-of-the-art estimation methods, e.g., the multiplicative Kalman filter (MEKF), have some limitations concerning their consistency, errors in the initial state estimate, and convergence performance. Symmetry-based methods, such as the equivariant filter (EqF), offer significant advantages for these points by exploiting the mathematical properties of the system - its symmetry. These filters yield faster convergence rates and robustness to wrong initial state estimates through their error definition. To demonstrate the usability of EqFs, we focus on the sensor-fusion problem with the most common sensors in outdoor robotics: global navigation satellite system (GNSS) sensors and an inertial measurement unit (IMU). We provide an implementation of such an EqF leveraging the semi-direct product of the symmetry group to derive the filter equations. To validate the practical usability of EqFs in real-world scenarios, we evaluate our method using data from all outdoor runs of the INSANE Dataset. Our results demonstrate the performance improvements of the EqF in real-world environments, highlighting its potential for enhancing state estimation for UAVs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pre-p...</summary><p>Pre-print version, accepted to IEEE ICAR 2023</p></details> |

To address this need, we present a novel multi-LiDAR dataset specifically designed for UAV tracking. Our dataset includes data from a spinning LiDAR, two solid-state LiDARs with different Field of View (FoV) and scan patterns, and an RGB-D camera. This diverse sensor suite allows for research on new challenges in the field, including limited FoV adaptability and multi-modality data processing. The dataset facilitates the evaluation of existing algorithms and the development of new ones, paving the way for advances in UAV tracking techniques. Notably, we provide data in both indoor and outdoor environments. We also consider variable UAV sizes, from micro-aerial vehicles to more standard commercial UAV platforms. The outdoor trajectories are selected with close proximity to buildings, targeting research in UAV detection in urban areas, e.g., within counter-UAV systems or docking for UAV logistics. In addition to the dataset, we provide a baseline comparison with recent LiDAR-based UAV tracking algorithms, benchmarking the performance with different sensors, UAVs, and algorithms. Importantly, our dataset shows that current methods have shortcomings and are unable to track UAVs consistently across different scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, GNSS observations can be distorted due to multipath effects and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) receptions in challenging environments such as urban canyons. In such cases, traditional methods to classify and exclude faulty GNSS observations may fail, leading to unreliable state estimation and unsafe system operations. This work proposes a deep-learning-based method to detect NLOS receptions and predict GNSS pseudorange errors by analyzing GNSS observations as a spatio-temporal modeling problem. Compared to previous works, we construct a transformer-like attention mechanism to enhance the long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, improving model performance and generalization. For the training and evaluation of the proposed network, we used labeled datasets from the cities of Hong Kong and Aachen. We also introduce a dataset generation process to label the GNSS observations using lidar maps. In experimental studies, we compare the proposed network with a deep-learning-based model and classical machine-learning models. Furthermore, we conduct ablation studies of our network components and integrate the NLOS detection with data out-of-distribution in a state estimator. As a result, our network presents improved precision and recall ratios compared to other models. Additionally, we show that the proposed method avoids trajectory divergence in real-world vehicle localization by classifying and excluding NLOS observations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for the IEEE ITSC2023</p></details> |

In parallel to boosting the transition to zero-carbon cars, there is an increasing interest in low-cost instruments for precise measurement of the environmental impact of the many internal combustion engine vehicles still in circulation. The main contribution of this work is the design and comparison of two innovative black-box algorithms, one based on a reduced complexity physics modeling while the other relying on a feedforward neural network for black-box fuel consumption estimation using only velocity and acceleration measurements. Based on suitable metrics, the developed algorithms outperform the state of the art best approach, both in the instantaneous and in the integral fuel consumption estimation, with errors smaller than 1\% with respect to the fuel flow ground truth. The data used for model identification, testing, and experimental validation is composed of GNSS velocity and IMU acceleration measurements collected during several trips using a diesel fuel vehicle on different roads, in different seasons, and with varying numbers of passengers. Compared to built-in vehicle monitoring systems, this methodology is not customized, uses off-the-shelf sensors, and is based on two simple algorithms that have been validated offline and could be easily implemented in a real-time environment.</p></details> |  |

However, conducting real-time forest inventory in large-scale and GNSS-interrupted forest environments has long been a formidable challenge. In this paper, we present a novel solution that leverages robotics and sensor-fusion technologies to overcome these challenges and enable real-time forest inventory with higher accuracy and efficiency. The proposed solution consists of a new SLAM algorithm to create an accurate 3D map of large-scale forest stands with detailed estimation about the number of trees and the corresponding DBH, solely with the consecutive scans of a 3D lidar and an imu. This method utilized a hierarchical unsupervised clustering algorithm to detect the trees and measure the DBH from the lidar point cloud. The algorithm can run simultaneously as the data is being recorded or afterwards on the recorded dataset. Furthermore, due to the proposed fast feature extraction and transform estimation modules, the recorded data can be fed to the SLAM with higher frequency than common SLAM algorithms. The performance of the proposed solution was tested through filed data collection with hand-held sensor platform as well as a mobile forestry robot. The accuracy of the results was also compared to the state-of-the-art SLAM solutions.</p></details> |  |

When considering land vehicles,like autonomous ground vehicles,off-road vehicles or mobile robots,a GNSS-based heading angle measurement can be obtained and used in parallel to the position measurement to bound the heading angle drift. Yet, at low vehicle speeds (less than 2m/s) such a model-based heading measurement fails to provide satisfactory performance. This paper proposes GHNet, a deep-learning framework capable of accurately regressing the heading angle for vehicles operating at low speeds. We demonstrate that GHNet outperforms the current model-based approach for simulation and experimental datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages with 12 figures</p></details> |

In contrast, our knowledge of the \emph{message complexity} of distributed computing problems and its relationship (if any) with round complexity is still quite limited. To illustrate, for many fundamental distributed graph optimization problems such as (exact) diameter computation, All-Pairs Shortest Paths (APSP), Maximum Matching etc., while (near) round-optimal algorithms are known, message-optimal algorithms are hitherto unknown. More importantly, the existing round-optimal algorithms are not message-optimal. This raises two important questions: (1) Can we design message-optimal algorithms for these problems? (2) Can we give message-time tradeoffs for these problems in case the message-optimal algorithms are not round-optimal? In this work, we focus on a fundamental graph optimization problem, \emph{All Pairs Shortest Path (APSP)}, whose message complexity is still unresolved. We present two main results in the CONGEST model: (1) We give a message-optimal (up to logarithmic factors) algorithm that solves weighted APSP, using $\tilde{O}(n^2)$ messages. This algorithm takes $\tilde{O}(n^2)$ rounds. (2) For any $0 \leq \varepsilon \le 1$, we show how to solve unweighted APSP in $\tilde{O}(n^{2-\varepsilon })$ rounds and $\tilde{O}(n^{2+\varepsilon })$ messages. At one end of this smooth trade-off, we obtain a (nearly) message-optimal algorithm using $\tilde{O}(n^2)$ messages (for $\varepsilon = 0$), whereas at the other end we get a (nearly) round-optimal algorithm using $\tilde{O}(n)$ rounds (for $\varepsilon = 1$). This is the first such message-time trade-off result known.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to PODC 2025, abstract shortened to fit arXiv constraints</p></details> |
| **[BRIGHT-VO: Brightness-Guided Hybrid Transformer for Visual Odometry with Multi-modality Refinement Module](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08659v4)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual odometry (VO) plays a crucial role in autonomous driving, robotic navigation, and other related tasks by estimating the position and orientation of a camera based on visual input. Significant progress has been made in data-driven VO methods, particularly those leveraging deep learning techniques to extract image features and estimate camera poses. However, these methods often struggle in low-light conditions because of the reduced visibility of features and the increased difficulty of matching keypoints. To address this limitation, we introduce BrightVO, a novel VO model based on Transformer architecture, which not only performs front-end visual feature extraction, but also incorporates a multi-modality refinement module in the back-end that integrates Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data. Using pose graph optimization, this module iteratively refines pose estimates to reduce errors and improve both accuracy and robustness. Furthermore, we create a synthetic low-light dataset, KiC4R, which includes a variety of lighting conditions to facilitate the training and evaluation of VO frameworks in challenging environments. Experimental results demonstrate that BrightVO achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the KiC4R dataset and the KITTI benchmarks. Specifically, it provides an average improvement of 20% in pose estimation accuracy in normal outdoor environments and 259% in low-light conditions, outperforming existing methods. For widespread use and further development, the research work is fully open-source at https://github.com/Anastasiawd/BrightVO.</p></details> |  |

This framework enables high-precision and highly robust real-time state estimation and map construction in challenging environments, such as LiDAR-degraded, low-texture regions, and feature-scarce areas. The LPVIMO-SAM comprises two subsystems: a Polarized Vision-Inertial System and a LiDAR/Inertial/Magnetometer/Optical Flow System. The polarized vision enhances the robustness of the Visual/Inertial odometry in low-feature and low-texture scenarios by extracting the polarization information of the scene. The magnetometer acquires the heading angle, and the optical flow obtains the speed and height to reduce the accumulated error. A magnetometer heading prior factor, an optical flow speed observation factor, and a height observation factor are designed to eliminate the cumulative errors of the LiDAR/Inertial odometry through factor graph optimization. Meanwhile, the LPVIMO-SAM can maintain stable positioning even when one of the two subsystems fails, further expanding its applicability in LiDAR-degraded, low-texture, and low-feature environments.

| **[Tightly-Coupled LiDAR-IMU-Wheel Odometry with an Online Neural Kinematic Model Learning via Factor Graph Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08907v5)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Environments lacking geometric features (e.g., tunnels and long straight corridors) are challenging for LiDAR-based odometry algorithms because LiDAR point clouds degenerate in such environments. For wheeled robots, a wheel kinematic model (i.e., wheel odometry) can improve the reliability of the odometry estimation. However, the kinematic model suffers from complex motions (e.g., wheel slippage, lateral movement) in the case of skid-steering robots particularly because this robot model rotates by skidding its wheels. Furthermore, these errors change nonlinearly when the wheel slippage is large (e.g., drifting) and are subject to terrain-dependent parameters. To simultaneously tackle point cloud degeneration and the kinematic model errors, we developed a LiDAR-IMU-wheel odometry algorithm incorporating online training of a neural network that learns the kinematic model of wheeled robots with nonlinearity. We propose to train the neural network online on a factor graph along with robot states, allowing the learning-based kinematic model to adapt to the current terrain condition. The proposed method jointly solves online training of the neural network and LiDAR-IMU-wheel odometry on a unified factor graph to retain the consistency of all those constraints. Through experiments, we first verified that the proposed network adapted to a changing environment, resulting in an accurate odometry estimation across different environments. We then confirmed that the proposed odometry estimation algorithm was robust against point cloud degeneration and nonlinearity (e.g., large wheel slippage by drifting) of the kinematic model.

| **[Disentangled Graph Representation Based on Substructure-Aware Graph Optimal Matching Kernel Convolutional Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16360v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphs effectively characterize relational data, driving graph representation learning methods that uncover underlying predictive information. As state-of-the-art approaches, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) enable end-to-end learning for diverse tasks. Recent disentangled graph representation learning enhances interpretability by decoupling independent factors in graph data. However, existing methods often implicitly and coarsely characterize graph structures, limiting structural pattern analysis within the graph. This paper proposes the Graph Optimal Matching Kernel Convolutional Network (GOMKCN) to address this limitation. We view graphs as node-centric subgraphs, where each subgraph acts as a structural factor encoding position-specific information. This transforms graph prediction into structural pattern recognition. Inspired by CNNs, GOMKCN introduces the Graph Optimal Matching Kernel (GOMK) as a convolutional operator, computing similarities between subgraphs and learnable graph filters. Mathematically, GOMK maps subgraphs and filters into a Hilbert space, representing graphs as point sets. Disentangled representations emerge from projecting subgraphs onto task-optimized filters, which adaptively capture relevant structural patterns via gradient descent. Crucially, GOMK incorporates local correspondences in similarity measurement, resolving the trade-off between differentiability and accuracy in graph kernels. Experiments validate that GOMKCN achieves superior accuracy and interpretability in graph pattern mining and prediction. The framework advances the theoretical foundation for disentangled graph representation learning.</p></details> |  |

Traditional SLAM approaches, which often rely on visual or LiDAR sensors, face significant challenges in adverse conditions such as low light or featureless environments. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel Doppler-aided radar-inertial and LiDAR-inertial SLAM framework that leverages the complementary strengths of 4D radar, FMCW LiDAR, and inertial measurement units. Our system integrates Doppler velocity measurements and spatial data into a tightly-coupled front-end and graph optimization back-end to provide enhanced ego velocity estimation, accurate odometry, and robust mapping. We also introduce a Doppler-based scan-matching technique to improve front-end odometry in dynamic environments. In addition, our framework incorporates an innovative online extrinsic calibration mechanism, utilizing Doppler velocity and loop closure to dynamically maintain sensor alignment. Extensive evaluations on both public and proprietary datasets show that our system significantly outperforms state-of-the-art radar-SLAM and LiDAR-SLAM frameworks in terms of accuracy and robustness. To encourage further research, the code of our Doppler-SLAM and our dataset are available at: https://github.com/Wayne-DWA/Doppler-SLAM.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Region Based SLAM-Aware Exploration: Efficient and Robust Autonomous Mapping Strategy That Can Scale](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10416v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous exploration for mapping unknown large scale environments is a fundamental challenge in robotics, with efficiency in time, stability against map corruption and computational resources being crucial. This paper presents a novel approach to indoor exploration that addresses these key issues in existing methods. We introduce a Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)-aware region-based exploration strategy that partitions the environment into discrete regions, allowing the robot to incrementally explore and stabilize each region before moving to the next one. This approach significantly reduces redundant exploration and improves overall efficiency. As the device finishes exploring a region and stabilizes it, we also perform SLAM keyframe marginalization, a technique which reduces problem complexity by eliminating variables, while preserving their essential information. To improves robustness and further enhance efficiency, we develop a check- point system that enables the robot to resume exploration from the last stable region in case of failures, eliminating the need for complete re-exploration. Our method, tested in real homes, office and simulations, outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. The improvements demonstrate substantial enhancements in various real world environments, with significant reductions in keyframe usage (85%), submap usage (50% office, 32% home), pose graph optimization time (78-80%), and exploration duration (10-15%). This region-based strategy with keyframe marginalization offers an efficient solution for autonomous robotic mapping.</p></details> | 8 pages, 9 figures |

In particular, we build upon our prior work on cooperative localization between an aerial drone and ground robot that fuses data from LiDAR, inertial navigation, peer-to-peer ranging, altimeter, and stereo-vision and evaluate the incorporation knowledge from the autopilot regarding when the drone is hovering. This control command data is leveraged to add constraints on the velocity state. Hover constraints can be considered important dynamic model information, such as the exploitation of zero-velocity updates in pedestrian navigation. We analyze the benefits of these constraints using an incremental factor graph optimization. Experimental data collected in a motion capture faculty is used to provide performance insights and assess the benefits of hover constraints.</p></details> |  |

We present a novel semantic SLAM approach that leverages road elements such as lane boundaries, traffic signs, and road markings to enhance localization accuracy. Our system integrates real-time semantic feature detection with a graph optimization framework, effectively handling both rolling-shutter effects and INS drift. Using a practical hardware setup which consists of a rolling-shutter camera (3840*2160@30fps), IMU (100Hz), and wheel encoder (50Hz), we demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods. Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, our method achieves higher recall (up to 5.35\%) and precision (up to 2.79\%) in semantic element detection, while maintaining mean relative error (MRE) within 10cm and mean absolute error (MAE) around 1m. Extensive experiments in diverse urban environments demonstrate the robust performance of our system under varying lighting conditions and complex traffic scenarios, making it particularly suitable for autonomous driving applications. The proposed approach provides a practical solution for high-precision localization using affordable hardware, bridging the gap between consumer-grade sensors and production-level performance requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE IV'25</p></details> |
| **[Robust simultaneous UWB-anchor calibration and robot localization for emergency situations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22272v1)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we propose a factor graph optimization (FGO) framework to simultaneously solve the calibration problem for Ultra-WideBand (UWB) anchors and the robot localization problem. Calibrating UWB anchors manually can be time-consuming and even impossible in emergencies or those situations without special calibration tools. Therefore, automatic estimation of the anchor positions becomes a necessity. The proposed method enables the creation of a soft sensor providing the position information of the anchors in a UWB network. This soft sensor requires only UWB and LiDAR measurements measured from a moving robot. The proposed FGO framework is suitable for the calibration of an extendable large UWB network. Moreover, the anchor calibration problem and robot localization problem can be solved simultaneously, which saves time for UWB network deployment. The proposed framework also helps to avoid artificial errors in the UWB-anchor position estimation and improves the accuracy and robustness of the robot-pose. The experimental results of the robot localization using LiDAR and a UWB network in a 3D environment are discussed, demonstrating the performance of the proposed method. More specifically, the anchor calibration problem with four anchors and the robot localization problem can be solved simultaneously and automatically within 30 seconds by the proposed framework.

However, dense point clouds face challenges of high memory consumption and reduced maintainability for long-term operations. In this study, we introduce SLIM, a scalable and lightweight mapping system for long-term LiDAR mapping in urban environments. The system begins by parameterizing structural point clouds into lines and planes. These lightweight and structural representations meet the requirements of map merging, pose graph optimization, and bundle adjustment, ensuring incremental management and local consistency. For long-term operations, a map-centric nonlinear factor recovery method is designed to sparsify poses while preserving mapping accuracy. We validate the SLIM system with multi-session real-world LiDAR data from classical LiDAR mapping datasets, including KITTI, NCLT, HeLiPR and M2DGR. The experiments demonstrate its capabilities in mapping accuracy, lightweightness, and scalability. Map re-use is also verified through map-based robot localization. Finally, with multi-session LiDAR data, the SLIM system provides a globally consistent map with low memory consumption (~130 KB/km on KITTI).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Robotics.

| **[DynOPETs: A Versatile Benchmark for Dynamic Object Pose Estimation and Tracking in Moving Camera Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19625v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the realm of object pose estimation, scenarios involving both dynamic objects and moving cameras are prevalent. However, the scarcity of corresponding real-world datasets significantly hinders the development and evaluation of robust pose estimation models. This is largely attributed to the inherent challenges in accurately annotating object poses in dynamic scenes captured by moving cameras. To bridge this gap, this paper presents a novel dataset DynOPETs and a dedicated data acquisition and annotation pipeline tailored for object pose estimation and tracking in such unconstrained environments. Our efficient annotation method innovatively integrates pose estimation and pose tracking techniques to generate pseudo-labels, which are subsequently refined through pose graph optimization. The resulting dataset offers accurate pose annotations for dynamic objects observed from moving cameras. To validate the effectiveness and value of our dataset, we perform comprehensive evaluations using 18 state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its potential to accelerate research in this challenging domain. The dataset will be made publicly available to facilitate further exploration and advancement in the field.</p></details> |  |
| **[MCVO: A Generic Visual Odometry for Arbitrarily Arranged Multi-Cameras](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03146v2)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Making multi-camera visual SLAM systems easier to set up and more robust to the environment is attractive for vision robots. Existing monocular and binocular vision SLAM systems have narrow sensing Field-of-View (FoV), resulting in degenerated accuracy and limited robustness in textureless environments. Thus multi-camera SLAM systems are gaining attention because they can provide redundancy with much wider FoV. However, the usual arbitrary placement and orientation of multiple cameras make the pose scale estimation and system updating challenging. To address these problems, we propose a robust visual odometry system for rigidly-bundled arbitrarily-arranged multi-cameras, namely MCVO, which can achieve metric-scale state estimation with high flexibility in the cameras' arrangement. Specifically, we first design a learning-based feature tracking framework to shift the pressure of CPU processing of multiple video streams to GPU. Then we initialize the odometry system with the metric-scale poses under the rigid constraints between moving cameras. Finally, we fuse the features of the multi-cameras in the back-end to achieve robust pose estimation and online scale optimization. Additionally, multi-camera features help improve the loop detection for pose graph optimization. Experiments on KITTI-360 and MultiCamData datasets validate its robustness over arbitrarily arranged cameras. Compared with other stereo and multi-camera visual SLAM systems, our method obtains higher pose accuracy with better generalization ability. Our codes and online demos are available at https://github.com/JunhaoWang615/MCVO</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |

We argue that latent codes stored in many NeRF SLAM systems are not fully exploited, as they are only used for better reconstruction. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective way to detect potential loops using the same latent codes as local features. To further improve the loop detection performance, we use the semantic information, which are also decoded from the same latent codes to guide the aggregation of local features. Finally, with the potential loops detected, we close them with a graph optimization followed by bundle adjustment to refine both the estimated poses and the reconstructed scene. To evaluate the performance of our SLC$^2$-SLAM, we conduct extensive experiments on Replica and ScanNet datasets. Our proposed semantic-guided loop closure significantly outperforms the pre-trained NetVLAD and ORB combined with Bag-of-Words, which are used in all the other NeRF SLAM with loop closure. As a result, our SLC$^2$-SLAM also demonstrated better tracking and reconstruction performance, especially in larger scenes with more loops, like ScanNet.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to RAL. 8 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

To overcome the shortcomings of standalone UWB systems in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios and the inherent drift associated with inertial navigation, we developed a novel hybrid fusion framework. First, a dynamic covariance estimation mechanism is incorporated, which automatically adjusts measurement weights based on real-time channel conditions. Then, a tightly-coupled sensor fusion architecture is employed, utilizing IMU pre-integration theory for temporal synchronization. Finally, a sliding-window factor graph optimization backend is utilized, incorporating NLOS mitigation constraints. Experimental results in complex indoor environments show a 38\% improvement in positioning accuracy compared to conventional Kalman filter-based approaches, achieving a 12.3 cm root mean square (RMS) error under dynamic motion conditions. The system maintains robust performance even with intermittent UWB signal availability, down to a 40\% packet reception rate, effectively suppressing IMU drift through multi-modal constraint fusion. This work offers a practical solution for applications that require reliable indoor positioning in GPS-denied environments.</p></details> |  |

Early 3D LiDAR SLAM methods often exploited additional information from IMU or GNSS sensors to enhance localization accuracy and mitigate drift. Later, advanced systems further improved the estimation at the cost of a higher runtime and complexity. This paper explores the limits of what can be achieved with a LiDAR-only SLAM approach while following the "Keep It Small and Simple" (KISS) principle. By leveraging this minimalistic design principle, our system, KISS-SLAM, archives state-of-the-art performances in pose accuracy while requiring little to no parameter tuning for deployment across diverse environments, sensors, and motion profiles. We follow best practices in graph-based SLAM and build upon LiDAR odometry to compute the relative motion between scans and construct local maps of the environment. To correct drift, we match local maps and optimize the trajectory in a pose graph optimization step. The experimental results demonstrate that this design achieves competitive performance while reducing complexity and reliance on additional sensor modalities. By prioritizing simplicity, this work provides a new strong baseline for LiDAR-only SLAM and a high-performing starting point for future research. Further, our pipeline builds consistent maps that can be used directly for further downstream tasks like navigation. Our open-source system operates faster than the sensor frame rate in all presented datasets and is designed for real-world scenarios.</p></details> | 8 pages |

Addressing these challenges, this paper introduces a novel, tightly-coupled Acoustic-Visual-Inertial SLAM approach, termed AQUA-SLAM, to fuse a Doppler Velocity Log (DVL), a stereo camera, and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) within a graph optimization framework. Moreover, we propose an efficient sensor calibration technique, encompassing multi-sensor extrinsic calibration (among the DVL, camera and IMU) and DVL transducer misalignment calibration, with a fast linear approximation procedure for real-time online execution. The proposed methods are extensively evaluated in a tank environment with ground truth, and validated for offshore applications in the North Sea. The results demonstrate that our method surpasses current state-of-the-art underwater and visual-inertial SLAM systems in terms of localization accuracy and robustness. The proposed system will be made open-source for the community.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Semantic Graphs for Efficient and Robust LiDAR SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11145v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and robust simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is crucial for autonomous mobile systems, typically achieved by leveraging the geometric features of the environment. Incorporating semantics provides a richer scene representation that not only enhances localization accuracy in SLAM but also enables advanced cognitive functionalities for downstream navigation and planning tasks. Existing point-wise semantic LiDAR SLAM methods often suffer from poor efficiency and generalization, making them less robust in diverse real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a semantic graph-enhanced SLAM framework, named SG-SLAM, which effectively leverages the geometric, semantic, and topological characteristics inherent in environmental structures. The semantic graph serves as a fundamental component that facilitates critical functionalities of SLAM, including robust relocalization during odometry failures, accurate loop closing, and semantic graph map construction. Our method employs a dual-threaded architecture, with one thread dedicated to online odometry and relocalization, while the other handles loop closure, pose graph optimization, and map update. This design enables our method to operate in real time and generate globally consistent semantic graph maps and point cloud maps. We extensively evaluate our method across the KITTI, MulRAN, and Apollo datasets, and the results demonstrate its superiority compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our method has been released at https://github.com/nubot-nudt/SG-SLAM.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Speedy MASt3R](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10017v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image matching is a key component of modern 3D vision algorithms, essential for accurate scene reconstruction and localization. MASt3R redefines image matching as a 3D task by leveraging DUSt3R and introducing a fast reciprocal matching scheme that accelerates matching by orders of magnitude while preserving theoretical guarantees. This approach has gained strong traction, with DUSt3R and MASt3R collectively cited over 250 times in a short span, underscoring their impact. However, despite its accuracy, MASt3R's inference speed remains a bottleneck. On an A40 GPU, latency per image pair is 198.16 ms, mainly due to computational overhead from the ViT encoder-decoder and Fast Reciprocal Nearest Neighbor (FastNN) matching. To address this, we introduce Speedy MASt3R, a post-training optimization framework that enhances inference efficiency while maintaining accuracy. It integrates multiple optimization techniques, including FlashMatch-an approach leveraging FlashAttention v2 with tiling strategies for improved efficiency, computation graph optimization via layer and tensor fusion having kernel auto-tuning with TensorRT (GraphFusion), and a streamlined FastNN pipeline that reduces memory access time from quadratic to linear while accelerating block-wise correlation scoring through vectorized computation (FastNN-Lite). Additionally, it employs mixed-precision inference with FP16/FP32 hybrid computations (HybridCast), achieving speedup while preserving numerical precision. Evaluated on Aachen Day-Night, InLoc, 7-Scenes, ScanNet1500, and MegaDepth1500, Speedy MASt3R achieves a 54% reduction in inference time (198 ms to 91 ms per image pair) without sacrificing accuracy. This advancement enables real-time 3D understanding, benefiting applications like mixed reality navigation and large-scale 3D scene reconstruction.</p></details> |  |

Compared to traditional geometric methods prioritizing texture-affluent features like edges, our keypoint selector employs the learned uncertainty to filter out the low-quality features based on global inconsistency. In contrast to the learning-based algorithms that model the scale-agnostic diagonal weight matrix for covariance, we design a metrics-aware covariance model to capture the spatial error during keypoint registration and the correlations between different axes. Integrating this covariance model into pose graph optimization enhances the robustness and reliability of pose estimation, particularly in challenging environments with varying illumination, feature density, and motion patterns. On public benchmark datasets, MAC-VO outperforms existing VO algorithms and even some SLAM algorithms in challenging environments. The covariance map also provides valuable information about the reliability of the estimated poses, which can benefit decision-making for autonomous systems.</p></details> |  |

This paper addresses the distributed pose graph optimization (PGO) problem under non-convex constraints, with the goal of approximating the rotation and translation of each pose given relevant noisy measurements. To achieve this goal, the splitting method based on the concepts of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and Bregman iteration are applied to solve the rotation subproblems. The proposed approach enables the iterative resolution of constrained problems, achieved through solving unconstrained problems and orthogonality-constrained quadratic problems that have analytical solutions. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared against two practical methods in pose graph optimization: the Distributed Gauss-Seidel (DGS) algorithm and the centralized pose graph optimizer with an optimality certificate (SE-Sync). The efficiency of the proposed method is verified through its application to several simulated and real-world pose graph datasets. Unlike the DGS method, our approach attempts to solve distributed PGO problems without relaxing the non-convex constraints.</p></details> | 20 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Optimizing Minimum Vertex Cover Solving via a GCN-assisted Heuristic Algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06396v1)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The problem of finding a minimum vertex cover (MVC) in a graph is a well-known NP-hard problem with significant practical applications in optimization and scheduling. Its complexity, combined with the increasing scale of problems, underscores the need for efficient and effective algorithms. However, existing heuristic algorithms for MVC often rely on simplistic initialization strategies and overlook the impact of edge attributes and neighborhood information on vertex selection. In this paper, we introduce GCNIVC, a novel heuristic search algorithm designed to address the limitations of existing methods for solving MVC problems in large-scale graphs. Our approach features two main innovations. First, it utilizes a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to capture the global structure of graphs, which enables the generation of high-quality initial solutions that enhance the efficiency of the subsequent search process. Second, GCNIVC introduces a new heuristic that employs three containers and the concept of double-covered edges (dc-edges), improving search efficiency and providing greater flexibility for adding and removing operations based on edge attributes. Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that GCNIVC outperforms state-of-the-art MVC algorithms in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. Our results highlight the effectiveness of GCNIVC's GCN-assisted initialization and its edge-informed search strategy. This study not only advances the understanding of MVC problem-solving but also contributes a new tool for addressing large-scale graph optimization challenges.</p></details> |  |

We investigate two learning strategies: offline learning for outlier prediction and online learning for noise distribution approximation, specifically applied to GNSS pseudorange observations. To develop and evaluate these learning methods, we introduce a novel multisensor state estimator that accurately and robustly estimates trajectory from multiple sensor inputs, critical for deriving GNSS measurement residuals used to train the uncertainty models. We validate the proposed learning-based models using real-world sensor data collected in diverse urban environments. Experimental results demonstrate that both models effectively handle GNSS outliers and improve state estimation performance. Furthermore, we provide insightful discussions to motivate future research toward developing a federated framework for robust vehicle localization in challenging environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This extended abstract has been accepted to the 1st German Robotic Conference</p></details> |

In the communication-constrained multi-agent setting, navigation systems increasingly use point-to-point range sensors as they afford measurements with low bandwidth requirements and known data association. The state estimation problem for these systems takes the form of range-aided (RA) SLAM. However, distributed algorithms for solving the RA-SLAM problem lack formal guarantees on the quality of the returned estimate. To this end, we present the first distributed algorithm for RA-SLAM that can efficiently recover certifiably globally optimal solutions. Our algorithm, distributed certifiably correct RA-SLAM (DCORA), achieves this via the Riemannian Staircase method, where computational procedures developed for distributed certifiably correct pose graph optimization are generalized to the RA-SLAM problem. We demonstrate DCORA's efficacy on real-world multi-agent datasets by achieving absolute trajectory errors comparable to those of a state-of-the-art centralized certifiably correct RA-SLAM algorithm. Additionally, we perform a parametric study on the structure of the RA-SLAM problem using synthetic data, revealing how common parameters affect DCORA's performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, accepted to 2025 International Conference on Robotics and Automation</p></details> |
| **[Impact of Temporal Delay on Radar-Inertial Odometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02509v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate ego-motion estimation is a critical component of any autonomous system. Conventional ego-motion sensors, such as cameras and LiDARs, may be compromised in adverse environmental conditions, such as fog, heavy rain, or dust. Automotive radars, known for their robustness to such conditions, present themselves as complementary sensors or a promising alternative within the ego-motion estimation frameworks. In this paper we propose a novel Radar-Inertial Odometry (RIO) system that integrates an automotive radar and an inertial measurement unit. The key contribution is the integration of online temporal delay calibration within the factor graph optimization framework that compensates for potential time offsets between radar and IMU measurements. To validate the proposed approach we have conducted thorough experimental analysis on real-world radar and IMU data. The results show that, even without scan matching or target tracking, integration of online temporal calibration significantly reduces localization error compared to systems that disregard time synchronization, thus highlighting the important role of, often neglected, accurate temporal alignment in radar-based sensor fusion systems for autonomous navigation.</p></details> |  |

Traditionally, these methods solve unconstrained least squares problems using algorithms such as Gauss-Newton and Levenberg-Marquardt. However, extending factor graphs with native support for equality constraints can improve solution accuracy and broaden their applicability, particularly in optimal control. In this paper, we propose a novel extension of factor graphs that seamlessly incorporates equality constraints without requiring additional optimization algorithms. Our approach maintains the efficiency and flexibility of existing second-order optimization techniques while ensuring constraint feasibility. To validate our method, we apply it to an optimal control problem for velocity tracking in autonomous vehicles and benchmark our results against state-of-the-art constraint handling techniques. Additionally, we introduce ecg2o, a header-only C++ library that extends the widely used g2o factor graph library by adding full support for equality-constrained optimization. This library, along with demonstrative examples and the optimal control problem, is available as open source at https://github.com/snt-arg/ecg2o</p></details> |  |
| **[Balancing Accuracy and Efficiency for Large-Scale SLAM: A Minimal Subset Approach for Scalable Loop Closures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01791v2)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Typical LiDAR SLAM architectures feature a front-end for odometry estimation and a back-end for refining and optimizing the trajectory and map, commonly through loop closures. However, loop closure detection in large-scale missions presents significant computational challenges due to the need to identify, verify, and process numerous candidate pairs for pose graph optimization. Keyframe sampling bridges the front-end and back-end by selecting frames for storing and processing during global optimization. This article proposes an online keyframe sampling approach that constructs the pose graph using the most impactful keyframes for loop closure. We introduce the Minimal Subset Approach (MSA), which optimizes two key objectives: redundancy minimization and information preservation, implemented within a sliding window framework. By operating in the feature space rather than 3-D space, MSA efficiently reduces redundant keyframes while retaining essential information. In sum, evaluations on diverse public datasets show that the proposed approach outperforms naive methods in reducing false positive rates in place recognition, while delivering superior ATE and RPE in metric localization, without the need for manual parameter tuning. Additionally, MSA demonstrates efficiency and scalability by reducing memory usage and computational overhead during loop closure detection and pose graph optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 Figures, 2 Tables.

For instance, when analyzing dynamic social networks, we may be interested in monitoring the evolution of a community that was identified at an earlier snapshot. This task requires finding a community in the current snapshot of data that is ``close'' to the earlier-discovered community of interest. However, classic optimization algorithms, which typically find solutions from scratch, potentially return communities that are very dissimilar to the initial one. To mitigate these issues, we introduce the \emph{OptiRefine framework}. The framework optimizes initial solutions by making a small number of \emph{refinements}, thereby ensuring that the new solution remains close to the initial solution and simultaneously achieving a near-optimal solution for the optimization problem. We apply the OptiRefine framework to two classic graph-optimization problems: \emph{densest subgraph} and \emph{maximum cut}. For the \emph{densest-subgraph problem}, we optimize a given subgraph's density by adding or removing $k$~nodes. We show that this novel problem is a generalization of $k$-densest subgraph, and provide constant-factor approximation algorithms for $k=\Omega(n)$~refinements. We also study a version of \emph{maximum cut} in which the goal is to improve a given cut. We provide connections to maximum cut with cardinality constraints and provide an optimal approximation algorithm in most parameter regimes under the Unique Games Conjecture for $k=\Omega(n)$~refinements. We evaluate our theoretical methods and scalable heuristics on synthetic and real-world data and show that they are highly effective in practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted under review.

FGO exhibits superior estimation accuracy compared with traditional state estimation methods that rely on least-squares or Kalman filters. However, only a few FGO libraries are specialized for GNSS observations. This paper introduces an open-source GNSS FGO package named gtsam\_gnss, which has a simple structure and can be easily applied to GNSS research and development. This package separates the preprocessing of GNSS observations from factor optimization. Moreover, it describes the error function of the GNSS factor in a straightforward manner, allowing for general-purpose inputs. This design facilitates the transition from ordinary least-squares-based positioning to FGO and supports user-specific GNSS research. In addition, gtsam\_gnss includes analytical examples involving various factors using GNSS data in real urban environments. This paper presents three application examples: the use of a robust error model, estimation of integer ambiguity in the carrier phase, and combination of GNSS and inertial measurements from smartphones. The proposed framework demonstrates excellent state estimation performance across all use cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 2025 IEEE/ION Position, Location and Navigation Symposium (PLANS)</p></details> |
| **[Graph Optimality-Aware Stochastic LiDAR Bundle Adjustment with Progressive Spatial Smoothing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14565v2)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale LiDAR Bundle Adjustment (LBA) to refine sensor orientation and point cloud accuracy simultaneously to build the navigation map is a fundamental task in logistics and robotics. Unlike pose-graph-based methods that rely solely on pairwise relationships between LiDAR frames, LBA leverages raw LiDAR correspondences to achieve more precise results, especially when initial pose estimates are unreliable for low-cost sensors. However, existing LBA methods face challenges such as simplistic planar correspondences, extensive observations, and dense normal matrices in the least-squares problem, which limit robustness, efficiency, and scalability. To address these issues, we propose a Graph Optimality-aware Stochastic Optimization scheme with Progressive Spatial Smoothing, namely PSS-GOSO, to achieve \textit{robust}, \textit{efficient}, and \textit{scalable} LBA. The Progressive Spatial Smoothing (PSS) module extracts \textit{robust} LiDAR feature association exploiting the prior structure information obtained by the polynomial smooth kernel. The Graph Optimality-aware Stochastic Optimization (GOSO) module first sparsifies the graph according to optimality for an \textit{efficient} optimization. GOSO then utilizes stochastic clustering and graph marginalization to solve the large-scale state estimation problem for a \textit{scalable} LBA. We validate PSS-GOSO across diverse scenes captured by various platforms, demonstrating its superior performance compared to existing methods. Moreover, the resulting point cloud maps are used for automatic last-mile delivery in large-scale complex scenes.

Many SLAM systems have been proposed in the last decade, but they are often complex to adapt to different settings or sensor setups. In this work, we present LiDAR Graph-SLAM (LG-SLAM), a versatile range-inertial SLAM framework that can be adapted to different types of sensors and environments, from underground mines to offices with minimal parameter tuning. Our system integrates range, inertial and GNSS measurements into a graph-based optimization framework. We also use a refined submap management approach and a robust loop closure method that effectively accounts for uncertainty in the identification and validation of putative loop closures, ensuring global consistency and robustness. Enabled by a parallelized architecture and GPU integration, our system achieves pose estimation at LiDAR frame rate, along with online loop closing and graph optimization. We validate our system in diverse environments using public datasets and real-world data, consistently achieving an average error below 20 cm and outperforming other state-of-the-art algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

However, during the execution of a MAPF plan, agents may encounter unexpected delays, which can lead to inefficiencies, deadlocks, or even collisions. To address these issues, the Switchable Temporal Plan Graph provides a framework for finding an acyclic Temporal Plan Graph with the minimum execution cost under delays, ensuring deadlock- and collision-free execution. Unfortunately, existing optimal algorithms, such as Mixed Integer Linear Programming and Graph-Based Switchable Edge Search (GSES), are often too slow for practical use. This paper introduces Improved GSES, which significantly accelerates GSES through four speedup techniques: stronger admissible heuristics, edge grouping, prioritized branching, and incremental implementation. Experiments conducted on four different map types with varying numbers of agents demonstrate that Improved GSES consistently achieves over twice the success rate of GSES and delivers up to a 30-fold speedup on instances where both methods successfully find solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025.

In particular, it is crucial to plan a path to avoid risky terrain and reach the goal quickly and safely. In this paper, we propose a method for safe and distance-efficient path planning, leveraging Traversal Risk Graph (TRG), a novel graph representation that takes into account geometric traversability of the terrain. TRG nodes represent stability and reachability of the terrain, while edges represent relative traversal risk-weighted path candidates. Additionally, TRG is constructed in a wavefront propagation manner and managed hierarchically, enabling real-time planning even in large-scale environments. Lastly, we formulate a graph optimization problem on TRG that leads the robot to navigate by prioritizing both safe and short paths. Our approach demonstrated superior safety, distance efficiency, and fast processing time compared to the conventional methods. It was also validated in several real-world experiments using a quadrupedal robot. Notably, TRG-planner contributed as the global path planner of an autonomous navigation framework for the DreamSTEP team, which won the Quadruped Robot Challenge at ICRA 2023.

| **[Tightly Joined Positioning and Control Model for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Based on Factor Graph Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14724v2)** | 2024-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The execution of flight missions by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) primarily relies on navigation. In particular, the navigation pipeline has traditionally been divided into positioning and control, operating in a sequential loop. However, the existing navigation pipeline, where the positioning and control are decoupled, struggles to adapt to ubiquitous uncertainties arising from measurement noise, abrupt disturbances, and nonlinear dynamics. As a result, the navigation reliability of the UAV is significantly challenged in complex dynamic areas. For example, the ubiquitous global navigation satellite system (GNSS) positioning can be degraded by the signal reflections from surrounding high-rising buildings in complex urban areas, leading to significantly increased positioning uncertainty. An additional challenge is introduced to the control algorithm due to the complex wind disturbances in urban canyons. Given the fact that the system positioning and control are highly correlated with each other, this research proposes a **tightly joined positioning and control model (JPCM) based on factor graph optimization (FGO)**. In particular, the proposed JPCM combines sensor measurements from positioning and control constraints into a unified probabilistic factor graph. Specifically, the positioning measurements are formulated as the factors in the factor graph. In addition, the model predictive control (MPC) is also formulated as the additional factors in the factor graph. By solving the factor graph contributed by both the positioning-related factors and the MPC-based factors, the complementariness of positioning and control can be deeply exploited. Finally, we validate the effectiveness and resilience of the proposed method using a simulated quadrotor system which shows significantly improved trajectory following performance.</p></details> |  |

Developers usually develop several smart contracts into one project, implementing complex logic functions and multiple transaction operations. However, the interaction among these contracts poses challenges for developers analyzing the state logic. Due to the complex state logic in DEX projects, many critical state derailment defects have emerged in recent years. In this paper, we conduct the first systematic study of state derailment defects in DEX. We define five categories of state derailment defects and provide detailed analyses of them. Furthermore, we propose a novel deep learning-based framework StateGuard for detecting state derailment defects in DEX smart contracts. It leverages a smart contract deconstructor to deconstruct the contract into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), from which five categories of dependency features are extracted. Next, it implements a graph optimizer to process the structured data. At last, the optimized data is analyzed by Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to identify potential state derailment defects. We evaluated StateGuard through a dataset of 46 DEX projects containing 5,671 smart contracts, and it achieved 94.25% F1-score. In addition, in a comparison experiment with state-of-the-art, StateGuard leads the F1-score by 6.29%. To further verify its practicality, we used StateGuar to audit real-world contracts and successfully authenticated multiple novel CVEs.</p></details> | 13 pages |
| **[Challenges of Generating Structurally Diverse Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18859v2)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For many graph-related problems, it can be essential to have a set of structurally diverse graphs. For instance, such graphs can be used for testing graph algorithms or their neural approximations. However, to the best of our knowledge, the problem of generating structurally diverse graphs has not been explored in the literature. In this paper, we fill this gap. First, we discuss how to define diversity for a set of graphs, why this task is non-trivial, and how one can choose a proper diversity measure. Then, for a given diversity measure, we propose and compare several algorithms optimizing it: we consider approaches based on standard random graph models, local graph optimization, genetic algorithms, and neural generative models. We show that it is possible to significantly improve diversity over basic random graph generators. Additionally, our analysis of generated graphs allows us to better understand the properties of graph distances: depending on which diversity measure is used for optimization, the obtained graphs may possess very different structural properties which gives a better understanding of the graph distance underlying the diversity measure.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards a Converged Relational-Graph Optimization Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13480v3)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent ISO SQL:2023 standard adopts SQL/PGQ (Property Graph Queries), facilitating graph-like querying within relational databases. This advancement, however, underscores a significant gap in how to effectively optimize SQL/PGQ queries within relational database systems. To address this gap, we extend the foundational SPJ (Select-Project-Join) queries to SPJM queries, which include an additional matching operator for representing graph pattern matching in SQL/PGQ. Although SPJM queries can be converted to SPJ queries and optimized using existing relational query optimizers, our analysis shows that such a graph-agnostic method fails to benefit from graph-specific optimization techniques found in the literature. To address this issue, we develop a converged relational-graph optimization framework called RelGo for optimizing SPJM queries, leveraging joint efforts from both relational and graph query optimizations. Using DuckDB as the underlying relational execution engine, our experiments show that RelGo can generate efficient execution plans for SPJM queries. On well-established benchmarks, these plans exhibit an average speedup of 21.90x compared to those produced by the graph-agnostic optimizer.</p></details> |  |

However, UAVs heavily rely on global navigation satellite system (GNSS) for localization which works well in open spaces, but the precision drastically degrades in the vicinity of buildings. These inaccuracies hinder aggregation of diverse data from multiple sources in a unified georeferenced frame for SAR operators. In contrast, CityGML models provide approximate building shapes with accurate georeferenced poses. Besides, LiDAR works best in the vicinity of 3D structures. Hence, we refine coarse GNSS measurements by registering LiDAR maps against CityGML and digital elevation map (DEM) models as a prior for allocentric mapping. An intuitive plausibility score selects the best hypothesis based on occupancy using a 2D height map. Afterwards, we integrate the registration results in a continuous-time spline-based pose graph optimizer with LiDAR odometry and further sensing modalities to obtain globally consistent, georeferenced trajectories and maps. We evaluate the viability of our approach on multiple flights captured at two distinct testing sites. Our method successfully reduced GNSS offset errors from up-to 16 m to below 0.5 m on multiple flights. Furthermore, we obtain globally consistent maps w.r.t. prior 3D geospatial models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at IEEE International Symposium on Safety, Security, and Rescue Robotics (SSRR), New York City, USA, November 2024</p></details> |
| **[LiDAR SLAMMOT based on Confidence-guided Data Association](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01041v1)** | 2024-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the field of autonomous driving or robotics, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and multi-object tracking (MOT) are two fundamental problems and are generally applied separately. Solutions to SLAM and MOT usually rely on certain assumptions, such as the static environment assumption for SLAM and the accurate ego-vehicle pose assumption for MOT. But in complex dynamic environments, it is difficult or even impossible to meet these assumptions. Therefore, the SLAMMOT, i.e., simultaneous localization, mapping, and moving object tracking, integrated system of SLAM and object tracking, has emerged for autonomous vehicles in dynamic environments. However, many conventional SLAMMOT solutions directly perform data association on the predictions and detections for object tracking, but ignore their quality. In practice, inaccurate predictions caused by continuous multi-frame missed detections in temporary occlusion scenarios, may degrade the performance of tracking, thereby affecting SLAMMOT. To address this challenge, this paper presents a LiDAR SLAMMOT based on confidence-guided data association (Conf SLAMMOT) method, which tightly couples the LiDAR SLAM and the confidence-guided data association based multi-object tracking into a graph optimization backend for estimating the state of the ego-vehicle and objects simultaneously. The confidence of prediction and detection are applied in the factor graph-based multi-object tracking for its data association, which not only avoids the performance degradation caused by incorrect initial assignments in some filter-based methods but also handles issues such as continuous missed detection in tracking while also improving the overall performance of SLAMMOT. Various comparative experiments demonstrate the superior advantages of Conf SLAMMOT, especially in scenes with some missed detections.</p></details> |  |
| **[Utilizing Graph Generation for Enhanced Domain Adaptive Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06535v3)** | 2024-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The problem of Domain Adaptive in the field of Object Detection involves the transfer of object detection models from labeled source domains to unannotated target domains. Recent advancements in this field aim to address domain discrepancies by aligning pixel-pairs across domains within a non-Euclidean graphical space, thereby minimizing semantic distribution variance. Despite their remarkable achievements, these methods often use coarse semantic representations to model graphs, mainly due to ignoring non-informative elements and failing to focus on precise semantic alignment. Additionally, the generation of coarse graphs inherently introduces abnormal nodes, posing challenges and potentially biasing domain adaptation outcomes. Consequently, we propose a framework, which utilizes the Graph Generation to enhance the quality of DAOD (\method{}). Specifically, we introduce a Node Refinement module that utilizes a memory bank to reconstruct noisy sampled nodes while applying contrastive regularization to noisy features. To enhance semantic alignment, we propose separating domain-specific styles from category invariance encoded within graph covariances, which allows us to selectively remove domain-specific styles while preserving category-invariant information, thus facilitating more accurate semantic alignment across different domains. Furthermore, we propose a Graph Optimization adaptor, leveraging variational inference to mitigate the impact of abnormal nodes. Extensive experimentation across three adaptation benchmarks validates that \method{} achieves state-of-the-art performance in the task of unsupervised domain adaptation.</p></details> |  |

Integrity monitoring (IM) capability is required when FGO-based integrated navigation system is used for safety-critical applications. However, traditional researches on IM of integrated navigation system are mostly based on Kalman filter. It is urgent to develop effective IM scheme for FGO-based GNSS/INS/Vision integration. In this contribution, the position error bounding formula to ensure the integrity of the GNSS/INS/Vision integration based on FGO is designed and validated for the first time. It can be calculated by the linearized equations from the residuals of GNSS pseudo-range, IMU pre-integration and visual measurements. The specific position error bounding is given in the case of GNSS, INS and visual measurement faults. Field experiments were conducted to evaluate and validate the performance of the proposed position error bounding. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed position error bounding for the GNSS/INS/Vision integration based on FGO can correctly fit the position error against different fault modes, and the availability of integrity in six fault modes is 100% after correct and timely fault exclusion.</p></details> |  |

Compared to existing public datasets that primarily offer raw images, Open-Structure provides direct access to point and line measurements, correspondences, structural associations, and co-visibility factor graphs, which can be fed to various stages of SLAM pipelines to mitigate the impact of data preprocessing modules in ablation experiments. The dataset comprises two distinct types of sequences from the perspective of scenarios. The first type maintains reasonable observation and occlusion relationships, as these critical elements are extracted from public image-based sequences using our dataset generator. In contrast, the second type consists of carefully designed simulation sequences that enhance dataset diversity by introducing a wide range of trajectories and observations. Furthermore, a baseline is proposed using our dataset to evaluate widely used modules, including camera pose tracking, parametrization, and factor graph optimization, within SLAM systems.

| **[Gravity-aligned Rotation Averaging with Circular Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12763v1)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing a 3D scene from unordered images is pivotal in computer vision and robotics, with applications spanning crowd-sourced mapping and beyond. While global Structure-from-Motion (SfM) techniques are scalable and fast, they often compromise on accuracy. To address this, we introduce a principled approach that integrates gravity direction into the rotation averaging phase of global pipelines, enhancing camera orientation accuracy and reducing the degrees of freedom. This additional information is commonly available in recent consumer devices, such as smartphones, mixed-reality devices and drones, making the proposed method readily accessible. Rooted in circular regression, our algorithm has similar convergence guarantees as linear regression. It also supports scenarios where only a subset of cameras have known gravity. Additionally, we propose a mechanism to refine error-prone gravity. We achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on four large-scale datasets. Particularly, the proposed method improves upon the SfM baseline by 13 AUC@$1^\circ$ points, on average, while running eight times faster. It also outperforms the standard planar pose graph optimization technique by 23 AUC@$1^\circ$ points. The code is at https://github.com/colmap/glomap.</p></details> | accepted at ECCV2024 |
| **[Data Interpreter: An LLM Agent For Data Science](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18679v4)** | 2024-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have shown effectiveness across many applications. However, their use in data science scenarios requiring solving long-term interconnected tasks, dynamic data adjustments and domain expertise remains challenging. Previous approaches primarily focus on individual tasks, making it difficult to assess the complete data science workflow. Moreover, they struggle to handle real-time changes in intermediate data and fail to adapt dynamically to evolving task dependencies inherent to data science problems. In this paper, we present Data Interpreter, an LLM-based agent designed to automatically solve various data science problems end-to-end. Our Data Interpreter incorporates two key modules: 1) Hierarchical Graph Modeling, which breaks down complex problems into manageable subproblems, enabling dynamic node generation and graph optimization; and 2) Programmable Node Generation, a technique that refines and verifies each subproblem to iteratively improve code generation results and robustness. Extensive experiments consistently demonstrate the superiority of Data Interpreter. On InfiAgent-DABench, it achieves a 25% performance boost, raising accuracy from 75.9% to 94.9%. For machine learning and open-ended tasks, it improves performance from 88% to 95%, and from 60% to 97%, respectively. Moreover, on the MATH dataset, Data Interpreter achieves remarkable performance with a 26% improvement compared to state-of-the-art baselines. The code is available at https://github.com/geekan/MetaGPT.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interdependency Matters: Graph Alignment for Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08877v1)** | 2024-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection in multivariate time series (MTS) is crucial for various applications in data mining and industry. Current industrial methods typically approach anomaly detection as an unsupervised learning task, aiming to identify deviations by estimating the normal distribution in noisy, label-free datasets. These methods increasingly incorporate interdependencies between channels through graph structures to enhance accuracy. However, the role of interdependencies is more critical than previously understood, as shifts in interdependencies between MTS channels from normal to anomalous data are significant. This observation suggests that \textit{anomalies could be detected by changes in these interdependency graph series}. To capitalize on this insight, we introduce MADGA (MTS Anomaly Detection via Graph Alignment), which redefines anomaly detection as a graph alignment (GA) problem that explicitly utilizes interdependencies for anomaly detection. MADGA dynamically transforms subsequences into graphs to capture the evolving interdependencies, and Graph alignment is performed between these graphs, optimizing an alignment plan that minimizes cost, effectively minimizing the distance for normal data and maximizing it for anomalous data. Uniquely, our GA approach involves explicit alignment of both nodes and edges, employing Wasserstein distance for nodes and Gromov-Wasserstein distance for edges. To our knowledge, this is the first application of GA to MTS anomaly detection that explicitly leverages interdependency for this purpose. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of MADGA, demonstrating its capability to detect anomalies and differentiate interdependencies, consistently achieving state-of-the-art across various scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Factor Graph Optimization of Error-Correcting Codes for Belief Propagation Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12900v2)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The design of optimal linear block codes capable of being efficiently decoded is of major concern, especially for short block lengths. As near capacity-approaching codes, Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes possess several advantages over other families of codes, the most notable being its efficient decoding via Belief Propagation. While many LDPC code design methods exist, the development of efficient sparse codes that meet the constraints of modern short code lengths and accommodate new channel models remains a challenge. In this work, we propose for the first time a gradient-based data-driven approach for the design of sparse codes. We develop locally optimal codes with respect to Belief Propagation decoding via the learning of the Factor graph under channel noise simulations. This is performed via a novel complete graph tensor representation of the Belief Propagation algorithm, optimized over finite fields via backpropagation and coupled with an efficient line-search method. The proposed approach is shown to outperform the decoding performance of existing popular codes by orders of magnitude and demonstrates the power of data-driven approaches for code design.</p></details> |  |

We evaluate AutoBIND on Alzhiemer's disease detection because it has real-world medical applicability and it contains a broad range of data modalities. We show that AutoBIND outperforms previous methods on this task, highlighting the generalizablility of the approach.</p></details> |  |

However, this task is often hindered by the limited availability of densely annotated surgical scene data. In this work, we introduce an end-to-end framework for the generation and optimization of surgical scene graphs on a downstream task. Our approach leverages the flexibility of graph-based spectral clustering and the generalization capability of foundation models to generate unsupervised scene graphs with learnable properties. We reinforce the initial spatial graph with sparse temporal connections using local matches between consecutive frames to predict temporally consistent clusters across a temporal neighborhood. By jointly optimizing the spatiotemporal relations and node features of the dynamic scene graph with the downstream task of phase segmentation, we address the costly and annotation-burdensome task of semantic scene comprehension and scene graph generation in surgical videos using only weak surgical phase labels. Further, by incorporating effective intermediate scene representation disentanglement steps within the pipeline, our solution outperforms the SOTA on the CATARACTS dataset by 8% accuracy and 10% F1 score in surgical workflow recognition</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables, MICCAI GRAIL Workshop paper</p></details> |
| **[Robust Gaussian Splatting SLAM by Leveraging Loop Closure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20111v1)** | 2024-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting algorithms excel in novel view rendering applications and have been adapted to extend the capabilities of traditional SLAM systems. However, current Gaussian Splatting SLAM methods, designed mainly for hand-held RGB or RGB-D sensors, struggle with tracking drifts when used with rotating RGB-D camera setups. In this paper, we propose a robust Gaussian Splatting SLAM architecture that utilizes inputs from rotating multiple RGB-D cameras to achieve accurate localization and photorealistic rendering performance. The carefully designed Gaussian Splatting Loop Closure module effectively addresses the issue of accumulated tracking and mapping errors found in conventional Gaussian Splatting SLAM systems. First, each Gaussian is associated with an anchor frame and categorized as historical or novel based on its timestamp. By rendering different types of Gaussians at the same viewpoint, the proposed loop detection strategy considers both co-visibility relationships and distinct rendering outcomes. Furthermore, a loop closure optimization approach is proposed to remove camera pose drift and maintain the high quality of 3D Gaussian models. The approach uses a lightweight pose graph optimization algorithm to correct pose drift and updates Gaussians based on the optimized poses. Additionally, a bundle adjustment scheme further refines camera poses using photometric and geometric constraints, ultimately enhancing the global consistency of scenarios. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in camera pose estimation and novel view rendering tasks. The code will be open-sourced for the community.</p></details> |  |

Efficient, accurate self and mutual state estimation are the critical preconditions for completing these swarm tasks, which remain challenging research topics. This paper proposes Swarm-LIO2: a fully decentralized, plug-and-play, computationally efficient, and bandwidth-efficient LiDAR-inertial odometry for aerial swarm systems. Swarm-LIO2 uses a decentralized, plug-and-play network as the communication infrastructure. Only bandwidth-efficient and low-dimensional information is exchanged, including identity, ego-state, mutual observation measurements, and global extrinsic transformations. To support the plug-and-play of new teammate participants, Swarm-LIO2 detects potential teammate UAVs and initializes the temporal offset and global extrinsic transformation all automatically. To enhance the initialization efficiency, novel reflectivity-based UAV detection, trajectory matching, and factor graph optimization methods are proposed. For state estimation, Swarm-LIO2 fuses LiDAR, IMU, and mutual observation measurements within an efficient ESIKF framework, with careful compensation of temporal delay and modeling of measurements to enhance the accuracy and consistency.</p></details> | 23 Pages |

To this end, we introduce Walker, the first self-supervised tracker that learns from videos with sparse bounding box annotations, and no tracking labels. First, we design a quasi-dense temporal object appearance graph, and propose a novel multi-positive contrastive objective to optimize random walks on the graph and learn instance similarities. Then, we introduce an algorithm to enforce mutually-exclusive connective properties across instances in the graph, optimizing the learned topology for MOT. At inference time, we propose to associate detected instances to tracklets based on the max-likelihood transition state under motion-constrained bi-directional walks. Walker is the first self-supervised tracker to achieve competitive performance on MOT17, DanceTrack, and BDD100K. Remarkably, our proposal outperforms the previous self-supervised trackers even when drastically reducing the annotation requirements by up to 400x.</p></details> | ECCV 2024 |
| **[CF-GO-Net: A Universal Distribution Learner via Characteristic Function Networks with Graph Optimizers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12610v1)** | 2024-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models aim to learn the distribution of datasets, such as images, so as to be able to generate samples that statistically resemble real data. However, learning the underlying probability distribution can be very challenging and intractable. To this end, we introduce an approach which employs the characteristic function (CF), a probabilistic descriptor that directly corresponds to the distribution. However, unlike the probability density function (pdf), the characteristic function not only always exists, but also provides an additional degree of freedom, hence enhances flexibility in learning distributions. This removes the critical dependence on pdf-based assumptions, which limit the applicability of traditional methods. While several works have attempted to use CF in generative modeling, they often impose strong constraints on the training process. In contrast, our approach calculates the distance between query points in the CF domain, which is an unconstrained and well defined problem. Next, to deal with the sampling strategy, which is crucial to model performance, we propose a graph neural network (GNN)-based optimizer for the sampling process, which identifies regions where the difference between CFs is most significant. In addition, our method allows the use of a pre-trained model, such as a well-trained autoencoder, and is capable of learning directly in its feature space, without modifying its parameters. This offers a flexible and robust approach to generative modeling, not only provides broader applicability and improved performance, but also equips any latent space world with the ability to become a generative model.</p></details> |  |
| **[UniMSF: A Unified Multi-Sensor Fusion Framework for Intelligent Transportation System Global Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12426v1)** | 2024-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) localization is of significant importance as it provides fundamental position and orientation for autonomous operations like intelligent vehicles. Integrating diverse and complementary sensors such as global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and 4D-radar can provide scalable and reliable global localization. Nevertheless, multi-sensor fusion encounters challenges including heterogeneity and time-varying uncertainty in measurements. Consequently, developing a reliable and unified multi-sensor framework remains challenging. In this paper, we introduce UniMSF, a comprehensive multi-sensor fusion localization framework for ITS, utilizing factor graphs. By integrating a multi-sensor fusion front-end, alongside outlier detection\&noise model estimation, and a factor graph optimization back-end, this framework accomplishes efficient fusion and ensures accurate localization for ITS. Specifically, in the multi-sensor fusion front-end module, we tackle the measurement heterogeneity among different modality sensors and establish effective measurement models. Reliable outlier detection and data-driven online noise estimation methods ensure that back-end optimization is immune to interference from outlier measurements. In addition, integrating multi-sensor observations via factor graph optimization offers the advantage of \enquote{plug and play}. Notably, our framework features high modularity and is seamlessly adapted to various sensor configurations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework through real vehicle tests by tightly integrating GNSS pseudorange and carrier phase information with IMU, and 4D-radar.</p></details> |  |

However, the pose-only solution has not yet been properly considered in a tightly-coupled visual-inertial state estimator (VISE) with a normal configuration for real-time navigation. In this study, we propose a tightly-coupled LiDAR-enhanced VISE, named PO-VINS, with a full pose-only form for visual and LiDAR-depth measurements. Based on the pose-only visual representation, we derive the analytical depth uncertainty, which is then employed for rejecting LiDAR depth outliers. Besides, we propose a multi-state constraint (MSC)-based LiDAR-depth measurement model with a pose-only form, to balance efficiency and robustness. The pose-only visual and LiDAR-depth measurements and the IMU-preintegration measurements are tightly integrated under the factor graph optimization framework to perform efficient and accurate state estimation. Exhaustive experimental results on private and public datasets indicate that the proposed PO-VINS yields improved or comparable accuracy to sate-of-the-art methods. Compared to the baseline method LE-VINS, the state-estimation efficiency of PO-VINS is improved by 33% and 56% on the laptop PC and the onboard ARM computer, respectively. Besides, PO-VINS yields higher accuracy and robustness than LE-VINS by employing the proposed uncertainty-based outlier-culling method and the MSC-based measurement model for LiDAR depth.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 13 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

However, the ethnic disparity in these models' predictions needs to be addressed before deploying them. We introduce a novel approach, PatchAlign, to enhance skin condition image classification accuracy and fairness by aligning with clinical text representations of skin conditions. PatchAlign uses Graph Optimal Transport (GOT) Loss as a regularizer to perform cross-domain alignment. The representations obtained are robust and generalize well across skin tones, even with limited training samples. To reduce the effect of noise and artifacts in clinical dermatology images, we propose a learnable Masked Graph Optimal Transport for cross-domain alignment that further improves fairness metrics. We compare our model to the state-of-the-art FairDisCo on two skin lesion datasets with different skin types: Fitzpatrick17k and Diverse Dermatology Images (DDI). PatchAlign enhances the accuracy of skin condition image classification by 2.8% (in-domain) and 6.2% (out-domain) on Fitzpatrick17k, and 4.2% (in-domain) on DDI compared to FairDisCo. Additionally, it consistently improves the fairness of true positive rates across skin tones.

In particular, a critical element of the vision-based navigation system is tracking surgical instruments. Compared with 2D instrument tracking methods, 3D instrument tracking has broader value in clinical practice, but is also more challenging due to weak texture, occlusion, and lack of Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models for 3D registration. To solve these challenges, we propose the SurgTrack, a two-stage 3D instrument tracking method for CAD-free and robust real-world applications. In the first registration stage, we incorporate an Instrument Signed Distance Field (SDF) modeling the 3D representation of instruments, achieving CAD-freed 3D registration. Due to this, we can obtain the location and orientation of instruments in the 3D space by matching the video stream with the registered SDF model. In the second tracking stage, we devise a posture graph optimization module, leveraging the historical tracking results of the posture memory pool to optimize the tracking results and improve the occlusion robustness. Furthermore, we collect the Instrument3D dataset to comprehensively evaluate the 3D tracking of surgical instruments. The extensive experiments validate the superiority and scalability of our SurgTrack, by outperforming the state-of-the-arts with a remarkable improvement.

However, existing 3DGS-based methods fail to address the global consistency of the scene via loop closure and/or global bundle adjustment. To this end, we propose LoopSplat, which takes RGB-D images as input and performs dense mapping with 3DGS submaps and frame-to-model tracking. LoopSplat triggers loop closure online and computes relative loop edge constraints between submaps directly via 3DGS registration, leading to improvements in efficiency and accuracy over traditional global-to-local point cloud registration. It uses a robust pose graph optimization formulation and rigidly aligns the submaps to achieve global consistency. Evaluation on the synthetic Replica and real-world TUM-RGBD, ScanNet, and ScanNet++ datasets demonstrates competitive or superior tracking, mapping, and rendering compared to existing methods for dense RGB-D SLAM.

This paper proposes a Tracklet Graph and Query Graph-based framework, i.e., GSLAMOT, to address this challenge. GSLAMOT utilizes camera and LiDAR multimodal information as inputs and divides the representation of the dynamic scene into a semantic map for representing the static environment, a trajectory of the ego-agent, and an online maintained Tracklet Graph (TG) for tracking and predicting the 3D poses of the detected mobile objects. A Query Graph (QG) is constructed in each frame by object detection to query and update TG. For accurate object association, a Multi-criteria Star Graph Association (MSGA) method is proposed to find matched objects between the detections in QG and the predicted tracklets in TG. Then, an Object-centric Graph Optimization (OGO) method is proposed to simultaneously optimize the TG, the semantic map, and the agent trajectory. It triangulates the detected objects into the map to enrich the map's semantic information. We address the efficiency issues to handle the three tightly coupled tasks in parallel. Experiments are conducted on KITTI, Waymo, and an emulated Traffic Congestion dataset that highlights challenging scenarios. Experiments show that GSLAMOT enables accurate crowded object tracking while conducting SLAM accurately in challenging scenarios, demonstrating more excellent performances than the state-of-the-art methods.

The optimization procedure can be negatively affected even by a single outlier measurement, with possible catastrophic and meaningless results. Although recent works on robust optimization aim to mitigate the presence of outlier measurements, robust solutions capable of handling large numbers of outliers are yet to come. This paper presents IPC, acronym for Incremental Probabilistic Consensus, a method that approximates the solution to the combinatorial problem of finding the maximally consistent set of measurements in an incremental fashion. It evaluates the consistency of each loop closure measurement through a consensus-based procedure, possibly applied to a subset of the global problem, where all previously integrated inlier measurements have veto power. We evaluated IPC on standard benchmarks against several state-of-the-art methods. Although it is simple and relatively easy to implement, IPC competes with or outperforms the other tested methods in handling outliers while providing online performances. We release with this paper an open-source implementation of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication at the 2024 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)</p></details> |

In this paper, we represent the rotation and translation by a unit quaternion and a three-dimensional vector, and propose a new PGO model based on the von Mises-Fisher distribution. The constraints derived from the unit quaternions are spherical manifolds, and the projection onto the constraints can be calculated by normalization. Then a proximal linearized Riemannian alternating direction method of multipliers (PieADMM) is developed to solve the proposed model, which not only has low memory requirements, but also can update the poses in parallel. Furthermore, we establish the iteration complexity of $O(1/\epsilon^{2})$ of PieADMM for finding an $\epsilon$-stationary solution of our model. The efficiency of our proposed algorithm is demonstrated by numerical experiments on two synthetic and four 3D SLAM benchmark datasets.</p></details> |  |

The state-of-the-art approaches usually employ a tracking-by-detection method, and data association plays a critical role. This paper proposes a learning and graph-optimized (LEGO) modular tracker to improve data association performance in the existing literature. The proposed LEGO tracker integrates graph optimization and self-attention mechanisms, which efficiently formulate the association score map, facilitating the accurate and efficient matching of objects across time frames. To further enhance the state update process, the Kalman filter is added to ensure consistent tracking by incorporating temporal coherence in the object states.

However, it has not yet been properly considered and studied for LiDAR-based odometry. In this paper, we propose a novel tightly coupled LiDAR-inertial odometry based on the MSCKF framework, named MSC-LIO. An efficient LiDAR same-plane-point (LSPP) tracking method, without explicit feature extraction, is present for frame-to-frame data associations. The tracked LSPPs are employed to build an LSPP measurement model, which constructs a multi-state constraint. Besides, we propose an effective point-velocity-based LiDAR-IMU time-delay (LITD) estimation method, which is derived from the proposed LSPP tracking method. Extensive experiments were conducted on both public and private datasets. The results demonstrate that the proposed MSC-LIO yields higher accuracy and efficiency than the state-of-the-art methods. The ablation experiment results indicate that the data-association efficiency is improved by nearly 3 times using the LSPP tracking method.

However, existing approaches often struggle with data redundancy, robustness, and accuracy in complex environments. To address these challenges, we present MS-Mapping, an novel multi-session LiDAR mapping system that employs an incremental mapping scheme for robust and accurate map assembly in large-scale environments. Our approach introduces three key innovations: 1) A distribution-aware keyframe selection method that captures the subtle contributions of each point cloud frame to the map by analyzing the similarity of map distributions. This method effectively reduces data redundancy and pose graph size, while enhancing graph optimization speed; 2) An uncertainty model that automatically performs least-squares adjustments according to the covariance matrix during graph optimization, improving mapping precision, robustness, and flexibility without the need for scene-specific parameter tuning. This uncertainty model enables our system to monitor pose uncertainty and avoid ill-posed optimizations, thereby increasing adaptability to diverse and challenging environments. 3) To ensure fair evaluation, we redesign baseline comparisons and the evaluation benchmark. Direct assessment of map accuracy demonstrates the superiority of the proposed MS-Mapping algorithm compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Sensors are often corrupted in those complicated and large-scale environments. This paper introduces GNSS-FGO, an online and global trajectory estimator that fuses GNSS observations alongside multiple sensor measurements for robust vehicle localization. In GNSS-FGO, we fuse asynchronous sensor measurements into the graph with a continuous-time trajectory representation using Gaussian process regression. This enables querying states at arbitrary timestamps so that sensor observations are fused without requiring strict state and measurement synchronization. Thus, the proposed method presents a generalized factor graph for multi-sensor fusion. To evaluate and study different GNSS fusion strategies, we fuse GNSS measurements in loose and tight coupling with a speed sensor, IMU, and lidar-odometry. We employed datasets from measurement campaigns in Aachen, Duesseldorf, and Cologne in experimental studies and presented comprehensive discussions on sensor observations, smoother types, and hyperparameter tuning. Our results show that the proposed approach enables robust trajectory estimation in dense urban areas, where the classic multi-sensor fusion method fails due to sensor degradation. In a test sequence containing a 17km route through Aachen, the proposed method results in a mean 2D positioning error of 0.48m while fusing raw GNSS observations with lidar odometry in a tight coupling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the IEEE Transactions on Robotics</p></details> |
| **[RoCo:Robust Collaborative Perception By Iterative Object Matching and Pose Adjustment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00257v1)** | 2024-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collaborative autonomous driving with multiple vehicles usually requires the data fusion from multiple modalities. To ensure effective fusion, the data from each individual modality shall maintain a reasonably high quality. However, in collaborative perception, the quality of object detection based on a modality is highly sensitive to the relative pose errors among the agents. It leads to feature misalignment and significantly reduces collaborative performance. To address this issue, we propose RoCo, a novel unsupervised framework to conduct iterative object matching and agent pose adjustment. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to model the pose correction problem in collaborative perception as an object matching task, which reliably associates common objects detected by different agents. On top of this, we propose a graph optimization process to adjust the agent poses by minimizing the alignment errors of the associated objects, and the object matching is re-done based on the adjusted agent poses. This process is carried out iteratively until convergence. Experimental study on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrates that the proposed framework RoCo consistently outperforms existing relevant methods in terms of the collaborative object detection performance, and exhibits highly desired robustness when the pose information of agents is with high-level noise. Ablation studies are also provided to show the impact of its key parameters and components. The code is released at https://github.com/HuangZhe885/RoCo.</p></details> | ACM MM2024 |

However, commonly available prior maps are still tailored to control-and-decision tasks, and the use of these maps for localization remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose a lidar-based localization and mapping (LOAM) system that can exploit the common HD-maps in autonomous driving scenarios. Specifically, we propose a technique to extract information from the drivable area and ground surface height components of the HD-maps to construct 4DOF pose priors. These pose priors are then further integrated into the pose-graph optimization problem to create a globally consistent 3D map. Experiments show that our scheme can significantly improve the global consistency of the map compared to state-of-the-art lidar-only approaches, proven to be a useful technology to enhance the system's robustness, especially in GPS-denied environment. Moreover, our work also serves as a first step towards long-term navigation of robots in familiar environment, by updating a map. In autonomous driving this could enable updating the HD-maps without sourcing a new from a third party company, which is expensive and introduces delays from change in the world to updated map.</p></details> |  |

| **[Motif-Consistent Counterfactuals with Adversarial Refinement for Graph-Level Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13251v1)** | 2024-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-level anomaly detection is significant in diverse domains. To improve detection performance, counterfactual graphs have been exploited to benefit the generalization capacity by learning causal relations. Most existing studies directly introduce perturbations (e.g., flipping edges) to generate counterfactual graphs, which are prone to alter the semantics of generated examples and make them off the data manifold, resulting in sub-optimal performance. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach, Motif-consistent Counterfactuals with Adversarial Refinement (MotifCAR), for graph-level anomaly detection. The model combines the motif of one graph, the core subgraph containing the identification (category) information, and the contextual subgraph (non-motif) of another graph to produce a raw counterfactual graph. However, the produced raw graph might be distorted and cannot satisfy the important counterfactual properties: Realism, Validity, Proximity and Sparsity. Towards that, we present a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based graph optimizer to refine the raw counterfactual graphs. It adopts the discriminator to guide the generator to generate graphs close to realistic data, i.e., meet the property Realism. Further, we design the motif consistency to force the motif of the generated graphs to be consistent with the realistic graphs, meeting the property Validity. Also, we devise the contextual loss and connection loss to control the contextual subgraph and the newly added links to meet the properties Proximity and Sparsity. As a result, the model can generate high-quality counterfactual graphs. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of MotifCAR.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD 2024 |

Recently, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have emerged as a promising framework for 3D modeling. However, NeRFs require accurate camera poses as input, and existing methods struggle to handle significantly noisy pose estimates (i.e., outliers), which are commonly encountered in real-world scenarios. To tackle this challenge, we present a novel approach that optimizes radiance fields with scene graphs to mitigate the influence of outlier poses. Our method incorporates an adaptive inlier-outlier confidence estimation scheme based on scene graphs, emphasizing images of high compatibility with the neighborhood and consistency in the rendering quality. We also introduce an effective intersection-over-union (IoU) loss to optimize the camera pose and surface geometry, together with a coarse-to-fine strategy to facilitate the training. Furthermore, we propose a new dataset containing typical outlier poses for a detailed evaluation. Experimental results on various datasets consistently demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method over existing approaches, showcasing its robustness in handling outliers and producing high-quality 3D reconstructions.

| **[FE-GUT: Factor Graph Optimization hybrid with Extended Kalman Filter for tightly coupled GNSS/UWB Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06915v1)** | 2024-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Precise positioning and navigation information has been increasingly important with the development of the consumer electronics market. Due to some deficits of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), such as susceptible to interferences, integrating of GNSS with additional alternative sensors is a promising approach to overcome the performance limitations of GNSS-based localization systems. Ultra-Wideband (UWB) can be used to enhance GNSS in constructing an integrated localization system. However, most low-cost UWB devices lack a hardware-level time synchronization feature, which necessitates the estimation and compensation of the time-offset in the tightly coupled GNSS/UWB integration. Given the flexibility of probabilistic graphical models, the time-offset can be modeled as an invariant constant in the discretization of the continuous model. This work proposes a novel architecture in which Factor Graph Optimization (FGO) is hybrid with Extend Kalman Filter (EKF) for tightly coupled GNSS/UWB integration with online Temporal calibration (FE-GUT). FGO is utilized to precisely estimate the time-offset, while EKF provides initailization for the new factors and performs time-offset compensation. Simulation-based experiments validate the integrated localization performance of FE-GUT. In a four-wheeled robot scenario, the results demonstrate that, compared to EKF, FE-GUT can improve horizontal and vertical localization accuracy by 58.59\% and 34.80\%, respectively, while the time-offset estimation accuracy is improved by 76.80\%.

The proposed approach is based on a Voxel-TSDF representation used in recent algorithms. It introduces novel ways of integrating semantic prediction confidence during mapping, producing semantic and instance-consistent 3D regions. Further improvements are achieved by graph optimization-based semantic labeling and instance refinement. The proposed method achieves accuracy superior to the state of the art on public large-scale datasets, improving on a number of widely used metrics. We also highlight a downfall in the evaluation of recent studies: using the ground truth trajectory as input instead of a SLAM-estimated one substantially affects the accuracy, creating a large gap between the reported results and the actual performance on real-world data.</p></details> | 8 pages, 2 figures |

Graphon theory provides an approach to overcome these issues by defining limit objects for infinite sequences of graphs permitting one to approximate arbitrarily large networks by infinite dimensional operators. This is extended to stochastic systems by the use of Q-noise, a generalization of Wiener processes in finite dimensional spaces to processes in function spaces. The optimal control of linear quadratic problems on graphon systems with Q-noise disturbances are defined and shown to be the limit of the corresponding finite graph optimal control problem. The theory is extended to low rank systems, and a fully worked special case is presented. In addition, the worst-case long-range average and infinite horizon discounted optimal control performance with respect to Q-noise distribution are computed for a small set of standard graphon limits.</p></details> | 18 pages, 6 figures |

Such robots require SLAM algorithms suitable for specific applications and environments. Hence, several SLAM frameworks have been proposed to address various requirements in the past decade. However, we have encountered challenges in implementing recent innovative frameworks when handling service robots with low-end processors and insufficient sensor data, such as low-resolution 2D LiDAR sensors. Specifically, regarding commercial robots, consistent performance in different hardware configurations and environments is more crucial than the performance dedicated to specific sensors or environments. Therefore, we propose a) a multi-stage %hierarchical approach for global pose estimation in embedded systems; b) a graph generation method with zero constraints for synchronized sensors; and c) a robust and memory-efficient method for long-term pose-graph optimization. As verified in in-home and large-scale indoor environments, the proposed method yields consistent global pose estimation for services in commercial fields. Furthermore, the proposed method exhibits potential commercial viability considering the consistent performance verified via mass production and long-term (> 5 years) operation.</p></details> |  |

While open resources like OpenStreetMap (OSM) offer road networks with well-defined topology, they may not always be up to date worldwide. In this paper, we propose a fully automated pipeline for extracting road networks from very-high-resolution (VHR) satellite imagery. Our approach directly generates road line-strings that are seamlessly connected and precisely positioned. The process involves three key modules: a CNN-based neural network for road segmentation, a graph optimization algorithm to convert road predictions into vector line-strings, and a machine learning model for classifying road materials. Compared to OSM data, our results demonstrate significant potential for providing the latest road layouts and precise positions of road segments.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Unified Framework for Integer Programming Formulation of Graph Matching Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07666v1)** | 2024-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph theory has been a powerful tool in solving difficult and complex problems arising in all disciplines. In particular, graph matching is a classical problem in pattern analysis with enormous applications. Many graph problems have been formulated as a mathematical program and then solved using exact, heuristic, and/or approximated-guaranteed procedures. On the other hand, graph theory has been a powerful tool in visualizing and understanding complex mathematical programming problems, especially integer programs. Formulating a graph problem as a natural integer program (IP) is often a challenging task. However, an IP formulation of the problem has many advantages. Several researchers have noted the need for natural IP formulation of graph theoretic problems. The present study aims to provide a unified framework for IP formulation of graph-matching problems. Although there are many surveys on graph matching problems, none is concerned with IP formulation. This paper is the first to provide a comprehensive IP formulation for such problems. The framework includes a variety of graph optimization problems in the literature. While these problems have been studied by different research communities, however, the framework presented here helps to bring efforts from different disciplines to tackle such diverse and complex problems. We hope the present study can significantly help to simplify some of the difficult problems arising in practice, especially in pattern analysis.</p></details> | 34 pages |

We introduce various types of errors commonly encountered in SLAM, including reprojection error, photometric error, relative pose error, and line reprojection error, alongside their mathematical formulations. The fundamental role of error as the discrepancy between observed and predicted values in SLAM optimization is examined, emphasizing non-linear least squares methods for optimization. We provide a detailed analysis of: - Reprojection Error: Including Jacobian calculations for camera poses and map points, highlighting both theoretical underpinnings and practical consequences. - Photometric Error: Addressing errors from image intensity variations, essential for direct method-based SLAM. - Relative Pose Error: Discussing its significance in pose graph optimization, especially in loop closure scenarios. The paper also presents extensive derivations of Jacobian matrices for various SLAM components such as camera poses, map points, and motion parameters. We explore the application of Lie theory to optimize rotation representations and transformations, improving computational efficiency. Specific software implementations are referenced, offering practical insights into the real-world application of these theories in SLAM systems. Additionally, advanced topics such as line reprojection errors and IMU measurement errors are explored, discussing their impact on SLAM accuracy and performance. This comprehensive examination aims to enhance understanding and implementation of error analysis and Jacobian derivation in SLAM, contributing to more accurate and efficient state estimation in complex environments.</p></details> |  |

In response, we introduce Loopy-SLAM that globally optimizes poses and the dense 3D model. We use frame-to-model tracking using a data-driven point-based submap generation method and trigger loop closures online by performing global place recognition. Robust pose graph optimization is used to rigidly align the local submaps. As our representation is point based, map corrections can be performed efficiently without the need to store the entire history of input frames used for mapping as typically required by methods employing a grid based mapping structure. Evaluation on the synthetic Replica and real-world TUM-RGBD and ScanNet datasets demonstrate competitive or superior performance in tracking, mapping, and rendering accuracy when compared to existing dense neural RGBD SLAM methods.

| **[Fusing Structure from Motion and Simulation-Augmented Pose Regression from Optical Flow for Challenging Indoor Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07250v4)** | 2024-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The localization of objects is a crucial task in various applications such as robotics, virtual and augmented reality, and the transportation of goods in warehouses. Recent advances in deep learning have enabled the localization using monocular visual cameras. While structure from motion (SfM) predicts the absolute pose from a point cloud, absolute pose regression (APR) methods learn a semantic understanding of the environment through neural networks. However, both fields face challenges caused by the environment such as motion blur, lighting changes, repetitive patterns, and feature-less structures. This study aims to address these challenges by incorporating additional information and regularizing the absolute pose using relative pose regression (RPR) methods. RPR methods suffer under different challenges, i.e., motion blur. The optical flow between consecutive images is computed using the Lucas-Kanade algorithm, and the relative pose is predicted using an auxiliary small recurrent convolutional network. The fusion of absolute and relative poses is a complex task due to the mismatch between the global and local coordinate systems. State-of-the-art methods fusing absolute and relative poses use pose graph optimization (PGO) to regularize the absolute pose predictions using relative poses. In this work, we propose recurrent fusion networks to optimally align absolute and relative pose predictions to improve the absolute pose prediction. We evaluate eight different recurrent units and construct a simulation environment to pre-train the APR and RPR networks for better generalized training. Additionally, we record a large database of different scenarios in a challenging large-scale indoor environment that mimics a warehouse with transportation robots. We conduct hyperparameter searches and experiments to show the effectiveness of our recurrent fusion method compared to PGO.</p></details> |  |

Optimal graph filters rely on Laplacian eigendecomposition for Fourier transform. In an attempt to avert prohibitive computations, numerous polynomial filters have been proposed. However, polynomials in the majority of these filters are predefined and remain fixed across different graphs, failing to accommodate the varying degrees of heterophily. Addressing this gap, we demystify the intrinsic correlation between the spectral property of desired polynomial bases and the heterophily degrees via thorough theoretical analyses. Subsequently, we develop a novel adaptive heterophily basis wherein the basis vectors mutually form angles reflecting the heterophily degree of the graph. We integrate this heterophily basis with the homophily basis to construct a universal polynomial basis UniBasis, which devises a polynomial filter based graph neural network - UniFilter. It optimizes the convolution and propagation in GNN, thus effectively limiting over-smoothing and alleviating over-squashing. Our extensive experiments, conducted on a diverse range of real-world and synthetic datasets with varying degrees of heterophily, support the superiority of UniFilter. These results not only demonstrate the universality of UniBasis but also highlight its proficiency in graph explanation.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2311.18177</p></details> |

Prior kinematic motion model-based IO methods often use a simplified linearized IMU noise model and thus usually encounter difficulties in modeling non-deterministic errors arising from environmental disturbances and mechanical defects. In contrast, data-driven IO methods struggle to accurately model the sensor motions, often leading to generalizability and interoperability issues. To address these challenges, we present AirIMU, a hybrid approach to estimate the uncertainty, especially the non-deterministic errors, by data-driven methods and increase the generalization abilities using model-based methods. We demonstrate the adaptability of AirIMU using a full spectrum of IMUs, from low-cost automotive grades to high-end navigation grades. We also validate its effectiveness on various platforms, including hand-held devices, vehicles, and a helicopter that covers a trajectory of 262 kilometers. In the ablation study, we validate the effectiveness of our learned uncertainty in an IMU-GPS pose graph optimization experiment, achieving a 31.6\% improvement in accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that jointly training the IMU noise correction and uncertainty estimation synergistically benefits both tasks.</p></details> |  |

Solutions such as pre-training and domain-specific fine-tuning add substantial computational overhead, requiring further domain expertise. Here, we introduce a token-optimized and robust Knowledge Graph-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (KG-RAG) framework by leveraging a massive biomedical KG (SPOKE) with LLMs such as Llama-2-13b, GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4, to generate meaningful biomedical text rooted in established knowledge. Compared to the existing RAG technique for Knowledge Graphs, the proposed method utilizes minimal graph schema for context extraction and uses embedding methods for context pruning. This optimization in context extraction results in more than 50% reduction in token consumption without compromising the accuracy, making a cost-effective and robust RAG implementation on proprietary LLMs. KG-RAG consistently enhanced the performance of LLMs across diverse biomedical prompts by generating responses rooted in established knowledge, accompanied by accurate provenance and statistical evidence (if available) to substantiate the claims. Further benchmarking on human curated datasets, such as biomedical true/false and multiple-choice questions (MCQ), showed a remarkable 71% boost in the performance of the Llama-2 model on the challenging MCQ dataset, demonstrating the framework's capacity to empower open-source models with fewer parameters for domain specific questions. Furthermore, KG-RAG enhanced the performance of proprietary GPT models, such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. In summary, the proposed framework combines explicit and implicit knowledge of KG and LLM in a token optimized fashion, thus enhancing the adaptability of general-purpose LLMs to tackle domain-specific questions in a cost-effective fashion.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 5 figures, 1 table, 1 supplementary file</p></details> |

Previous studies have demonstrated that, while incorporating guidance, such as highways, can accelerate MAPF algorithms, this often results in a trade-off with solution quality. In addition, how to generate good guidance automatically remains largely unexplored, with current methods falling short of surpassing manually designed ones. In this work, we introduce the guidance graph as a versatile representation of guidance for lifelong MAPF, framing Guidance Graph Optimization as the task of optimizing its edge weights.

However, most existing HGNNs rely on spatial domain-based methods to aggregate information, i.e., manually selected meta-paths or some heuristic modules, lacking theoretical guarantees. Furthermore, these methods cannot learn arbitrary valid heterogeneous graph filters within the spectral domain, which have limited expressiveness. To tackle these issues, we present a positive spectral heterogeneous graph convolution via positive noncommutative polynomials. Then, using this convolution, we propose PSHGCN, a novel Positive Spectral Heterogeneous Graph Convolutional Network. PSHGCN offers a simple yet effective method for learning valid heterogeneous graph filters. Moreover, we demonstrate the rationale of PSHGCN in the graph optimization framework. We conducted an extensive experimental study to show that PSHGCN can learn diverse heterogeneous graph filters and outperform all baselines on open benchmarks.

However, its performance under varying network setups, especially when combined with IMU data for real-time localization, has not been fully explored so far. In this study, we develop an error state Kalman filter (ESKF) and a pose graph optimization (PGO) approach to address this gap. We systematically evaluate the performance of the derived approaches for real-time MAV localization in realistic scenarios with 5G base stations in Line-Of-Sight (LOS), demonstrating the potential of 5G technologies in this domain. In order to experimentally test and compare our localization approaches, we augment the EuRoC MAV benchmark dataset for visual-inertial odometry with simulated yet highly realistic 5G ToA measurements. Our experimental results comprehensively assess the impact of varying network setups, including varying base station numbers and network configurations, on ToA-based MAV localization performance. The findings show promising results for seamless and robust localization using 5G ToA measurements, achieving an accuracy of 15 cm throughout the entire trajectory within a graph-based framework with five 5G base stations, and an accuracy of up to 34 cm in the case of ESKF-based localization. Additionally, we measure the run time of both algorithms and show that they are both fast enough for real-time implementation.</p></details> |  |

In VLP systems that use Photodiodes (PDs) as light receivers, the Received Signal Strength (RSS) is affected by the incidence angle of light, making the inclination of PDs a critical parameter in the positioning model. Currently, most studies assume the inclination to be constant, limiting the applications and positioning accuracy. Additionally, light blockages may severely interfere with the RSS measurements but the literature has not explored blockage detection in real-world experiments. To address these problems, we propose a tightly coupled VLP/INS (Inertial Navigation System) integrated navigation system that uses graph optimization to account for varying PD inclinations and VLP blockages. We also discussed the possibility of simultaneously estimating the robot's pose and the locations of some unknown LEDs. Simulations and two groups of real-world experiments demonstrate the efficiency of our approach, achieving an average positioning accuracy of 10 cm during movement and inclination accuracy within 1 degree despite inclination changes and blockages.</p></details> |  |

Development of new DL models typically involves two parties: the model developers and performance optimizers. The collaboration between the parties often necessitates the model developers exposing the model architecture and computational graph to the optimizers. However, this exposure is undesirable since the model architecture is an important intellectual property, and its innovations require significant investments and expertise. During the exchange, the model is also vulnerable to adversarial attacks via model stealing. This paper presents Proteus, a novel mechanism that enables model optimization by an independent party while preserving the confidentiality of the model architecture. Proteus obfuscates the protected model by partitioning its computational graph into subgraphs and concealing each subgraph within a large pool of generated realistic subgraphs that cannot be easily distinguished from the original. We evaluate Proteus on a range of DNNs, demonstrating its efficacy in preserving confidentiality without compromising performance optimization opportunities. Proteus effectively hides the model as one alternative among up to $10^{32}$ possible model architectures, and is resilient against attacks with a learning-based adversary. We also demonstrate that heuristic based and manual approaches are ineffective in identifying the protected model. To our knowledge, Proteus is the first work that tackles the challenge of model confidentiality during performance optimization. Proteus will be open-sourced for direct use and experimentation, with easy integration with compilers such as ONNXRuntime.</p></details> |  |

However, in real-world environments with dynamic objects, existing 3DGS-based SLAM systems often face mapping errors and tracking drift issues. To address these problems, we propose GARAD-SLAM, a real-time 3DGS-based SLAM system tailored for dynamic scenes. In terms of tracking, unlike traditional methods, we directly perform dynamic segmentation on Gaussians and map them back to the front-end to obtain dynamic point labels through a Gaussian pyramid network, achieving precise dynamic removal and robust tracking. For mapping, we impose rendering penalties on dynamically labeled Gaussians, which are updated through the network, to avoid irreversible erroneous removal caused by simple pruning. Our results on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method is competitive in tracking compared to baseline methods, generating fewer artifacts and higher-quality reconstructions in rendering.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper was accepted by ICRA 2025</p></details> |

Although effective for accurate visual odometry in complex scenarios, these methods discard crucial information about moving objects. By incorporating this information into a Dynamic SLAM framework, the motion of dynamic entities can be estimated, enhancing navigation whilst ensuring accurate localization. However, the fundamental formulation of Dynamic SLAM remains an open challenge, with no consensus on the optimal approach for accurate motion estimation within a SLAM pipeline. Therefore, we developed DynoSAM, an open-source framework for Dynamic SLAM that enables the efficient implementation, testing, and comparison of various Dynamic SLAM optimization formulations. DynoSAM integrates static and dynamic measurements into a unified optimization problem solved using factor graphs, simultaneously estimating camera poses, static scene, object motion or poses, and object structures. We evaluate DynoSAM across diverse simulated and real-world datasets, achieving state-of-the-art motion estimation in indoor and outdoor environments, with substantial improvements over existing systems. Additionally, we demonstrate DynoSAM utility in downstream applications, including 3D reconstruction of dynamic scenes and trajectory prediction, thereby showcasing potential for advancing dynamic object-aware SLAM systems. DynoSAM is open-sourced at https://github.com/ACFR-RPG/DynOSAM.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 10 figures. Submitted to T-RO Visual SLAM SI 2025</p></details> |
| **[TivNe-SLAM: Dynamic Mapping and Tracking via Time-Varying Neural Radiance Fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18917v7)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Previous attempts to integrate Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) into the Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) framework either rely on the assumption of static scenes or require the ground truth camera poses, which impedes their application in real-world scenarios. This paper proposes a time-varying representation to track and reconstruct the dynamic scenes. Firstly, two processes, a tracking process and a mapping process, are maintained simultaneously in our framework. In the tracking process, all input images are uniformly sampled and then progressively trained in a self-supervised paradigm. In the mapping process, we leverage motion masks to distinguish dynamic objects from the static background, and sample more pixels from dynamic areas. Secondly, the parameter optimization for both processes is comprised of two stages: the first stage associates time with 3D positions to convert the deformation field to the canonical field. The second stage associates time with the embeddings of the canonical field to obtain colors and a Signed Distance Function (SDF). Lastly, we propose a novel keyframe selection strategy based on the overlapping rate. Our approach is evaluated on two synthetic datasets and one real-world dataset, and the experiments validate that our method achieves competitive results in both tracking and mapping when compared to existing state-of-the-art NeRF-based dynamic SLAM systems.</p></details> |  |

While recent advancements in dense SLAM have leveraged Gaussian Splatting to enhance scene representation, most approaches assume a static environment, making them vulnerable to photometric and geometric inconsistencies caused by dynamic objects. To address these challenges, we integrate Gaussian Splatting SLAM with a robust filtering process to handle dynamic objects throughout the entire pipeline, including Gaussian insertion and keyframe selection. Within this framework, to further improve the accuracy of dynamic object removal, we introduce a robust mask generation method that enforces photometric consistency across keyframes, reducing noise from inaccurate segmentation and artifacts such as shadows. Additionally, we propose the loop-aware window selection mechanism, which utilizes unique keyframe IDs of 3D Gaussians to detect loops between the current and past frames, facilitating joint optimization of the current camera poses and the Gaussian map. DGS-SLAM achieves state-of-the-art performance in both camera tracking and novel view synthesis on various dynamic SLAM benchmarks, proving its effectiveness in handling real-world dynamic scenes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, Under review</p></details> |

However, their performance significantly deteriorates when deployed in settings with a higher presence of movable objects, such as environments with pedestrians, cars, and buses, which are common in outdoor scenes. To address this issue, we propose a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)-based real-time stereo SLAM system that leverages complete geometry information to avoid information loss. Moreover, there is currently no publicly available dataset for directly evaluating the effectiveness of dynamic and static feature classification methods, and to bridge this gap, we have created a publicly available dataset containing over 50,000 feature points. Experimental results demonstrate that our MLP-based dynamic and static feature point discriminator has achieved superior performance compared to other methods on this dataset. Furthermore, the MLP-based real-time stereo SLAM system has shown the highest average precision and fastest speed on the outdoor KITTI tracking datasets compared to other dynamic SLAM systems.The open-source code and datasets are available at https://github.com/TaozheLi/MLP-SLAM.</p></details> | Dynamic SLAM |

To enable robots to safely navigate and plan in dynamic environments, it is essential to employ representations capable of handling moving objects. Dynamic SLAM is an emerging field in SLAM research as it improves the overall system accuracy while providing additional estimation of object motions. State-of-the-art literature informs two main formulations for Dynamic SLAM, representing dynamic object points in either the world or object coordinate frame. While expressing object points in a local reference frame may seem intuitive, it may not necessarily lead to the most accurate and robust solutions. This paper conducts and presents a thorough analysis of various Dynamic SLAM formulations, identifying the best approach to address the problem. To this end, we introduce a front-end agnostic framework using GTSAM that can be used to evaluate various Dynamic SLAM formulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, accepted by ICRA 2024</p></details> |

However, they usually require GPUs to operate in real-time. Therefore, this paper proposes an open-source real-time dynamic SLAM system that runs solely on CPU by incorporating a mask prediction mechanism, which allows the deep learning method and the camera tracking to run entirely in parallel at different frequencies. Our SLAM system further introduces a dual-stage optical flow tracking approach and employs a hybrid usage of optical flow and ORB features, enhancing efficiency and robustness by selectively allocating computational resources to input frames. Compared with previous methods, our system maintains high localization accuracy in dynamic environments while achieving a tracking frame rate of 56 FPS on a laptop CPU, proving that deep learning methods are feasible for dynamic SLAM without GPU support. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first SLAM system to achieve this.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |

| **[Learn to Memorize and to Forget: A Continual Learning Perspective of Dynamic SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13338v1)** | 2024-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) with implicit neural representations has received extensive attention due to the expressive representation power and the innovative paradigm of continual learning. However, deploying such a system within a dynamic environment has not been well-studied. Such challenges are intractable even for conventional algorithms since observations from different views with dynamic objects involved break the geometric and photometric consistency, whereas the consistency lays the foundation for joint optimizing the camera pose and the map parameters. In this paper, we best exploit the characteristics of continual learning and propose a novel SLAM framework for dynamic environments. While past efforts have been made to avoid catastrophic forgetting by exploiting an experience replay strategy, we view forgetting as a desirable characteristic. By adaptively controlling the replayed buffer, the ambiguity caused by moving objects can be easily alleviated through forgetting. We restrain the replay of the dynamic objects by introducing a continually-learned classifier for dynamic object identification. The iterative optimization of the neural map and the classifier notably improves the robustness of the SLAM system under a dynamic environment. Experiments on challenging datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

However, this approach relies on a static environment assumption and does not work robustly within a dynamic environment due to the inconsistent observation of geometry and photometry. To address the challenges presented in dynamic environments, we propose a novel dynamic SLAM framework with neural radiance field. Specifically, we introduce a motion mask generation method to filter out the invalid sampled rays. This design effectively fuses the optical flow mask and semantic mask to enhance the precision of motion mask. To further improve the accuracy of pose estimation, we have designed a divide-and-conquer pose optimization algorithm that distinguishes between keyframes and non-keyframes. The proposed edge warp loss can effectively enhance the geometry constraints between adjacent frames. Extensive experiments are conducted on the two challenging datasets, and the results show that RoDyn-SLAM achieves state-of-the-art performance among recent neural RGB-D methods in both accuracy and robustness.</p></details> | IEEE RAL 2024 |

While large strides have been made towards developing dynamic SLAM approaches that estimate the robot pose accurately, a lesser emphasis has been put on the construction of dense spatio-temporal representations of the robot environment. A detailed understanding of the scene and its evolution through time is crucial for long-term robot autonomy and essential to tasks that require long-term reasoning, such as operating effectively in environments shared with humans and other agents and thus are subject to short and long-term dynamics. To address this challenge, this work defines the Spatio-temporal Metric-semantic SLAM (SMS) problem, and presents a framework to factorize and solve it efficiently. We show that the proposed factorization suggests a natural organization of a spatio-temporal perception system, where a fast process tracks short-term dynamics in an active temporal window, while a slower process reasons over long-term changes in the environment using a factor graph formulation. We provide an efficient implementation of the proposed spatio-temporal perception approach, that we call Khronos, and show that it unifies exiting interpretations of short-term and long-term dynamics and is able to construct a dense spatio-temporal map in real-time. We provide simulated and real results, showing that the spatio-temporal maps built by Khronos are an accurate reflection of a 3D scene over time and that Khronos outperforms baselines across multiple metrics. We further validate our approach on two heterogeneous robots in challenging, large-scale real-world environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Robotics: Science and Systems, 2024.

This paper develops a real-time multi-object tracking and prediction system in rugged environments. A 3D object detection algorithm based on Lidar-camera fusion is designed to detect the target objects. Based on the Hungarian algorithm, this paper designs a 3D multi-object tracking algorithm with an adaptive threshold to realize the stable matching and tracking of the objects. We combine Memory Augmented Neural Networks (MANN) and Kalman filter to achieve 3D trajectory prediction on rugged terrains. Besides, we realize a new dynamic SLAM by using the results of multi-object tracking to remove dynamic points for better SLAM performance and static map. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed multi-object tracking and prediction system, several simulations and physical experiments are conducted. The results show that the proposed system can track dynamic objects and provide future trajectory and a more clean static map in real-time.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 Pag...</summary><p>6 Pages, 8 figures, submitted to ROBIO2023</p></details> |
| **[Simulation of Dynamic Environments for SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04286v2)** | 2023-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulation engines are widely adopted in robotics. However, they lack either full simulation control, ROS integration, realistic physics, or photorealism. Recently, synthetic data generation and realistic rendering has advanced tasks like target tracking and human pose estimation. However, when focusing on vision applications, there is usually a lack of information like sensor measurements or time continuity. On the other hand, simulations for most robotics tasks are performed in (semi)static environments, with specific sensors and low visual fidelity. To solve this, we introduced in our previous work a fully customizable framework for generating realistic animated dynamic environments (GRADE) [1]. We use GRADE to generate an indoor dynamic environment dataset and then compare multiple SLAM algorithms on different sequences. By doing that, we show how current research over-relies on known benchmarks, failing to generalize. Our tests with refined YOLO and Mask R-CNN models provide further evidence that additional research in dynamic SLAM is necessary.

| **[RGB-D-Inertial SLAM in Indoor Dynamic Environments with Long-term Large Occlusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13316v1)** | 2023-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work presents a novel RGB-D-inertial dynamic SLAM method that can enable accurate localisation when the majority of the camera view is occluded by multiple dynamic objects over a long period of time. Most dynamic SLAM approaches either remove dynamic objects as outliers when they account for a minor proportion of the visual input, or detect dynamic objects using semantic segmentation before camera tracking. Therefore, dynamic objects that cause large occlusions are difficult to detect without prior information. The remaining visual information from the static background is also not enough to support localisation when large occlusion lasts for a long period. To overcome these problems, our framework presents a robust visual-inertial bundle adjustment that simultaneously tracks camera, estimates cluster-wise dense segmentation of dynamic objects and maintains a static sparse map by combining dense and sparse features. The experiment results demonstrate that our method achieves promising localisation and object segmentation performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods in the scenario of long-term large occlusion.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |

Recent SLAM frameworks have been proposed to simultaneously track the camera and moving objects. However they are often unable to estimate the canonical pose of the objects and exhibit a low object tracking accuracy. To solve this problem we propose TwistSLAM++, a semantic, dynamic, SLAM system that fuses stereo images and LiDAR information. Using semantic information, we track potentially moving objects and associate them to 3D object detections in LiDAR scans to obtain their pose and size. Then, we perform registration on consecutive object scans to refine object pose estimation. Finally, object scans are used to estimate the shape of the object and constrain map points to lie on the estimated surface within the BA. We show on classical benchmarks that this fusion approach based on multimodal information improves the accuracy of object tracking.</p></details> |  |

Many of these applications require autonomous agents to perform SLAM in highly dynamic scenes. To this end, this tutorial extends a recently introduced, unifying optimization-based SLAM backend framework to environments with moving objects and features. Using this framework, we consider a rapprochement of recent advances in dynamic SLAM. Moreover, we present dynamic EKF SLAM: a novel, filtering-based dynamic SLAM algorithm generated from our framework, and prove that it is mathematically equivalent to a direct extension of the classical EKF SLAM algorithm to the dynamic environment setting. Empirical results with simulated data indicate that dynamic EKF SLAM can achieve high localization and mobile object pose estimation accuracy, as well as high map precision, with high efficiency.</p></details> |  |

While learning-based dynamic SLAM systems have difficulties in handling unknown moving objects, geometry-based methods have limited success in addressing the residual effects of unidentified dynamic objects on location estimation. To address these issues, we propose an anti-dynamics two-stage SLAM approach. Firstly, the potential motion regions of both prior and non-prior dynamic objects are extracted and pose estimates for dynamic discrimination are quickly obtained using optical flow tracking and model generation methods. Secondly, dynamic points in each frame are removed through dynamic judgment. For non-prior dynamic objects, we present a approach that uses super-pixel extraction and geometric clustering to determine the potential motion regions based on color and geometric information in the image. Evaluations on multiple low and high dynamic sequences in a public RGB-D dataset show that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art dynamic SLAM methods.</p></details> |  |

Previous dynamic SLAM methods either rely on semantic segmentation to directly detect dynamic objects; or assume that dynamic objects occupy a smaller proportion of the camera view than the static background and can, therefore, be removed as outliers. Our approach, however, enables dense SLAM when the camera view is largely occluded by multiple dynamic objects with the aid of camera motion prior. The dynamic planar objects are separated by their different rigid motions and tracked independently. The remaining dynamic non-planar areas are removed as outliers and not mapped into the background. The evaluation demonstrates that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of localisation, mapping, dynamic segmentation and object tracking. We also demonstrate its robustness to large drift in the camera motion prior.</p></details> | 8 papges, 9 figures |

Dynamic 3D object tracking has then become a significant capability in visual SLAM with the requirement of understanding dynamic surroundings in various scenarios including autonomous driving, augmented and virtual reality. However, performing dynamic SLAM solely with monocular images remains a challenging problem due to the difficulty of associating dynamic features and estimating their positions. In this paper, we present MOTSLAM, a dynamic visual SLAM system with the monocular configuration that tracks both poses and bounding boxes of dynamic objects. MOTSLAM first performs multiple object tracking (MOT) with associated both 2D and 3D bounding box detection to create initial 3D objects. Then, neural-network-based monocular depth estimation is applied to fetch the depth of dynamic features. Finally, camera poses, object poses, and both static, as well as dynamic map points, are jointly optimized using a novel bundle adjustment. Our experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that our system has reached best performance on both camera ego-motion and object tracking on monocular dynamic SLAM.</p></details> |  |

Several SLAM systems with impressive performance have been invented and used during the last several decades. However, there are still unresolved issues, such as how to deal with moving objects in dynamic situations. Classic SLAM systems depend on the assumption of a static environment, which becomes unworkable in highly dynamic situations. Several methods have been presented to tackle this issue in recent years, but each has its limitations. This research combines the visual SLAM systems ORB-SLAM3 and Detectron2 to present the Det-SLAM system, which employs depth information and semantic segmentation to identify and eradicate dynamic spots to accomplish semantic SLAM for dynamic situations. Evaluation of public TUM datasets indicates that Det-SLAM is more resilient than previous dynamic SLAM systems and can lower the estimated error of camera posture in dynamic indoor scenarios.</p></details> | 5 pages, 2 figures |

Existing methods mainly focus on identifying and excluding dynamic objects from the optimization. In this paper, we show that feature-based visual SLAM systems can also benefit from the presence of dynamic articulated objects by taking advantage of two observations: (1) The 3D structure of each rigid part of articulated object remains consistent over time; (2) The points on the same rigid part follow the same motion. In particular, we present AirDOS, a dynamic object-aware system that introduces rigidity and motion constraints to model articulated objects. By jointly optimizing the camera pose, object motion, and the object 3D structure, we can rectify the camera pose estimation, preventing tracking loss, and generate 4D spatio-temporal maps for both dynamic objects and static scenes. Experiments show that our algorithm improves the robustness of visual SLAM algorithms in challenging crowded urban environments. To the best of our knowledge, AirDOS is the first dynamic object-aware SLAM system demonstrating that camera pose estimation can be improved by incorporating dynamic articulated objects.</p></details> |  |

The paper proposes a dynamic SLAM framework RF-LIO, building on LIO-SAM, which adds adaptive multi-resolution range images and uses tightly-coupled lidar inertial odometry to first remove moving objects, and then match lidar scan to the submap. Thus, it can obtain accurate poses even in high dynamic environments. The proposed RF-LIO is evaluated on both self-collected datasets and open Urbanloco datasets. The experimental results in high dynamic environments demonstrate that, compared with LOAM and LIO-SAM, the absolute trajectory accuracy of the proposed RF-LIO can be improved by 90% and 70%, respectively. RF-LIO is one of the state-of-the-art SLAM systems in high dynamic environments.</p></details> |  |

Currently, several approaches achieve the avoidance of static obstacles based on the mapping of indoor scenes. To solve the issue of distinguishing dynamic obstacles, we propose an assistive system with an RGB-D sensor to detect dynamic information of a scene. Once the system captures an image, panoptic segmentation is performed to obtain the prior dynamic object information. With sparse feature points extracted from images and the depth information, poses of the user can be estimated. After the ego-motion estimation, the dynamic object can be identified and tracked. Then, poses and speed of tracked dynamic objects can be estimated, which are passed to the users through acoustic feedback.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCHP 2022</p></details> |

Recently, some related works generally use the combination of semantic constraints and geometric constraints to deal with dynamic objects, but problems can still be raised, such as poor real-time performance, easy to treat people as rigid bodies, and poor performance in low dynamic scenes. In this paper, a dynamic scene-oriented visual SLAM algorithm based on object detection and coarse-to-fine static probability named CFP-SLAM is proposed. The algorithm combines semantic constraints and geometric constraints to calculate the static probability of objects, keypoints and map points, and takes them as weights to participate in camera pose estimation. Extensive evaluations show that our approach can achieve almost the best results in high dynamic and low dynamic scenarios compared to the state-of-the-art dynamic SLAM methods, and shows quite high real-time ability.</p></details> |  |

The motion of rigid objects can be typically tracked by exploiting their texture and geometric features. However, humans moving in the scene are often one of the most important, interactive targets - they are very hard to track and reconstruct robustly due to non-rigid shapes. In this work, we present a fast, learning-based human object detector to isolate the dynamic human objects and realise a real-time dense background reconstruction framework. We go further by estimating and reconstructing the human pose and shape. The final output environment maps not only provide the dense static backgrounds but also contain the dynamic human meshes and their trajectories. Our Dynamic SLAM system runs at around 26 frames per second (fps) on GPUs, while additionally turning on accurate human pose estimation can be executed at up to 10 fps.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IROS-2021</p></details> |

Most prior efforts, however, often assume that the target object's CAD model, at least at a category-level, is available for offline training or during online template matching. This work proposes BundleTrack, a general framework for 6D pose tracking of novel objects, which does not depend upon 3D models, either at the instance or category-level. It leverages the complementary attributes of recent advances in deep learning for segmentation and robust feature extraction, as well as memory-augmented pose graph optimization for spatiotemporal consistency. This enables long-term, low-drift tracking under various challenging scenarios, including significant occlusions and object motions. Comprehensive experiments given two public benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-art, category-level 6D tracking or dynamic SLAM methods. When compared against state-of-art methods that rely on an object instance CAD model, comparable performance is achieved, despite the proposed method's reduced information requirements. An efficient implementation in CUDA provides a real-time performance of 10Hz for the entire framework. Code is available at: https://github.com/wenbowen123/BundleTrack</p></details> |  |

Based on the estimated camera pose and object poses, we associate segmented masks with existing models and incrementally fuse corresponding colour, depth, semantic, and foreground object probabilities into each object model. In contrast to existing approaches, our system is the first system to generate an object-level dynamic volumetric map from a single RGB-D camera, which can be used directly for robotic tasks.

Semantic SLAM, an online approach, integrates pose tracking, geometric reconstruction, and semantic mapping into a unified framework, shows significant potential. However, existing systems, which rely on 2D ground truth priors for supervision, are often limited by the sparsity and noise of these signals in real-world environments. To address this challenge, we propose GSFF-SLAM, a novel dense semantic SLAM system based on 3D Gaussian Splatting that leverages feature fields to achieve joint rendering of appearance, geometry, and N-dimensional semantic features. By independently optimizing feature gradients, our method supports semantic reconstruction using various forms of 2D priors, particularly sparse and noisy signals. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous methods in both tracking accuracy and photorealistic rendering quality. When utilizing 2D ground truth priors, GSFF-SLAM achieves state-of-the-art semantic segmentation performance with 95.03\% mIoU, while achieving up to 2.9$\times$ speedup with only marginal performance degradation.</p></details> |  |

We present a novel semantic SLAM approach that leverages road elements such as lane boundaries, traffic signs, and road markings to enhance localization accuracy. Our system integrates real-time semantic feature detection with a graph optimization framework, effectively handling both rolling-shutter effects and INS drift. Using a practical hardware setup which consists of a rolling-shutter camera (3840*2160@30fps), IMU (100Hz), and wheel encoder (50Hz), we demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods. Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, our method achieves higher recall (up to 5.35\%) and precision (up to 2.79\%) in semantic element detection, while maintaining mean relative error (MRE) within 10cm and mean absolute error (MAE) around 1m. Extensive experiments in diverse urban environments demonstrate the robust performance of our system under varying lighting conditions and complex traffic scenarios, making it particularly suitable for autonomous driving applications. The proposed approach provides a practical solution for high-precision localization using affordable hardware, bridging the gap between consumer-grade sensors and production-level performance requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE IV'25</p></details> |

However, existing Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) methods generally focus on either geometric or semantic reconstruction. In this paper, we introduce PanoSLAM, the first SLAM system to integrate geometric reconstruction, 3D semantic segmentation, and 3D instance segmentation within a unified framework. Our approach builds upon 3D Gaussian Splatting, modified with several critical components to enable efficient rendering of depth, color, semantic, and instance information from arbitrary viewpoints. To achieve panoptic 3D scene reconstruction from sequential RGB-D videos, we propose an online Spatial-Temporal Lifting (STL) module that transfers 2D panoptic predictions from vision models into 3D Gaussian representations. This STL module addresses the challenges of label noise and inconsistencies in 2D predictions by refining the pseudo labels across multi-view inputs, creating a coherent 3D representation that enhances segmentation accuracy. Our experiments show that PanoSLAM outperforms recent semantic SLAM methods in both mapping and tracking accuracy. For the first time, it achieves panoptic 3D reconstruction of open-world environments directly from the RGB-D video. (https://github.com/runnanchen/PanoSLAM)</p></details> |  |

This paper presents an object-based semantic SLAM method for underwater environments that can identify, localize, classify, and map a wide variety of marine objects without a priori knowledge of the object classes present in the scene.

A robot's exploration behavior can be inherently affected by the performance of its Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) subsystem, although SLAM and exploration are generally studied separately. In this paper, we formulate exploration as an active mapping problem and extend it with semantic information. We introduce a novel active metric-semantic SLAM approach, leveraging recent research advances in information theory and spectral graph theory: we combine semantic mutual information and the connectivity metrics of the underlying pose graph of the SLAM subsystem. We use the resulting utility function to evaluate different trajectories to select the most favorable strategy during exploration. Exploration and SLAM metrics are analyzed in experiments. Running our algorithm on the Habitat dataset, we show that, while maintaining efficiency close to the state-of-the-art exploration methods, our approach effectively increases the performance of metric-semantic SLAM with a 21% reduction in average map error and a 9% improvement in average semantic classification accuracy.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

Commonly, 3D semantic reconstruction systems capture the entire scene in the same level of detail. However, certain tasks (e.g., object interaction) require a fine-grained and high-resolution map, particularly if the objects to interact are of small size or intricate geometry. In recent practice, this leads to the entire map being in the same high-quality resolution, which results in increased computational and storage costs. To address this challenge, we propose MAP-ADAPT, a real-time method for quality-adaptive semantic 3D reconstruction using RGBD frames. MAP-ADAPT is the first adaptive semantic 3D mapping algorithm that, unlike prior work, generates directly a single map with regions of different quality based on both the semantic information and the geometric complexity of the scene. Leveraging a semantic SLAM pipeline for pose and semantic estimation, we achieve comparable or superior results to state-of-the-art methods on synthetic and real-world data, while significantly reducing storage and computation requirements.</p></details> |  |

In this system, we incorporate semantic feature embedding into 3D Gaussian representation, which effectively encodes semantic information within the spatial layout of the environment for precise semantic scene representation. Furthermore, we propose feature-level loss for updating 3D Gaussian representation, enabling higher-level guidance for 3D Gaussian optimization. In addition, to reduce cumulative drift in tracking and improve semantic reconstruction accuracy, we introduce semantic-informed bundle adjustment leveraging multi-frame semantic associations for joint optimization of 3D Gaussian representation and camera poses, leading to low-drift tracking and accurate mapping. Our SemGauss-SLAM method demonstrates superior performance over existing radiance field-based SLAM methods in terms of mapping and tracking accuracy on Replica and ScanNet datasets, while also showing excellent capabilities in high-precision semantic segmentation and dense semantic mapping.</p></details> |  |

While large strides have been made towards developing dynamic SLAM approaches that estimate the robot pose accurately, a lesser emphasis has been put on the construction of dense spatio-temporal representations of the robot environment. A detailed understanding of the scene and its evolution through time is crucial for long-term robot autonomy and essential to tasks that require long-term reasoning, such as operating effectively in environments shared with humans and other agents and thus are subject to short and long-term dynamics. To address this challenge, this work defines the Spatio-temporal Metric-semantic SLAM (SMS) problem, and presents a framework to factorize and solve it efficiently. We show that the proposed factorization suggests a natural organization of a spatio-temporal perception system, where a fast process tracks short-term dynamics in an active temporal window, while a slower process reasons over long-term changes in the environment using a factor graph formulation. We provide an efficient implementation of the proposed spatio-temporal perception approach, that we call Khronos, and show that it unifies exiting interpretations of short-term and long-term dynamics and is able to construct a dense spatio-temporal map in real-time. We provide simulated and real results, showing that the spatio-temporal maps built by Khronos are an accurate reflection of a 3D scene over time and that Khronos outperforms baselines across multiple metrics. We further validate our approach on two heterogeneous robots in challenging, large-scale real-world environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Robotics: Science and Systems, 2024.

In this system, we introduce hierarchical semantic representation to allow multi-level semantic comprehension for top-down structured semantic mapping of the scene. In addition, to fully utilize the correlation between multiple attributes of the environment, we integrate appearance, geometry and semantic features through cross-attention for feature collaboration. This strategy enables a more multifaceted understanding of the environment, thereby allowing SNI-SLAM to remain robust even when single attribute is defective. Then, we design an internal fusion-based decoder to obtain semantic, RGB, Truncated Signed Distance Field (TSDF) values from multi-level features for accurate decoding. Furthermore, we propose a feature loss to update the scene representation at the feature level. Compared with low-level losses such as RGB loss and depth loss, our feature loss is capable of guiding the network optimization on a higher-level. Our SNI-SLAM method demonstrates superior performance over all recent NeRF-based SLAM methods in terms of mapping and tracking accuracy on Replica and ScanNet datasets, while also showing excellent capabilities in accurate semantic segmentation and real-time semantic mapping.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2024</p></details> |
| **[SD-SLAM: A Semantic SLAM Approach for Dynamic Scenes Based on LiDAR Point Clouds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18318v1)** | 2024-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Point cloud maps generated via LiDAR sensors using extensive remotely sensed data are commonly used by autonomous vehicles and robots for localization and navigation. However, dynamic objects contained in point cloud maps not only downgrade localization accuracy and navigation performance but also jeopardize the map quality. In response to this challenge, we propose in this paper a novel semantic SLAM approach for dynamic scenes based on LiDAR point clouds, referred to as SD-SLAM hereafter. The main contributions of this work are in three aspects: 1) introducing a semantic SLAM framework dedicatedly for dynamic scenes based on LiDAR point clouds, 2) Employing semantics and Kalman filtering to effectively differentiate between dynamic and semi-static landmarks, and 3) Making full use of semi-static and pure static landmarks with semantic information in the SD-SLAM process to improve localization and mapping performance. To evaluate the proposed SD-SLAM, tests were conducted using the widely adopted KITTI odometry dataset. Results demonstrate that the proposed SD-SLAM effectively mitigates the adverse effects of dynamic objects on SLAM, improving vehicle localization and mapping performance in dynamic scenes, and simultaneously constructing a static semantic map with multiple semantic classes for enhanced environment understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[3D Active Metric-Semantic SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06950v3)** | 2024-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this letter, we address the problem of exploration and metric-semantic mapping of multi-floor GPS-denied indoor environments using Size Weight and Power (SWaP) constrained aerial robots. Most previous work in exploration assumes that robot localization is solved. However, neglecting the state uncertainty of the agent can ultimately lead to cascading errors both in the resulting map and in the state of the agent itself. Furthermore, actions that reduce localization errors may be at direct odds with the exploration task. We propose a framework that balances the efficiency of exploration with actions that reduce the state uncertainty of the agent. In particular, our algorithmic approach for active metric-semantic SLAM is built upon sparse information abstracted from raw problem data, to make it suitable for SWaP-constrained robots. Furthermore, we integrate this framework within a fully autonomous aerial robotic system that achieves autonomous exploration in cluttered, 3D environments. From extensive real-world experiments, we showed that by including Semantic Loop Closure (SLC), we can reduce the robot pose estimation errors by over 90% in translation and approximately 75% in yaw, and the uncertainties in pose estimates and semantic maps by over 70% and 65%, respectively. Although discussed in the context of indoor multi-floor exploration, our system can be used for various other applications, such as infrastructure inspection and precision agriculture where reliable GPS data may not be available.</p></details> | Accepted by RA-L |
| **[Preferential Multi-Target Search in Indoor Environments using Semantic SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14063v3)** | 2024-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the demand for service robots capable of executing tasks beyond autonomous navigation has grown. In the future, service robots will be expected to perform complex tasks like 'Set table for dinner'. High-level tasks like these, require, among other capabilities, the ability to retrieve multiple targets. This paper delves into the challenge of locating multiple targets in an environment, termed 'Find my Objects.' We present a novel heuristic designed to facilitate robots in conducting a preferential search for multiple targets in indoor spaces. Our approach involves a Semantic SLAM framework that combines semantic object recognition with geometric data to generate a multi-layered map. We fuse the semantic maps with probabilistic priors for efficient inferencing. Recognizing the challenges introduced by obstacles that might obscure a navigation goal and render standard point-to-point navigation strategies less viable, our methodology offers resilience to such factors. Importantly, our method is adaptable to various object detectors, RGB-D SLAM techniques, and local navigation planners. We demonstrate the 'Find my Objects' task in real-world indoor environments, yielding quantitative results that attest to the effectiveness of our methodology. This strategy can be applied in scenarios where service robots need to locate, grasp, and transport objects, taking into account user preferences.

Additionally, Kimera-RPGO and Kimera-PGMO, Kimera's pose-graph optimization backends, are updated to support modern outlier rejection methods - specifically, Graduated-Non-Convexity - for improved robustness to spurious loop closures. These new features are evaluated extensively on a variety of simulated and real robotic platforms, including drones, quadrupeds, wheeled robots, and simulated self-driving cars. We present comparisons against several state-of-the-art visual-inertial SLAM pipelines and discuss strengths and weaknesses of the new release of Kimera.

While achieving impressive performance on small synthetic scenes, these methods often suffer from oversmoothed reconstructions, especially for complex real-world scenes. In this work, we introduce DNS SLAM, a novel neural RGB-D semantic SLAM approach featuring a hybrid representation. Relying only on 2D semantic priors, we propose the first semantic neural SLAM method that trains class-wise scene representations while providing stable camera tracking at the same time. Our method integrates multi-view geometry constraints with image-based feature extraction to improve appearance details and to output color, density, and semantic class information, enabling many downstream applications. To further enable real-time tracking, we introduce a lightweight coarse scene representation which is trained in a self-supervised manner in latent space. Our experimental results achieve state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic data and real-world data tracking while maintaining a commendable operational speed on off-the-shelf hardware. Further, our method outputs class-wise decomposed reconstructions with better texture capturing appearance and geometric details.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Accurate Loop Closure Detection in Semantic SLAM with 3D Semantic Covisibility Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12245v1)** | 2023-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Loop closure is necessary for correcting errors accumulated in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) in unknown environments. However, conventional loop closure methods based on low-level geometric or image features may cause high ambiguity by not distinguishing similar scenarios. Thus, incorrect loop closures can occur. Though semantic 2D image information is considered in some literature to detect loop closures, there is little work that compares 3D scenes as an integral part of a semantic SLAM system. This paper introduces an approach, called SmSLAM+LCD, integrated into a semantic SLAM system to combine high-level 3D semantic information and low-level feature information to conduct accurate loop closure detection and effective drift reduction. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated in testing results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Autonomous Search of Semantic Objects in Unknown Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13236v2)** | 2023-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the problem of enabling a robot to search for a semantic object, i.e., an object with a semantic label, in an unknown and GPS-denied environment. For the robot in the unknown environment to detect and find the target semantic object, it must perform simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) at both geometric and semantic levels using its onboard sensors while planning and executing its motion based on the ever-updated SLAM results. In other words, the robot must be able to conduct simultaneous localization, semantic mapping, motion planning, and execution in real-time in the presence of sensing and motion uncertainty. This is an open problem as it combines semantic SLAM based on perception and real-time motion planning and execution under uncertainty. Moreover, the goals of the robot motion change on the fly depending on whether and how the robot can detect the target object. We propose a novel approach to tackle the problem, leveraging semantic SLAM, Bayesian Networks, Markov Decision Process, and Real-Time Dynamic Programming. The results in simulation and real experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[3DS-SLAM: A 3D Object Detection based Semantic SLAM towards Dynamic Indoor Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06385v1)** | 2023-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The existence of variable factors within the environment can cause a decline in camera localization accuracy, as it violates the fundamental assumption of a static environment in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms. Recent semantic SLAM systems towards dynamic environments either rely solely on 2D semantic information, or solely on geometric information, or combine their results in a loosely integrated manner. In this research paper, we introduce 3DS-SLAM, 3D Semantic SLAM, tailored for dynamic scenes with visual 3D object detection. The 3DS-SLAM is a tightly-coupled algorithm resolving both semantic and geometric constraints sequentially. We designed a 3D part-aware hybrid transformer for point cloud-based object detection to identify dynamic objects. Subsequently, we propose a dynamic feature filter based on HDBSCAN clustering to extract objects with significant absolute depth differences. When compared against ORB-SLAM2, 3DS-SLAM exhibits an average improvement of 98.01% across the dynamic sequences of the TUM RGB-D dataset. Furthermore, it surpasses the performance of the other four leading SLAM systems designed for dynamic environments.</p></details> |  |

This representation is storage-efficient, less ambiguous, and more informative, thus facilitating large-scale autonomy and the acquisition of actionable information in highly unstructured, GPS-denied environments. In this letter, we propose an integrated system that can perform large-scale autonomous flights and real-time semantic mapping in challenging under-canopy environments. We detect and model tree trunks and ground planes from LiDAR data, which are associated across scans and used to constrain robot poses as well as tree trunk models. The autonomous navigation module utilizes a multi-level planning and mapping framework and computes dynamically feasible trajectories that lead the UAV to build a semantic map of the user-defined region of interest in a computationally and storage efficient manner. A drift-compensation mechanism is designed to minimize the odometry drift using semantic SLAM outputs in real time, while maintaining planner optimality and controller stability. This leads the UAV to execute its mission accurately and safely at scale.</p></details> | <details><summary>Xu Li...</summary><p>Xu Liu and Guilherme V.

One of the key implicit assumptions when solving cooperative multi-robot problems is that all robots use the same (homogeneous) underlying algorithm. However, in practice, we want to allow collaboration between robots possessing different capabilities and that therefore must rely on heterogeneous algorithms. We present a system architecture and the supporting theory, to enable collaboration in a decentralized network of robots, where each robot relies on different estimation algorithms. To develop our approach, we focus on multi-robot simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) with multi-target tracking. Our theoretical framework builds on our idea of exploiting the conditional independence structure inherent to many robotics applications to separate between each robot's local inference (estimation) tasks and fuse only relevant parts of their non-equal, but overlapping probability density function (pdfs). We present a new decentralized graph-based approach to the multi-robot SLAM and tracking problem. We leverage factor graphs to split between different parts of the problem for efficient data sharing between robots in the network while enabling robots to use different local sparse landmark/dense/metric-semantic SLAM algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures, presented at the ICRA 2023 workshop on "Distributed Graph Algorithms for Robotics"</p></details> |
| **[Neural Implicit Dense Semantic SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14560v2)** | 2023-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (vSLAM) is a widely used technique in robotics and computer vision that enables a robot to create a map of an unfamiliar environment using a camera sensor while simultaneously tracking its position over time. In this paper, we propose a novel RGBD vSLAM algorithm that can learn a memory-efficient, dense 3D geometry, and semantic segmentation of an indoor scene in an online manner. Our pipeline combines classical 3D vision-based tracking and loop closing with neural fields-based mapping. The mapping network learns the SDF of the scene as well as RGB, depth, and semantic maps of any novel view using only a set of keyframes. Additionally, we extend our pipeline to large scenes by using multiple local mapping networks. Extensive experiments on well-known benchmark datasets confirm that our approach provides robust tracking, mapping, and semantic labeling even with noisy, sparse, or no input depth. Overall, our proposed algorithm can greatly enhance scene perception and assist with a range of robot control problems.</p></details> |  |

Most CSLAM techniques rely on the transmission of low-level features for visual and LiDAR-based approaches, which are used for pose graph optimization. However, these low-level features can lead to incorrect loop closures, negatively impacting map generation.Recent approaches have proposed the use of high-level semantic information in the form of Hierarchical Semantic Graphs to improve the loop closure procedures and overall precision of SLAM algorithms. In this work, we present Multi S-Graphs, an S-graphs [1] based distributed CSLAM algorithm that utilizes high-level semantic information for cooperative map generation while minimizing the amount of information exchanged between robots.

Recent SLAM frameworks have been proposed to simultaneously track the camera and moving objects. However they are often unable to estimate the canonical pose of the objects and exhibit a low object tracking accuracy. To solve this problem we propose TwistSLAM++, a semantic, dynamic, SLAM system that fuses stereo images and LiDAR information. Using semantic information, we track potentially moving objects and associate them to 3D object detections in LiDAR scans to obtain their pose and size. Then, we perform registration on consecutive object scans to refine object pose estimation. Finally, object scans are used to estimate the shape of the object and constrain map points to lie on the estimated surface within the BA. We show on classical benchmarks that this fusion approach based on multimodal information improves the accuracy of object tracking.</p></details> |  |

Several SLAM systems with impressive performance have been invented and used during the last several decades. However, there are still unresolved issues, such as how to deal with moving objects in dynamic situations. Classic SLAM systems depend on the assumption of a static environment, which becomes unworkable in highly dynamic situations. Several methods have been presented to tackle this issue in recent years, but each has its limitations. This research combines the visual SLAM systems ORB-SLAM3 and Detectron2 to present the Det-SLAM system, which employs depth information and semantic segmentation to identify and eradicate dynamic spots to accomplish semantic SLAM for dynamic situations. Evaluation of public TUM datasets indicates that Det-SLAM is more resilient than previous dynamic SLAM systems and can lower the estimated error of camera posture in dynamic indoor scenarios.</p></details> | 5 pages, 2 figures |

Quadrics and cubes are often used to represent objects, but their single shape limits the accuracy of object map and thus affects the application of downstream tasks. In this paper, we introduce superquadrics (SQ) with shape parameters into SLAM for representing objects, and propose a separate parameter estimation method that can accurately estimate object pose and adapt to different shapes. Furthermore, we present a lightweight data association strategy for correctly associating semantic observations in multiple views with object landmarks. We implement a monocular semantic SLAM system with real-time performance and conduct comprehensive experiments on public datasets. The results show that our method is able to build accurate object map and has advantages in object representation.

The objects may be moved by inhabitants, but not completely at random. The robot may be called upon later to retrieve objects and will need a long-term object-based memory in order to know how to find them. Existing work in semantic slam does not attempt to capture the dynamics of object movement. In this paper, we combine some aspects of classic techniques for data-association filtering with modern attention-based neural networks to construct object-based memory systems that operate on high-dimensional observations and hypotheses. We perform end-to-end learning on labeled observation trajectories to learn both the transition and observation models. We demonstrate the system's effectiveness in maintaining memory of dynamically changing objects in both simulated environment and real images, and demonstrate improvements over classical structured approaches as well as unstructured neural approaches.

One of the challenges in this field is to obtain object classification jointly with robot trajectory estimation. Considering view-dependent semantic measurements, there is a coupling between different classes, resulting in a combinatorial number of hypotheses. A common solution is to prune hypotheses that have a sufficiently low probability and to retain only a limited number of hypotheses. However, after pruning and renormalization, the updated probability is overconfident with respect to the original probability. This is especially problematic for systems that require high accuracy. If the prior probability of the classes is independent, the original normalization factor can be computed efficiently without pruning hypotheses. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to present these results. If the prior probability of the classes is dependent, we propose a lower bound on the normalization factor that ensures cautious results. The bound is calculated incrementally and with similar efficiency as in the independent case. After pruning and updating based on the bound, this belief is shown empirically to be close to the original belief.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 12 figures, accepted to IROS</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose the use of an efficient representation, based on structural points, for the geometry of objects to be used as landmarks in a monocular semantic SLAM system based on the pose-graph formulation. In particular, an inverse depth parametrization is proposed for the landmark nodes in the pose-graph to store object position, orientation and size/scale. The proposed formulation is general and it can be applied to different geometries; in this paper we focus on indoor environments where human-made artifacts commonly share a planar rectangular shape, e.g., windows, doors, cabinets, etc. The approach can be easily extended to urban scenarios where similar shapes exists as well. Experiments in simulation show good performance, particularly in object geometry reconstruction.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to IROS 2015 (rejected)</p></details> |

Recently, however, the community has realized that progress towards robust intelligent systems such as self-driving cars requires a concerted effort across the different fields. This motivated us to develop KITTI-360, successor of the popular KITTI dataset. KITTI-360 is a suburban driving dataset which comprises richer input modalities, comprehensive semantic instance annotations and accurate localization to facilitate research at the intersection of vision, graphics and robotics. For efficient annotation, we created a tool to label 3D scenes with bounding primitives and developed a model that transfers this information into the 2D image domain, resulting in over 150k images and 1B 3D points with coherent semantic instance annotations across 2D and 3D. Moreover, we established benchmarks and baselines for several tasks relevant to mobile perception, encompassing problems from computer vision, graphics, and robotics on the same dataset, e.g., semantic scene understanding, novel view synthesis and semantic SLAM. KITTI-360 will enable progress at the intersection of these research areas and thus contribute towards solving one of today's grand challenges: the development of fully autonomous self-driving systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1511.03240</p></details> |
| **[Multi-modal Semantic SLAM for Complex Dynamic Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04300v2)** | 2022-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is one of the most essential techniques in many real-world robotic applications. The assumption of static environments is common in most SLAM algorithms, which however, is not the case for most applications. Recent work on semantic SLAM aims to understand the objects in an environment and distinguish dynamic information from a scene context by performing image-based segmentation. However, the segmentation results are often imperfect or incomplete, which can subsequently reduce the quality of mapping and the accuracy of localization. In this paper, we present a robust multi-modal semantic framework to solve the SLAM problem in complex and highly dynamic environments. We propose to learn a more powerful object feature representation and deploy the mechanism of looking and thinking twice to the backbone network, which leads to a better recognition result to our baseline instance segmentation model. Moreover, both geometric-only clustering and visual semantic information are combined to reduce the effect of segmentation error due to small-scale objects, occlusion and motion blur. Thorough experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The results show that our method can precisely identify dynamic objects under recognition imperfection and motion blur. Moreover, the proposed SLAM framework is able to efficiently build a static dense map at a processing rate of more than 10 Hz, which can be implemented in many practical applications. Both training data and the proposed method is open sourced at https://github.com/wh200720041/MMS_SLAM.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present a method for semantic dense reconstruction of the OR scene using multiple RGB-D cameras attached and registered to the da Vinci Xi surgical system. We developed a novel SLAM approach for robot pose tracking in dynamic OR environments and dense reconstruction of the static OR table object. We validated our techniques in a mock OR by collecting data sequences with corresponding optical tracking trajectories as ground truth and manually annotated 100 frame segmentation masks. The mean absolute trajectory error is $11.4\pm1.9$ mm and the mean relative pose error is $1.53\pm0.48$ degrees per second. The segmentation DICE score is improved from 0.814 to 0.902 by using our SLAM system compared to single frame. Our approach effectively produces a dense OR table reconstruction in dynamic clinical environments as well as improved semantic segmentation on individual image frames.</p></details> |  |

Previously, SLAM was carried out using lower level geometric features (points, lines, and planes) which are often view-point dependent and error prone in visually repetitive environments. Semantic information can improve the ability to recognise previously visited locations, as well as maintain sparser maps for long term SLAM applications. However, SLAM in repetitive environments has the critical problem of assigning measurements to the landmarks which generated them. In this paper, we use k-best assignment enumeration to compute marginal assignment probabilities for each measurement landmark pair, in real time.

The environment is assumed to have known geometric structure (e.g., walls) and to be occupied by static labeled landmarks with uncertain positions and classes. This modeling approach gives rise to an uncertain semantic map generated by semantic SLAM algorithms. Our goal is to design control policies for robots equipped with noisy perception systems so that they can accomplish collaborative tasks captured by global temporal logic specifications. To specify missions that account for environmental and perceptual uncertainty, we employ a fragment of Linear Temporal Logic (LTL), called co-safe LTL, defined over perception-based atomic predicates modeling probabilistic satisfaction requirements. The perception-based LTL planning problem gives rise to an optimal control problem, solved by a novel sampling-based algorithm, that generates open-loop control policies that are updated online to adapt to a continuously learned semantic map. We provide extensive experiments to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed planning architecture.</p></details> |  |
| **[Accurate Object Association and Pose Updating for Semantic SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.11368v3)** | 2021-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current pandemic has caused the medical system to operate under high load. To relieve it, robots with high autonomy can be used to effectively execute contactless operations in hospitals and reduce cross-infection between medical staff and patients. Although semantic Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) technology can improve the autonomy of robots, semantic object association is still a problem that is worthy of being studied. The key to solving this problem is to correctly associate multiple object measurements of one object landmark by using semantic information, and to refine the pose of object landmark in real time. To this end, we propose a hierarchical object association strategy and a pose-refinement approach. The former one consists of two levels, i.e., a short-term object association and a global one. In the first level, we employ the multiple-object-tracking for short-term object association, through which the incorrect association among objects whose locations are close and appearances are similar can be avoided. Moreover, the short-term object association can provide more abundant object appearance and more robust estimation of object pose for the global object association in the second level. To refine the object pose in the map, we develop an approach to choose the optimal object pose from all object measurements associated with an object landmark. The proposed method is comprehensively evaluated on seven simulated hospital sequences1, a real hospital environment and the KITTI dataset. Experimental results show that our method has an obviously improvement in terms of robustness and accuracy for the object association and the trajectory estimation in the semantic SLAM.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

Kimera-Multi is implemented by a team of robots equipped with visual-inertial sensors. Each robot builds a local trajectory estimate and a local mesh using Kimera. When communication is available, robots initiate a distributed place recognition and robust pose graph optimization protocol based on a novel distributed graduated non-convexity algorithm. The proposed protocol allows the robots to improve their local trajectory estimates by leveraging inter-robot loop closures while being robust to outliers. Finally, each robot uses its improved trajectory estimate to correct the local mesh using mesh deformation techniques. We demonstrate Kimera-Multi in photo-realistic simulations, SLAM benchmarking datasets, and challenging outdoor datasets collected using ground robots. Both real and simulated experiments involve long trajectories (e.g., up to 800 meters per robot). The experiments show that Kimera-Multi (i) outperforms the state of the art in terms of robustness and accuracy, (ii) achieves estimation errors comparable to a centralized SLAM system while being fully distributed, (iii) is parsimonious in terms of communication bandwidth, (iv) produces accurate metric-semantic 3D meshes, and (v) is modular and can be also used for standard 3D reconstruction (i.e., without semantic labels) or for trajectory estimation (i.e., without reconstructing a 3D mesh).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Robotics (18 pages, 15 figures)</p></details> |
| **[Superquadric Object Representation for Optimization-based Semantic SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.09627v1)** | 2021-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Introducing semantically meaningful objects to visual Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) has the potential to improve both the accuracy and reliability of pose estimates, especially in challenging scenarios with significant view-point and appearance changes. However, how semantic objects should be represented for an efficient inclusion in optimization-based SLAM frameworks is still an open question. Superquadrics(SQs) are an efficient and compact object representation, able to represent most common object types to a high degree, and typically retrieved from 3D point-cloud data. However, accurate 3D point-cloud data might not be available in all applications. Recent advancements in machine learning enabled robust object recognition and semantic mask measurements from camera images under many different appearance conditions. We propose a pipeline to leverage such semantic mask measurements to fit SQ parameters to multi-view camera observations using a multi-stage initialization and optimization procedure. We demonstrate the system's ability to retrieve randomly generated SQ parameters from multi-view mask observations in preliminary simulation experiments and evaluate different initialization stages and cost functions.</p></details> |  |

In this paper we evaluate the quality of semantic maps generated by state-of-the-art class- and instance-aware dense semantic SLAM algorithms whose codes are publicly available and explore the impacts both semantic segmentation and pose estimation have on the quality of semantic maps. We obtain these results by providing algorithms with ground-truth pose and/or semantic segmentation data available from simulated environments.

The goal is to detect corn stalks and localize them in a global coordinate frame. This is a challenging setup for existing algorithms because there is very little space between the camera and the plants, and the camera motion is primarily restricted to be along the row. To overcome these challenges, we present a multi-camera system where a side camera (facing the plants) is used for detection whereas front and back cameras are used for motion estimation. Next, we show how semantic features in the environment (corn stalks, ground, and crop planes) can be used to develop a robust semantic SLAM solution and present results from field trials performed throughout the growing season across various cornfields.</p></details> | 7 pages, 6 figures |

We contribute a unified framework for inference and belief space planning (BSP) that addresses prominent sources of uncertainty in this context: classification aliasing (classier cannot distinguish between candidate classes from certain viewpoints), classifier epistemic uncertainty (classifier receives data "far" from its training set), and localization uncertainty (camera and object poses are uncertain). Specifically, we develop two methods for maintaining a joint distribution over robot and object poses, and over posterior class probability vector that considers epistemic uncertainty in a Bayesian fashion. The first approach is Multi-Hybrid (MH), where multiple hybrid beliefs over poses and classes are maintained to approximate the joint belief over poses and posterior class probability. The second approach is Joint Lambda Pose (JLP), where the joint belief is maintained directly using a novel JLP factor. Furthermore, we extend both methods to BSP, planning while reasoning about future posterior epistemic uncertainty indirectly, or directly via a novel information-theoretic reward function. Both inference methods utilize a novel viewpoint-dependent classifier uncertainty model that leverages the coupling between poses and classification scores and predicts the epistemic uncertainty from certain viewpoints. In addition, this model is used to generate predicted measurements during planning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that reasons about classifier epistemic uncertainty within semantic SLAM and BSP.</p></details> | <details><summary>44 pa...</summary><p>44 pages, 38 figures, submitted to Autonomous Robots Journal (ARJ)</p></details> |
| **[SuMa++: Efficient LiDAR-based Semantic SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.11320v1)** | 2021-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reliable and accurate localization and mapping are key components of most autonomous systems. Besides geometric information about the mapped environment, the semantics plays an important role to enable intelligent navigation behaviors. In most realistic environments, this task is particularly complicated due to dynamics caused by moving objects, which can corrupt the mapping step or derail localization. In this paper, we propose an extension of a recently published surfel-based mapping approach exploiting three-dimensional laser range scans by integrating semantic information to facilitate the mapping process. The semantic information is efficiently extracted by a fully convolutional neural network and rendered on a spherical projection of the laser range data. This computed semantic segmentation results in point-wise labels for the whole scan, allowing us to build a semantically-enriched map with labeled surfels. This semantic map enables us to reliably filter moving objects, but also improve the projective scan matching via semantic constraints. Our experimental evaluation on challenging highways sequences from KITTI dataset with very few static structures and a large amount of moving cars shows the advantage of our semantic SLAM approach in comparison to a purely geometric, state-of-the-art approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IROS 2019.

| **[Multiple Hypothesis Semantic Mapping for Robust Data Association](http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.04423v1)** | 2020-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present a semantic mapping approach with multiple hypothesis tracking for data association. As semantic information has the potential to overcome ambiguity in measurements and place recognition, it forms an eminent modality for autonomous systems. This is particularly evident in urban scenarios with several similar looking surroundings. Nevertheless, it requires the handling of a non-Gaussian and discrete random variable coming from object detectors. Previous methods facilitate semantic information for global localization and data association to reduce the instance ambiguity between the landmarks. However, many of these approaches do not deal with the creation of complete globally consistent representations of the environment and typically do not scale well. We utilize multiple hypothesis trees to derive a probabilistic data association for semantic measurements by means of position, instance and class to create a semantic representation. We propose an optimized mapping method and make use of a pose graph to derive a novel semantic SLAM solution. Furthermore, we show that semantic covisibility graphs allow for a precise place recognition in urban environments. We verify our approach using real-world outdoor dataset and demonstrate an average drift reduction of 33 % w.r.t. the raw odometry source. Moreover, our approach produces 55 % less hypotheses on average than a regular multiple hypotheses approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semantic SLAM with Autonomous Object-Level Data Association](http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.10625v1)** | 2020-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is often desirable to capture and map semantic information of an environment during simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Such semantic information can enable a robot to better distinguish places with similar low-level geometric and visual features and perform high-level tasks that use semantic information about objects to be manipulated and environments to be navigated. While semantic SLAM has gained increasing attention, there is little research on semanticlevel data association based on semantic objects, i.e., object-level data association. In this paper, we propose a novel object-level data association algorithm based on bag of words algorithm, formulated as a maximum weighted bipartite matching problem. With object-level data association solved, we develop a quadratic-programming-based semantic object initialization scheme using dual quadric and introduce additional constraints to improve the success rate of object initialization. The integrated semantic-level SLAM system can achieve high-accuracy object-level data association and real-time semantic mapping as demonstrated in the experiments. The online semantic map building and semantic-level localization capabilities facilitate semantic-level mapping and task planning in a priori unknown environment.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose an ensemble data associate strategy for integrating the parametric and nonparametric statistic tests. By exploiting the nature of different statistics, our method can effectively aggregate the information of different measurements, and thus significantly improve the robustness and accuracy of data association. We then present an accurate object pose estimation framework, in which an outliers-robust centroid and scale estimation algorithm and an object pose initialization algorithm are developed to help improve the optimality of pose estimation results. Furthermore, we build a SLAM system that can generate semi-dense or lightweight object-oriented maps with a monocular camera. Extensive experiments are conducted on three publicly available datasets and a real scenario.

In particular, we utilize a viewpoint-dependent classifier model to leverage the coupling between semantics and geometry. Moreover, our approach yields a consistent estimation of both continuous and discrete variables, with the latter being addressed for the first time, to the best of our knowledge. We evaluate the performance of our approach in a multi-robot semantic SLAM simulation and in a real-world experiment, demonstrating an increase in both classification and localization accuracy compared to maintaining a hybrid belief using local information only.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 73 figures, for an associated video, see https://youtu.be/jATog1snfwc</p></details> |

The library goes beyond existing visual and visual-inertial SLAM libraries (e.g., ORB-SLAM, VINS- Mono, OKVIS, ROVIO) by enabling mesh reconstruction and semantic labeling in 3D. Kimera is designed with modularity in mind and has four key components: a visual-inertial odometry (VIO) module for fast and accurate state estimation, a robust pose graph optimizer for global trajectory estimation, a lightweight 3D mesher module for fast mesh reconstruction, and a dense 3D metric-semantic reconstruction module. The modules can be run in isolation or in combination, hence Kimera can easily fall back to a state-of-the-art VIO or a full SLAM system. Kimera runs in real-time on a CPU and produces a 3D metric-semantic mesh from semantically labeled images, which can be obtained by modern deep learning methods. We hope that the flexibility, computational efficiency, robustness, and accuracy afforded by Kimera will build a solid basis for future metric-semantic SLAM and perception research, and will allow researchers across multiple areas (e.g., VIO, SLAM, 3D reconstruction, segmentation) to benchmark and prototype their own efforts without having to start from scratch.</p></details> | 8 pages |

Traditional SLAM approaches rely heavily on low-level geometric constraints like corners or lines, which may lead to tracking failure in textureless surroundings or cluttered world with dynamic objects. In this paper, a compact semantic SLAM framework is proposed, with utilization of both geometric and object-level semantic constraints jointly, a more consistent mapping result, and more accurate pose estimation can be obtained. Two main contributions are presented int the paper, a) a robust and efficient SLAM data association and optimization framework is proposed, it models both discrete semantic labeling and continuous pose. b) a compact map representation, combining 2D Lidar map with object detection is presented. Experiments on public indoor datasets, TUM-RGBD, ICL-NUIM, and our own collected datasets prove the improving of SLAM robustness and accuracy compared to other popular SLAM systems, meanwhile a map maintenance efficiency can be achieved.</p></details> | 8 pages, 11 figures |

We aim to develop robots that can use all of these sources of information for reliable navigation, but each is corrupted by noise. Rather than assume that object detection will eventually achieve near perfect performance across the lifetime of a robot, in this work we represent and cope with the semantic and geometric uncertainty inherent in methods like object detection. Specifically, we model data association ambiguity, which is typically non-Gaussian, in a way that is amenable to solution within the common nonlinear Gaussian formulation of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). We do so by eliminating data association variables from the inference process through max-marginalization, preserving standard Gaussian posterior assumptions. The result is a max-mixture-type model that accounts for multiple data association hypotheses as well as incorrect loop closures. We provide experimental results on indoor and outdoor semantic navigation tasks with noisy odometry and object detection and find that the ability of the proposed approach to represent multiple hypotheses, including the "null" hypothesis, gives substantial robustness advantages in comparison to alternative semantic SLAM approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Autho...</summary><p>Authors D.

While sparse point-based SLAM methods provide accurate camera localization, the generated maps lack semantic information. On the other hand, state of the art object detection methods provide rich information about entities present in the scene from a single image. This work incorporates a real-time deep-learned object detector to the monocular SLAM framework for representing generic objects as quadrics that permit detections to be seamlessly integrated while allowing the real-time performance. Finer reconstruction of an object, learned by a CNN network, is also incorporated and provides a shape prior for the quadric leading further refinement. To capture the dominant structure of the scene, additional planar landmarks are detected by a CNN-based plane detector and modeled as independent landmarks in the map. Extensive experiments support our proposed inclusion of semantic objects and planar structures directly in the bundle-adjustment of SLAM - Semantic SLAM - that enriches the reconstructed map semantically, while significantly improving the camera localization.

When ambiguous measurements arise, conservatism often mandates that the measurement is discarded or a new landmark is initialized rather than risking an incorrect association. To address the inevitable `duplicate' landmarks that arise, we present an efficient map-merging framework to detect duplicate constellations of landmarks, providing a high-confidence loop-closure mechanism well-suited for object-level SLAM. This approach uses an incrementally-computable approximation of landmark uncertainty that only depends on local information in the SLAM graph, avoiding expensive recovery of the full system covariance matrix. This enables a search based on geometric consistency (GC) (rather than full joint compatibility (JC)) that inexpensively reduces the search space to a handful of `best' hypotheses. Furthermore, we reformulate the commonly-used interpretation tree to allow for more efficient integration of clique-based pairwise compatibility, accelerating the branch-and-bound max-cardinality search. Our method is demonstrated to match the performance of full JC methods at significantly-reduced computational cost, facilitating robust object-based loop-closure over large SLAM problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) 2019</p></details> |

Recent studies on object detection and feature extraction have become important for scene understanding and 3D mapping. However, 3D shape of the object is too complex to formulate the probabilistic observation model; therefore, performing the Bayesian inference of the object-oriented features as well as their pose is less considered. Besides, when the robot equipped with an RGB mono camera only observes the projected single view of an object, a significant amount of the 3D shape information is abandoned. Due to these limitations, semantic SLAM and viewpoint-independent loop closure using volumetric 3D object shape is challenging. In order to enable the complete formulation of probabilistic semantic SLAM, we approximate the observation model of a 3D object with a tractable distribution. We also estimate the variational likelihood from the 2D image of the object to exploit its observed single view.

Recent approaches to object recognition methods become important for semantic simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). However, there is a lack of consideration of the probabilistic observation model for 3D objects, as the shape of a 3D object basically follows a complex probability distribution. Furthermore, since the mobile robot equipped with a range sensor observes only a single view, much information of the object shape is discarded. These limitations are the major obstacles to semantic SLAM and view-independent loop closure using 3D object shapes as features. In order to enable the numerical analysis for the Bayesian inference, we approximate the true observation model of 3D objects to tractable distributions. Since the observation likelihood can be obtained from the generative model, we formulate the true generative model for 3D object with the Bayesian networks. To capture these complex distributions, we apply a variational auto-encoder. To analyze the approximated distributions and encoded features, we perform classification with maximum likelihood estimation and shape retrieval.</p></details> | <details><summary>to ap...</summary><p>to appear in the proceedings of IROS 2018</p></details> |

Existing Neural SLAM or 3DGS-based SLAM methods often trade off between rendering quality and geometry accuracy, our research demonstrates that both can be achieved simultaneously with RGB input alone. The key idea of our approach is to enhance the ability for geometry estimation by combining easy-to-obtain monocular priors with learning-based dense SLAM, and then using 3D Gaussian splatting as our core map representation to efficiently model the scene. Upon loop closure, our method ensures on-the-fly global consistency through efficient pose graph bundle adjustment and instant map updates by explicitly deforming the 3D Gaussian units based on anchored keyframe updates. Furthermore, we introduce a grid-based scale alignment strategy to maintain improved scale consistency in prior depths for finer depth details. Through extensive experiments on Replica, ScanNet, and ScanNet++, we demonstrate significant improvements over existing Neural SLAM methods and even surpass RGB-D-based methods in both reconstruction and rendering quality.

Pose-free scene reconstruction from incomplete, pose-free observations is usually regularized with depth estimation or 3D foundational priors. While recent advances have enabled sparse-view reconstruction of large complex scenes (with high degree of foreground and background detail) with known camera poses using view-conditioned generative priors, these methods cannot be directly adapted for the pose-free setting when ground-truth poses are not available during evaluation. To address this, we propose an image-to-image generative model designed to inpaint missing details and remove artifacts in novel view renders and depth maps of a 3D scene. We introduce context and geometry conditioning using Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) modulation layers as a lightweight alternative to cross-attention and also propose a novel confidence measure for 3D Gaussian splat representations to allow for better detection of these artifacts. By progressively integrating these novel views in a Gaussian-SLAM-inspired process, we achieve a multi-view-consistent 3D representation. Evaluations on the MipNeRF360 and DL3DV-10K benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method surpasses existing pose-free techniques and performs competitively with state-of-the-art posed (precomputed camera parameters are given) reconstruction methods in complex 360 scenes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page is available at https://gaussianscenes.github.io/</p></details> |

While previous 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS)-based methods largely depended on depth sensors, our approach reduces the hardware dependency and only requires RGB input, leveraging online visual odometry (VO) to generate sparse point clouds in real-time. To reduce redundancy and enhance the quality of 3D scene reconstruction, we implemented a series of methodological enhancements in 3D Gaussian mapping. Firstly, we introduced dynamic 3D Gaussian insertion to avoid adding redundant Gaussians in previously well-reconstructed areas. Secondly, we introduced clarity-enhancing Gaussian densification module and planar regularization to handle texture-less areas and flat surfaces better. We achieved precise camera tracking results both on the synthetic Replica and real-world TUM-RGBD datasets, comparable to those of the state-of-the-art.

By seamlessly integrating fused line segments derived from structured scenes, our method ensures robust tracking in textureless indoor areas. Moreover, The extracted lines and planar surface assumption allow strategic interpolation of new Gaussians in regions of missing geometry, enabling efficient scene completion. Extensive experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world scenes demonstrate that these advancements enable our method to achieve state-of-the-art performance, marking a substantial improvement in the capabilities of Gaussian SLAM systems.</p></details> |  |

Notably, our OVO has a significantly lower computational and memory footprint than offline baselines, while also showing better segmentation metrics than them. Along with superior segmentation performance, we also show experimental results of our mapping contributions integrated with two different SLAM backbones (Gaussian-SLAM and ORB-SLAM2), being the first ones demonstrating end-to-end open-vocabulary online 3D reconstructions without relying on ground-truth camera poses or scene geometry.</p></details> |  |

The parameter usage in semantic SLAM systems increases significantly with the growing complexity of the environment, making scene understanding particularly challenging and costly. To address this problem, we introduce a novel and general hierarchical representation that encodes both semantic and geometric information in a compact form into 3D Gaussian Splatting, leveraging the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) as well as the 3D generative model. By utilizing the proposed hierarchical tree structure, semantic information is symbolically represented and learned in an end-to-end manner. We further introduce a novel semantic loss designed to optimize hierarchical semantic information through both inter-level and cross-level optimization. Additionally, we propose an improved SLAM system to support both RGB-D and monocular inputs using a feed-forward model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first semantic monocular Gaussian Splatting SLAM system, significantly reducing sensor requirements for 3D semantic understanding and broadening the applicability of semantic Gaussian SLAM system. We conduct experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating superior or on-par performance with state-of-the-art NeRF-based and Gaussian-based SLAM systems, while significantly reducing storage and training time requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages.

However, their reliance on extensive keyframes is impractical for deployment in real-world robotic systems, which typically operate under sparse-view conditions that can result in substantial holes in the map. To address these challenges, we introduce DenseSplat, the first SLAM system that effectively combines the advantages of NeRF and 3DGS. DenseSplat utilizes sparse keyframes and NeRF priors for initializing primitives that densely populate maps and seamlessly fill gaps. It also implements geometry-aware primitive sampling and pruning strategies to manage granularity and enhance rendering efficiency. Moreover, DenseSplat integrates loop closure and bundle adjustment, significantly enhancing frame-to-frame tracking accuracy. Extensive experiments on multiple large-scale datasets demonstrate that DenseSplat achieves superior performance in tracking and mapping compared to current state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

The framework comprises four main components: VIO Front End, 2D Gaussian Map, NVS Loop Closure, and Dynamic Eraser. In the VIO Front End, RGB frames are processed through dense bundle adjustment and uncertainty estimation to extract scene geometry and poses. Based on this output, the mapping module incrementally constructs and maintains a 2D Gaussian map. Key components of the 2D Gaussian Map include a Sample-based Rasterizer, Score Manager, and Pose Refinement, which collectively improve mapping speed and localization accuracy. This enables the SLAM system to handle large-scale urban environments with up to 50 million Gaussian ellipsoids. To ensure global consistency in large-scale scenes, we design a Loop Closure module, which innovatively leverages the Novel View Synthesis (NVS) capabilities of Gaussian Splatting for loop closure detection and correction of the Gaussian map. Additionally, we propose a Dynamic Eraser to address the inevitable presence of dynamic objects in real-world outdoor scenes. Extensive evaluations in indoor and outdoor environments demonstrate that our approach achieves localization performance on par with Visual-Inertial Odometry while surpassing recent GS/NeRF SLAM methods. It also significantly outperforms all existing methods in terms of mapping and rendering quality. Furthermore, we developed a mobile app and verified that our framework can generate high-quality Gaussian maps in real time using only a smartphone camera and a low-frequency IMU sensor. To the best of our knowledge, VINGS-Mono is the first monocular Gaussian SLAM method capable of operating in outdoor environments and supporting kilometer-scale large scenes.</p></details> |  |

However, existing Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) methods generally focus on either geometric or semantic reconstruction. In this paper, we introduce PanoSLAM, the first SLAM system to integrate geometric reconstruction, 3D semantic segmentation, and 3D instance segmentation within a unified framework. Our approach builds upon 3D Gaussian Splatting, modified with several critical components to enable efficient rendering of depth, color, semantic, and instance information from arbitrary viewpoints. To achieve panoptic 3D scene reconstruction from sequential RGB-D videos, we propose an online Spatial-Temporal Lifting (STL) module that transfers 2D panoptic predictions from vision models into 3D Gaussian representations. This STL module addresses the challenges of label noise and inconsistencies in 2D predictions by refining the pseudo labels across multi-view inputs, creating a coherent 3D representation that enhances segmentation accuracy. Our experiments show that PanoSLAM outperforms recent semantic SLAM methods in both mapping and tracking accuracy. For the first time, it achieves panoptic 3D reconstruction of open-world environments directly from the RGB-D video. (https://github.com/runnanchen/PanoSLAM)</p></details> |  |

However, current methods either lack dense depth maps to supervise the mapping process or detailed training designs that consider the scale of the environment. To address these drawbacks, we present IG-SLAM, a dense RGB-only SLAM system that employs robust Dense-SLAM methods for tracking and combines them with Gaussian Splatting. A 3D map of the environment is constructed using accurate pose and dense depth provided by tracking. Additionally, we utilize depth uncertainty in map optimization to improve 3D reconstruction. Our decay strategy in map optimization enhances convergence and allows the system to run at 10 fps in a single process. We demonstrate competitive performance with state-of-the-art RGB-only SLAM systems while achieving faster operation speeds. We present our experiments on the Replica, TUM-RGBD, ScanNet, and EuRoC datasets.

Existing methods have achieved encouraging results on RGB-D SLAM, but studies of the monocular case are still scarce. Moreover, they also fail to correct drift errors due to the lack of loop closure and global optimization. In this paper, we present MG-SLAM, a monocular Gaussian SLAM with a language-extended loop closure module capable of performing drift-corrected tracking and high-fidelity reconstruction while achieving a high-level understanding of the environment. Our key idea is to represent the global map as 3D Gaussian and use it to guide the estimation of the scene geometry, thus mitigating the efforts of missing depth information. Further, an additional language-extended loop closure module which is based on CLIP feature is designed to continually perform global optimization to correct drift errors accumulated as the system runs. Our system shows promising results on multiple challenging datasets in both tracking and mapping and even surpasses some existing RGB-D methods.</p></details> |  |

The system features a compact Gaussian representation and a highly efficient on-the-fly Gaussian optimization scheme. We force each Gaussian to be either opaque or nearly transparent, with the opaque ones fitting the surface and dominant colors, and transparent ones fitting residual colors. By rendering depth in a different way from color rendering, we let a single opaque Gaussian well fit a local surface region without the need of multiple overlapping Gaussians, hence largely reducing the memory and computation cost. For on-the-fly Gaussian optimization, we explicitly add Gaussians for three types of pixels per frame: newly observed, with large color errors, and with large depth errors. We also categorize all Gaussians into stable and unstable ones, where the stable Gaussians are expected to well fit previously observed RGBD images and otherwise unstable. We only optimize the unstable Gaussians and only render the pixels occupied by unstable Gaussians. In this way, both the number of Gaussians to be optimized and pixels to be rendered are largely reduced, and the optimization can be done in real time. We show real-time reconstructions of a variety of large scenes. Compared with the state-of-the-art NeRF-based RGBD SLAM, our system achieves comparable high-quality reconstruction but with around twice the speed and half the memory cost, and shows superior performance in the realism of novel view synthesis and camera tracking accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in ACM SIGGRAPH 2024</p></details> |

However, real-time full posterior inference techniques, such as Gaussian approximation and particle filters, either lack expressiveness for representing non-Gaussian posteriors or suffer from performance degeneracy when estimating high-dimensional posteriors. Inspired by the complementary strengths of Gaussian approximation and particle filters$\unicode{x2013}$scalability and non-Gaussian estimation, respectively$\unicode{x2013}$we blend these two approaches to infer marginal posteriors in SLAM. Specifically, Gaussian approximation provides robot pose distributions on which particle filters are conditioned to sample landmark marginals. In return, the maximum a posteriori point among these samples can be used to reset linearization points in the nonlinear optimization solver of the Gaussian approximation, facilitating the pursuit of global optima. We demonstrate the scalability, generalizability, and accuracy of our algorithm for real-time full posterior inference on realworld range-only SLAM and object-based bearing-only SLAM datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures.

| **[Nested Sampling for Non-Gaussian Inference in SLAM Factor Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.10871v3)** | 2022-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present nested sampling for factor graphs (NSFG), a novel nested sampling approach to approximate inference for posterior distributions expressed over factor-graphs. Performing such inference is a key step in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Although the Gaussian approximation often works well, in other more challenging SLAM situations, the posterior distribution is non-Gaussian and cannot be explicitly represented with standard distributions. Our technique applies to settings where the posterior distribution is substantially non-Gaussian (e.g., multi-modal) and thus needs a more expressive representation. NSFG exploits nested sampling methods to directly sample the posterior to represent the distribution without parametric density models. While nested sampling methods are known for their powerful capability in sampling multi-modal distributions, the application of the methods to SLAM factor graphs is not straightforward. NSFG leverages the structure of factor graphs to construct informative prior distributions which are efficiently sampled and provide notable computational benefits for nested sampling methods. We present simulated experiments which demonstrate that NSFG is more robust and computes solutions over an order of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art sampling techniques. Similarly, we compare NSFG to state-of-the-art Gaussian and non-Gaussian SLAM approaches and demonstrate that NSFG is notably more robust in describing non-Gaussian posteriors.</p></details> |  |

Early methods based on procedural rules offered scalability but limited diversity. Recent advances in deep generative models (e.g., GANs, diffusion models) and 3D representations (e.g., NeRF, 3D Gaussians) have enabled the learning of real-world scene distributions, improving fidelity, diversity, and view consistency. Recent advances like diffusion models bridge 3D scene synthesis and photorealism by reframing generation as image or video synthesis problems. This survey provides a systematic overview of state-of-the-art approaches, organizing them into four paradigms: procedural generation, neural 3D-based generation, image-based generation, and video-based generation. We analyze their technical foundations, trade-offs, and representative results, and review commonly used datasets, evaluation protocols, and downstream applications. We conclude by discussing key challenges in generation capacity, 3D representation, data and annotations, and evaluation, and outline promising directions including higher fidelity, physics-aware and interactive generation, and unified perception-generation models. This review organizes recent advances in 3D scene generation and highlights promising directions at the intersection of generative AI, 3D vision, and embodied intelligence.

DSDrive leverages a compact LLM that employs a distillation method to preserve the enhanced reasoning capabilities of a larger-sized vision language model (VLM). To effectively align the reasoning and planning tasks, a waypoint-driven dual-head coordination module is further developed, which synchronizes dataset structures, optimization objectives, and the learning process. By integrating these tasks into a unified framework, DSDrive anchors on the planning results while incorporating detailed reasoning insights, thereby enhancing the interpretability and reliability of the end-to-end pipeline. DSDrive has been thoroughly tested in closed-loop simulations, where it performs on par with benchmark models and even outperforms in many key metrics, all while being more compact in size. Additionally, the computational efficiency of DSDrive (as reflected in its time and memory requirements during inference) has been significantly enhanced. Evidently thus, this work brings promising aspects and underscores the potential of lightweight systems in delivering interpretable and efficient solutions for AD.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose the Momentum-Aware Driving (MomAD) framework, which introduces trajectory momentum and perception momentum to stabilize and refine trajectory predictions. MomAD comprises two core components: (1) Topological Trajectory Matching (TTM) employs Hausdorff Distance to select the optimal planning query that aligns with prior paths to ensure coherence;(2) Momentum Planning Interactor (MPI) cross-attends the selected planning query with historical queries to expand static and dynamic perception files. This enriched query, in turn, helps regenerate long-horizon trajectory and reduce collision risks. To mitigate noise arising from dynamic environments and detection errors, we introduce robust instance denoising during training, enabling the planning model to focus on critical signals and improve its robustness. We also propose a novel Trajectory Prediction Consistency (TPC) metric to quantitatively assess planning stability. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that MomAD achieves superior long-term consistency (>=3s) compared to SOTA methods. Moreover, evaluations on the curated Turning-nuScenes shows that MomAD reduces the collision rate by 26% and improves TPC by 0.97m (33.45%) over a 6s prediction horizon, while closedloop on Bench2Drive demonstrates an up to 16.3% improvement in success rate.</p></details> | 16 pages, 8 figures |

It autoaggressively performs scene understanding, danger level estimation and action decision. The predicted danger level reflects the risk of the potential action and provides an explicit reference for the final action, which corresponds to the preset personalized prompt. Moreover, we construct a closed-loop benchmark named PAD-Highway based on Highway-Env simulator to comprehensively evaluate the decision performance under traffic rules. The dataset contains 250 hours videos with high-quality annotation to facilitate the development of PAD behavior analysis. Experimental results on the constructed benchmark show that PADriver outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on different evaluation metrics, and enables various driving modes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive Personalized Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05223v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human drivers exhibit individual preferences regarding driving style. Adapting autonomous vehicles to these preferences is essential for user trust and satisfaction. However, existing end-to-end driving approaches often rely on predefined driving styles or require continuous user feedback for adaptation, limiting their ability to support dynamic, context-dependent preferences. We propose a novel approach using multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) with preference-driven optimization for end-to-end autonomous driving that enables runtime adaptation to driving style preferences. Preferences are encoded as continuous weight vectors to modulate behavior along interpretable style objectives$\unicode{x2013}$including efficiency, comfort, speed, and aggressiveness$\unicode{x2013}$without requiring policy retraining. Our single-policy agent integrates vision-based perception in complex mixed-traffic scenarios and is evaluated in diverse urban environments using the CARLA simulator. Experimental results demonstrate that the agent dynamically adapts its driving behavior according to changing preferences while maintaining performance in terms of collision avoidance and route completion.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce X-Driver, a unified multi-modal large language models(MLLMs) framework designed for closed-loop autonomous driving, leveraging Chain-of-Thought(CoT) and autoregressive modeling to enhance perception and decision-making. We validate X-Driver across multiple autonomous driving tasks using public benchmarks in CARLA simulation environment, including Bench2Drive[6]. Our experimental results demonstrate superior closed-loop performance, surpassing the current state-of-the-art(SOTA) while improving the interpretability of driving decisions. These findings underscore the importance of structured reasoning in end-to-end driving and establish X-Driver as a strong baseline for future research in closed-loop autonomous driving.</p></details> |  |

During heavy rainfall, the interference from raindrops can adversely affect the quality of LiDAR point clouds, resulting in, for instance, inaccurate point measurements. This, in turn, can potentially lead to safety concerns if autonomous driving systems are not weather-aware, i.e., if they are unable to discern such changes. In this study, we release a new, large-scale, multi-modal emulated rain dataset, REHEARSE-3D, to promote research advancements in 3D point cloud de-raining. Distinct from the most relevant competitors, our dataset is unique in several respects. First, it is the largest point-wise annotated dataset, and second, it is the only one with high-resolution LiDAR data (LiDAR-256) enriched with 4D Radar point clouds logged in both daytime and nighttime conditions in a controlled weather environment. Furthermore, REHEARSE-3D involves rain-characteristic information, which is of significant value not only for sensor noise modeling but also for analyzing the impact of weather at a point level. Leveraging REHEARSE-3D, we benchmark raindrop detection and removal in fused LiDAR and 4D Radar point clouds. Our comprehensive study further evaluates the performance of various statistical and deep-learning models.

Existing high-performing methods remain hard to deploy due to their high computational cost, long training times, and excessive memory requirements. Here, we propose an efficient lane-changing intention prediction approach based on brain-inspired Spiking Neural Networks (SNN). By leveraging the event-driven nature of SNN, the proposed approach enables us to encode the vehicle's states in a more efficient manner. Comparison experiments conducted on HighD and NGSIM datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves training efficiency and reduces deployment costs while maintaining comparable prediction accuracy. Particularly, compared to the baseline, our approach reduces training time by 75% and memory usage by 99.9%. These results validate the efficiency and reliability of our method in lane-changing predictions, highlighting its potential for safe and efficient autonomous driving systems while offering significant advantages in deployment, including reduced training time, lower memory usage, and faster inference.</p></details> |  |

LVLMs excel at high-level task planning across diverse driving scenarios. However, since these foundation models are not specifically designed for driving and their reasoning is not consistent with the feasibility of low-level motion planning, concerns remain regarding safety and smooth task switching. This paper integrates LVLMs with MPC Builder, which automatically generates MPCs on demand, based on symbolic task commands generated by the LVLM, while ensuring optimality and safety. The generated MPCs can strongly assist the execution or rejection of LVLM-driven task switching by providing feedback on the feasibility of the given tasks and generating task-switching-aware MPCs. Our approach provides a safe, flexible, and adaptable control framework, bridging the gap between cutting-edge foundation models and reliable vehicle operation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a simulation experiment, showing that our system can safely and effectively handle highway driving while maintaining the flexibility and adaptability of LVLMs.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |

However, when faced with severe illumination degradation in visible images, the fusion results of existing image fusion methods often exhibit blurry and dim visual effects, posing major challenges for autonomous driving. To this end, a Darkness-Free network is proposed to handle Visible and infrared image disentanglement and fusion all at Once (DFVO), which employs a cascaded multi-task approach to replace the traditional two-stage cascaded training (enhancement and fusion), addressing the issue of information entropy loss caused by hierarchical data transmission. Specifically, we construct a latent-common feature extractor (LCFE) to obtain latent features for the cascaded tasks strategy. Firstly, a details-extraction module (DEM) is devised to acquire high-frequency semantic information. Secondly, we design a hyper cross-attention module (HCAM) to extract low-frequency information and preserve texture features from source images. Finally, a relevant loss function is designed to guide the holistic network learning, thereby achieving better image fusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives in terms of qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Particularly, DFVO can generate clearer, more informative, and more evenly illuminated fusion results in the dark environments, achieving best performance on the LLVIP dataset with 63.258 dB PSNR and 0.724 CC, providing more effective information for high-level vision tasks. Our code is publicly accessible at https://github.com/DaVin-Qi530/DFVO.</p></details> |  |

This requires the generation of safety-critical scenarios that extend beyond the limitations of real-world data collection, as many of these scenarios are rare or rarely encountered on public roads. However, evaluating most existing novel view synthesis (NVS) methods relies on sporadic sampling of image frames from the training data, comparing the rendered images with ground-truth images. Unfortunately, this evaluation protocol falls short of meeting the actual requirements in closed-loop simulations. Specifically, the true application demands the capability to render novel views that extend beyond the original trajectory (such as cross-lane views), which are challenging to capture in the real world. To address this, this paper presents a synthetic dataset for novel driving view synthesis evaluation, which is specifically designed for autonomous driving simulations. This unique dataset includes testing images captured by deviating from the training trajectory by $1-4$ meters. It comprises six sequences that cover various times and weather conditions. Each sequence contains $450$ training images, $120$ testing images, and their corresponding camera poses and intrinsic parameters. Leveraging this novel dataset, we establish the first realistic benchmark for evaluating existing NVS approaches under front-only and multicamera settings. The experimental findings underscore the significant gap in current approaches, revealing their inadequate ability to fulfill the demanding prerequisites of cross-lane or closed-loop simulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to 3DV 2025, project page: https://3d-aigc.github.io/XLD/</p></details> |

At the cost of ever-increasing computational load and sensor complexity, odometry algorithms have reached impressive levels of accuracy with minimal drift in various conditions. In this paper, we question the need for more research on odometry for autonomous driving by assessing the accuracy of one of the simplest algorithms: the direct integration of wheel encoder data and yaw rate measurements from a gyroscope. We denote this algorithm as Odometer-Gyroscope (OG) odometry. This work shows that OG odometry can outperform current state-of-the-art radar-inertial SE(2) odometry for a fraction of the computational cost in most scenarios. For example, the OG odometry is on top of the Boreas leaderboard with a relative translation error of 0.20%, while the second-best method displays an error of 0.26%. Lidar-inertial approaches can provide more accurate estimates, but the computational load is three orders of magnitude higher than the OG odometry. To further the analysis, we have pushed the limits of the OG odometry by purposely violating its fundamental no-slip assumption using data collected during a heavy snowstorm with different driving behaviours. Our conclusion shows that a significant amount of slippage is required to result in non-satisfactory pose estimates from the OG odometry.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICRA ...</summary><p>ICRA 2025, Field Robotics workshop</p></details> |
| **[Predicting Road Surface Anomalies by Visual Tracking of a Preceding Vehicle](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04392v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A novel approach to detect road surface anomalies by visual tracking of a preceding vehicle is proposed. The method is versatile, predicting any kind of road anomalies, such as potholes, bumps, debris, etc., unlike direct observation methods that rely on training visual detectors of those cases. The method operates in low visibility conditions or in dense traffic where the anomaly is occluded by a preceding vehicle. Anomalies are detected predictively, i.e., before a vehicle encounters them, which allows to pre-configure low-level vehicle systems (such as chassis) or to plan an avoidance maneuver in case of autonomous driving. A challenge is that the signal coming from camera-based tracking of a preceding vehicle may be weak and disturbed by camera ego motion due to vibrations affecting the ego vehicle. Therefore, we propose an efficient method to compensate camera pitch rotation by an iterative robust estimator. Our experiments on both controlled setup and normal traffic conditions show that road anomalies can be detected reliably at a distance even in challenging cases where the ego vehicle traverses imperfect road surfaces. The method is effective and performs in real time on standard consumer hardware.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV), 2025</p></details> |
| **[Verification of Digital Twins using Classical and Statistical Model Checking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04322v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing adoption of digital techniques, the concept of digital twin (DT) has received a widespread attention in both industry and academia. While several definitions exist for a DT, most definitions focus on the existence of a virtual entity (VE) of a real-world object or process, often comprising interconnected models which interact with each other, undergoing changes continuously owing to the synchronization with the real-world object. These interactions might lead to inconsistencies at execution time, due to their highly stochastic and/or time-critical nature, which may lead to undesirable behavior. In addition, the continuously varying nature of VE owing to its synchronization with the real-world object further contributes to the complexity arising from these interactions and corresponding model execution times, which could possibly affect its overall functioning at runtime. This creates a need to perform (continuous) verification of the VE, to ensure that it behaves consistently at runtime by adhering to desired properties such as deadlock freeness, functional correctness, liveness and timeliness. Some critical properties such as deadlock freeness can only be verified using classical model checking; on the other hand, statistical model checking provides the possibility to model actual stochastic temporal behavior. We therefore propose to use both these techniques to verify the correctness and the fulfillment of desirable properties of VE. We present our observations and findings from applying these techniques on the DT of an autonomously driving truck. Results from these verification techniques suggest that this DT adheres to properties of deadlock freeness and functional correctness, but not adhering to timeliness properties.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings ASQAP 2025, arXiv:2505.02873</p></details> |

This paper proposes a novel roadside unit (RSU)-centric cooperative driving system leveraging global perception and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication. The core of the system is an RSU-based decision-making module using a two-stage hybrid reinforcement learning (RL) framework. At first, policies are pre-trained offline using conservative Q-learning (CQL) combined with behavior cloning (BC) on collected dataset. Subsequently, these policies are fine-tuned in the simulation using multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO), aligned with a self-attention mechanism to effectively solve inter-agent dependencies. RSUs perform real-time inference based on the trained models to realize vehicle control via V2I communications. Extensive experiments in CARLA environment demonstrate high effectiveness of the proposed system, by: \textit{(i)} achieving failure rates below 0.03\% in coordinating three connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) through complex intersection scenarios, significantly outperforming the traditional Autoware control method, and \textit{(ii)} exhibiting strong robustness across varying numbers of controlled agents and shows promising generalization capabilities on other maps.</p></details> | 7 pages |
| **[LRFusionPR: A Polar BEV-Based LiDAR-Radar Fusion Network for Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19186v2)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In autonomous driving, place recognition is critical for global localization in GPS-denied environments. LiDAR and radar-based place recognition methods have garnered increasing attention, as LiDAR provides precise ranging, whereas radar excels in adverse weather resilience. However, effectively leveraging LiDAR-radar fusion for place recognition remains challenging. The noisy and sparse nature of radar data limits its potential to further improve recognition accuracy. In addition, heterogeneous radar configurations complicate the development of unified cross-modality fusion frameworks. In this paper, we propose LRFusionPR, which improves recognition accuracy and robustness by fusing LiDAR with either single-chip or scanning radar. Technically, a dual-branch network is proposed to fuse different modalities within the unified polar coordinate bird's eye view (BEV) representation. In the fusion branch, cross-attention is utilized to perform cross-modality feature interactions. The knowledge from the fusion branch is simultaneously transferred to the distillation branch, which takes radar as its only input to further improve the robustness. Ultimately, the descriptors from both branches are concatenated, producing the multimodal global descriptor for place retrieval. Extensive evaluations on multiple datasets demonstrate that our LRFusionPR achieves accurate place recognition, while maintaining robustness under varying weather conditions. Our open-source code will be released at https://github.com/QiZS-BIT/LRFusionPR.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |

Parsing these scenes into semantic triplets <Subject-Predicate-Object> for accurate Scene Graph Generation (SGG) is highly challenging due to the fluctuating spatio-temporal complexity. Inspired by the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose SceneLLM, a novel framework that leverages LLMs as powerful scene analyzers for dynamic SGG. Our framework introduces a Video-to-Language (V2L) mapping module that transforms video frames into linguistic signals (scene tokens), making the input more comprehensible for LLMs. To better encode spatial information, we devise a Spatial Information Aggregation (SIA) scheme, inspired by the structure of Chinese characters, which encodes spatial data into tokens. Using Optimal Transport (OT), we generate an implicit language signal from the frame-level token sequence that captures the video's spatio-temporal information. To further improve the LLM's ability to process this implicit linguistic input, we apply Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune the model. Finally, we use a transformer-based SGG predictor to decode the LLM's reasoning and predict semantic triplets. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on the Action Genome (AG) benchmark, and extensive experiments show the effectiveness of SceneLLM in understanding and generating accurate dynamic scene graphs.</p></details> | 29 pages, 7 figures |

The extension of this technique to the physical world is crucial for testing the robustness of autonomous driving systems. However, existing methods do not show good performances when applied to the physical world. This is partly due to insufficient photorealism in training examples, and lack of proper physical realization methods for camouflage. To generate a robust adversarial camouflage suitable for real vehicles, we propose a novel method called PAV-Camou. We propose to adjust the mapping from the coordinates in the 2D map to those of corresponding 3D model. This process is critical for mitigating texture distortion and ensuring the camouflage's effectiveness when applied in the real world. Then we combine two renderers with different characteristics to obtain adversarial examples that are photorealistic that closely mimic real-world lighting and texture properties. The method ensures that the generated textures remain effective under diverse environmental conditions. Our adversarial camouflage can be optimized and printed in the form of 2D patterns, allowing for direct application on real vehicles. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our proposed method achieved good performance in both the digital world and the physical world.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 15 figures; this paper has been accepted by IEEE/CAA Journal of Automatica Sinica</p></details> |

Existing trusted multi-view learning methods implicitly assume that multi-view data is secure. In practice, however, in safety-sensitive applications such as autonomous driving and security monitoring, multi-view data often faces threats from adversarial perturbations, thereby deceiving or disrupting multi-view learning models. This inevitably leads to the adversarial unreliability problem (AUP) in trusted multi-view learning. To overcome this tricky problem, we propose a novel multi-view learning framework, namely Reliable Disentanglement Multi-view Learning (RDML). Specifically, we first propose evidential disentanglement learning to decompose each view into clean and adversarial parts under the guidance of corresponding evidences, which is extracted by a pretrained evidence extractor. Then, we employ the feature recalibration module to mitigate the negative impact of adversarial perturbations and extract potential informative features from them. Finally, to further ignore the irreparable adversarial interferences, a view-level evidential attention mechanism is designed. Extensive experiments on multi-view classification tasks with adversarial attacks show that our RDML outperforms the state-of-the-art multi-view learning methods by a relatively large margin.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 11 figures, accepted by International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI 2025)</p></details> |

While a global route can be pre-computed offline, real-time generation of adaptive local paths remains crucial. Therefore, we present the Frenet Corridor Planner (FCP), an optimization-based local path planning strategy for autonomous driving that ensures smooth and safe navigation around obstacles. Modeling the vehicles as safety-augmented bounding boxes and pedestrians as convex hulls in the Frenet space, our approach defines a drivable corridor by determining the appropriate deviation side for static obstacles. Thereafter, a modified space-domain bicycle kinematics model enables path optimization for smoothness, boundary clearance, and dynamic obstacle risk minimization. The optimized path is then passed to a speed planner to generate the final trajectory. We validate FCP through extensive simulations and real-world hardware experiments, demonstrating its efficiency and effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 10 figures - Presented at 2025 IEEE 36th Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)</p></details> |
| **[Moral Testing of Autonomous Driving Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03683v1)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous Driving System (ADS) testing plays a crucial role in their development, with the current focus primarily on functional and safety testing. However, evaluating the non-functional morality of ADSs, particularly their decision-making capabilities in unavoidable collision scenarios, is equally important to ensure the systems' trustworthiness and public acceptance. Unfortunately, testing ADS morality is nearly impossible due to the absence of universal moral principles. To address this challenge, this paper first extracts a set of moral meta-principles derived from existing moral experiments and well-established social science theories, aiming to capture widely recognized and common-sense moral values for ADSs. These meta-principles are then formalized as quantitative moral metamorphic relations, which act as the test oracle. Furthermore, we propose a metamorphic testing framework to systematically identify potential moral issues. Finally, we illustrate the implementation of the framework and present typical violation cases using the VIRES VTD simulator and its built-in ADS.</p></details> |  |

Although camera sensors provide rich visual details, they are vulnerable to adverse weather conditions. In contrast, radar sensors remain robust under such conditions, but often produce sparse and noisy data. Therefore, a promising approach is to fuse information from both sensors. In this work, we propose a novel framework to enhance camera-only baselines by integrating a diffusion model into a camera-radar fusion architecture. We leverage radar point features to create pseudo-masks using the Segment-Anything model, treating the projected radar points as point prompts. Additionally, we propose a noise reduction unit to denoise these pseudo-masks, which are further used to generate inpainted images that complete the missing information in the original images. Our method improves the camera-only segmentation baseline by 2.63% in mIoU and enhances our camera-radar fusion architecture by 1.48% in mIoU on the Waterscenes dataset. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach for semantic segmentation using camera-radar fusion under adverse weather conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at RA-L 2025</p></details> |

Transformer-based architectures have demonstrated significant promise in capturing complex spatio-temporality dependencies. However, their reliance on normalization layers can lead to computation overhead and training instabilities. In this work, we present a two-fold approach to address these challenges. First, we integrate DynamicTanh (DyT), which is the latest method to promote transformers, into the backbone, replacing traditional layer normalization. This modification simplifies the network architecture and improves the stability of the inference. We are the first work to deploy the DyT to the trajectory prediction task. Complementing this, we employ a snapshot ensemble strategy to further boost trajectory prediction performance. Using cyclical learning rate scheduling, multiple model snapshots are captured during a single training run. These snapshots are then aggregated via simple averaging at inference time, allowing the model to benefit from diverse hypotheses without incurring substantial additional computational cost. Extensive experiments on Argoverse datasets demonstrate that our combined approach significantly improves prediction accuracy, inference speed and robustness in diverse driving scenarios. This work underscores the potential of normalization-free transformer designs augmented with lightweight ensemble techniques in advancing trajectory forecasting for autonomous vehicles.</p></details> |  |
| **[Coop-WD: Cooperative Perception with Weighting and Denoising for Robust V2V Communication](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03528v1)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cooperative perception, leveraging shared information from multiple vehicles via vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication, plays a vital role in autonomous driving to alleviate the limitation of single-vehicle perception. Existing works have explored the effects of V2V communication impairments on perception precision, but they lack generalization to different levels of impairments. In this work, we propose a joint weighting and denoising framework, Coop-WD, to enhance cooperative perception subject to V2V channel impairments. In this framework, the self-supervised contrastive model and the conditional diffusion probabilistic model are adopted hierarchically for vehicle-level and pixel-level feature enhancement. An efficient variant model, Coop-WD-eco, is proposed to selectively deactivate denoising to reduce processing overhead. Rician fading, non-stationarity, and time-varying distortion are considered. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed Coop-WD outperforms conventional benchmarks in all types of channels. Qualitative analysis with visual examples further proves the superiority of our proposed method. The proposed Coop-WD-eco achieves up to 50% reduction in computational cost under severe distortion while maintaining comparable accuracy as channel conditions improve.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in dataflow-based CNN accelerators have enabled CNN inference in resource-constrained edge devices. These dataflow accelerators utilize inherent data reuse of convolution layers to process CNN models efficiently. Concealing the architecture of CNN models is critical for privacy and security. This article evaluates memory-based side-channel information to recover CNN architectures from dataflow-based CNN inference accelerators. The proposed attack exploits spatial and temporal data reuse of the dataflow mapping on CNN accelerators and architectural hints to recover the structure of CNN models. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed side-channel attack can recover the structures of popular CNN models, namely, Lenet, Alexnet, VGGnet16, and YOLOv2.</p></details> |  |

Data-driven simulation methods reproduce realistic trajectories but suffer from covariate shift in closed-loop deployment, compounded by simplified dynamics models that further reduce reliability. Conversely, physics-based simulation methods enhance reliable and controllable closed-loop interactions but often lack expert demonstrations, compromising realism. To address these challenges, we introduce a dual-stage AV-centered simulation framework that conducts open-loop imitation learning pre-training in a data-driven simulator to capture trajectory-level realism and multimodality, followed by closed-loop reinforcement learning fine-tuning in a physics-based simulator to enhance controllability and mitigate covariate shift. In the fine-tuning stage, we propose RIFT, a simple yet effective closed-loop RL fine-tuning strategy that preserves the trajectory-level multimodality through a GRPO-style group-relative advantage formulation, while enhancing controllability and training stability by replacing KL regularization with the dual-clip mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RIFT significantly improves the realism and controllability of generated traffic scenarios, providing a robust platform for evaluating autonomous vehicle performance in diverse and interactive scenarios.</p></details> |  |

This paper defines the technical framework of Artificial Behavior Intelligence (ABI), which comprehensively analyzes and interprets human posture, facial expressions, emotions, behavioral sequences, and contextual cues. It details the essential components of ABI, including pose estimation, face and emotion recognition, sequential behavior analysis, and context-aware modeling.

We introduce a new 3D semantic segmentation pipeline that leverages aligned scenes and state-of-the-art 2D segmentation methods, avoiding the need for direct 3D annotation or reliance on additional modalities such as camera images at inference time. Our approach generates 2D views from LiDAR scans colored by sensor intensity and applies 2D semantic segmentation to these views using a camera-domain pretrained model. The segmented 2D outputs are then back-projected onto the 3D points, with a simple voting-based estimator that merges the labels associated to each 3D point. Our main contribution is a global pipeline for 3D semantic segmentation requiring no prior 3D annotation and not other modality for inference, which can be used for pseudo-label generation. We conduct a thorough ablation study and demonstrate the potential of the generated pseudo-labels for the Unsupervised Domain Adaptation task.</p></details> | Accepted to IV2024 |
| **[RobotxR1: Enabling Embodied Robotic Intelligence on Large Language Models through Closed-Loop Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03238v1)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Future robotic systems operating in real-world environments will require on-board embodied intelligence without continuous cloud connection, balancing capabilities with constraints on computational power and memory. This work presents an extension of the R1-zero approach, which enables the usage of low parameter-count Large Language Models (LLMs) in the robotic domain. The R1-Zero approach was originally developed to enable mathematical reasoning in LLMs using static datasets. We extend it to the robotics domain through integration in a closed-loop Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework. This extension enhances reasoning in Embodied Artificial Intelligence (Embodied AI) settings without relying solely on distillation of large models through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). We show that small-scale LLMs can achieve effective reasoning performance by learning through closed-loop interaction with their environment, which enables tasks that previously required significantly larger models. In an autonomous driving setting, a performance gain of 20.2%-points over the SFT-based baseline is observed with a Qwen2.5-1.5B model. Using the proposed training procedure, Qwen2.5-3B achieves a 63.3% control adaptability score, surpassing the 58.5% obtained by the much larger, cloud-bound GPT-4o. These results highlight that practical, on-board deployment of small LLMs is not only feasible but can outperform larger models if trained through environmental feedback, underscoring the importance of an interactive learning framework for robotic Embodied AI, one grounded in practical experience rather than static supervision.</p></details> |  |

The evaluation of machine learning models often focuses on data slices, which are subsets of the data that share a set of characteristics. Data slice finding automatically identifies conditions or data subgroups where models underperform, aiding developers in mitigating performance issues. Despite its popularity and effectiveness, data slicing for vision model validation faces several challenges. First, data slicing often needs additional image metadata or visual concepts, and falls short in certain computer vision tasks, such as object detection. Second, understanding data slices is a labor-intensive and mentally demanding process that heavily relies on the expert's domain knowledge. Third, data slicing lacks a human-in-the-loop solution that allows experts to form hypothesis and test them interactively. To overcome these limitations and better support the machine learning operations lifecycle, we introduce VISLIX, a novel visual analytics framework that employs state-of-the-art foundation models to help domain experts analyze slices in computer vision models. Our approach does not require image metadata or visual concepts, automatically generates natural language insights, and allows users to test data slice hypothesis interactively. We evaluate VISLIX with an expert study and three use cases, that demonstrate the effectiveness of our tool in providing comprehensive insights for validating object detection models.</p></details> |  |

Existing LiDAR-camera calibration methods often rely on manually placed targets, preliminary parameter estimates, or intensive data preprocessing, limiting their scalability and adaptability in real-world settings. In this work, we propose a fully automatic, targetless, and online calibration framework, CalibRefine, which directly processes raw LiDAR point clouds and camera images. Our approach is divided into four stages: (1) a Common Feature Discriminator that leverages relative spatial positions, visual appearance embeddings, and semantic class cues to identify and generate reliable LiDAR-camera correspondences, (2) a coarse homography-based calibration that uses the matched feature correspondences to estimate an initial transformation between the LiDAR and camera frames, serving as the foundation for further refinement, (3) an iterative refinement to incrementally improve alignment as additional data frames become available, and (4) an attention-based refinement that addresses non-planar distortions by leveraging a Vision Transformer and cross-attention mechanisms. Extensive experiments on two urban traffic datasets demonstrate that CalibRefine achieves high-precision calibration with minimal human input, outperforming state-of-the-art targetless methods and matching or surpassing manually tuned baselines. Our results show that robust object-level feature matching, combined with iterative refinement and self-supervised attention-based refinement, enables reliable sensor alignment in complex real-world conditions without ground-truth matrices or elaborate preprocessing.

In this paper, we introduce HeAL (Heuristical-enhanced Active Learning for 3D Object Detection) which integrates those heuristical features together with Localization and Classification to deliver the most contributing samples to the model's training. In contrast to previous works, our approach integrates heuristical features such as object distance and point-quantity to estimate the uncertainty, which enhance the usefulness of selected samples to train detection models. Our quantitative evaluation on KITTI shows that HeAL presents competitive mAP with respect to the State-of-the-Art, and achieves the same mAP as the full-supervised baseline with only 24% of the samples.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in CVPRw2025</p></details> |

However, current multi-modal scene understanding approaches have naively embedded semantic representations into 3D reconstruction methods without striking a balance between visual and language modalities, which leads to unsatisfying semantic rasterization of translucent or reflective objects, as well as over-fitting on color modality. To alleviate these limitations, we propose a solution that adequately handles the distinct visual and semantic modalities, i.e., a 3D vision-language Gaussian splatting model for scene understanding, to put emphasis on the representation learning of language modality. We propose a novel cross-modal rasterizer, using modality fusion along with a smoothed semantic indicator for enhancing semantic rasterization. We also employ a camera-view blending technique to improve semantic consistency between existing and synthesized views, thereby effectively mitigating over-fitting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, surpassing existing methods by a significant margin.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025.

| **[Vision-based 3D Semantic Scene Completion via Capture Dynamic Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06222v2)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The vision-based semantic scene completion task aims to predict dense geometric and semantic 3D scene representations from 2D images. However, the presence of dynamic objects in the scene seriously affects the accuracy of the model inferring 3D structures from 2D images. Existing methods simply stack multiple frames of image input to increase dense scene semantic information, but ignore the fact that dynamic objects and non-texture areas violate multi-view consistency and matching reliability. To address these issues, we propose a novel method, CDScene: Vision-based Robust Semantic Scene Completion via Capturing Dynamic Representations. First, we leverage a multimodal large-scale model to extract 2D explicit semantics and align them into 3D space. Second, we exploit the characteristics of monocular and stereo depth to decouple scene information into dynamic and static features. The dynamic features contain structural relationships around dynamic objects, and the static features contain dense contextual spatial information. Finally, we design a dynamic-static adaptive fusion module to effectively extract and aggregate complementary features, achieving robust and accurate semantic scene completion in autonomous driving scenarios. Extensive experimental results on the SemanticKITTI, SSCBench-KITTI360, and SemanticKITTI-C datasets demonstrate the superiority and robustness of CDScene over existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Our framework edits real-world LiDAR scans by introducing new object layouts while preserving the realism of the background environment. Compared to end-to-end frameworks that generate LiDAR point clouds from scratch, LiDAR-EDIT offers users full control over the object layout, including the number, type, and pose of objects, while keeping most of the original real-world background. Our method also provides object labels for the generated data. Compared to novel view synthesis techniques, our framework allows for the creation of counterfactual scenarios with object layouts significantly different from the original real-world scene. LiDAR-EDIT uses spherical voxelization to enforce correct LiDAR projective geometry in the generated point clouds by construction. During object removal and insertion, generative models are employed to fill the unseen background and object parts that were occluded in the original real LiDAR scans. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework produces realistic LiDAR scans with practical value for downstream tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA). 6 pages, 7 figures</p></details> |

DriveAgent uniquely integrates diverse sensor modalities-including camera, LiDAR, GPS, and IMU-with LLM-driven analytical processes structured across specialized agents. The framework operates through a modular agent-based pipeline comprising four principal modules: (i) a descriptive analysis agent identifying critical sensor data events based on filtered timestamps, (ii) dedicated vehicle-level analysis conducted by LiDAR and vision agents that collaboratively assess vehicle conditions and movements, (iii) environmental reasoning and causal analysis agents explaining contextual changes and their underlying mechanisms, and (iv) an urgency-aware decision-generation agent prioritizing insights and proposing timely maneuvers. This modular design empowers the LLM to effectively coordinate specialized perception and reasoning agents, delivering cohesive, interpretable insights into complex autonomous driving scenarios. Extensive experiments on challenging autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that DriveAgent is achieving superior performance on multiple metrics against baseline methods. These results validate the efficacy of the proposed LLM-driven multi-agent sensor fusion framework, underscoring its potential to substantially enhance the robustness and reliability of autonomous driving systems.</p></details> |  |

Traditional modular methods suffer from error propagation, while existing end-to-end models typically employ static one-shot inference paradigms that inadequately capture the dynamic changes of the environment. ARTEMIS takes a different method by generating trajectory waypoints sequentially, preserves critical temporal dependencies while dynamically routing scene-specific queries to specialized expert networks. It effectively relieves trajectory quality degradation issues encountered when guidance information is ambiguous, and overcomes the inherent representational limitations of singular network architectures when processing diverse driving scenarios. Additionally, we use a lightweight batch reallocation strategy that significantly improves the training speed of the Mixture-of-Experts model. Through experiments on the NAVSIM dataset, ARTEMIS exhibits superior competitive performance, achieving 87.0 PDMS and 83.1 EPDMS with ResNet-34 backbone, demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on multiple metrics.</p></details> |  |

When designing robust computer vision systems, removing adverse weather such as haze, rain, and snow is a significant problem. Recently, deep-learning methods offered a solution for a single type of degradation. Current state-of-the-art universal methods struggle with combinations of degradations, such as haze and rain-streak. Few algorithms have been developed that perform well when presented with images containing multiple adverse weather conditions. This work focuses on developing an efficient solution for multiple adverse weather removal using a unified quaternion neural architecture called CMAWRNet. It is based on a novel texture-structure decomposition block, a novel lightweight encoder-decoder quaternion transformer architecture, and an attentive fusion block with low-light correction. We also introduce a quaternion similarity loss function to preserve color information better. The quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the current state-of-the-art benchmarking datasets and real-world images shows the performance advantages of the proposed CMAWRNet compared to other state-of-the-art weather removal approaches dealing with multiple weather artifacts. Extensive computer simulations validate that CMAWRNet improves the performance of downstream applications such as object detection. This is the first time the decomposition approach has been applied to the universal weather removal task.</p></details> |  |

A modified Adaptive Kalman Filter dynamically adjusts its noise parameters based on environmental context. It leverages several streams of raw sensor data along with semantic insights from models such as LLaMA 3.2 11B and BLIP-2. To evaluate our approach, we introduce the MD-NEX Benchmark, a novel multi-domain dataset that unifies indoor navigation, autonomous driving, and social navigation tasks with ground-truth actions and human-validated explanations. Extensive experiments and ablations show that PhysNav-DG improves navigation success rates by over 20% and achieves high efficiency, with explanations that are both highly grounded and clear.

However, existing approaches, which primarily use 3D bounding boxes and binary maps for foreground and background control, fall short in capturing the complexity of the scene and integrating multi-modal information. In this paper, we propose DualDiff, a dual-branch conditional diffusion model designed to enhance multi-view driving scene generation. We introduce Occupancy Ray Sampling (ORS), a semantic-rich 3D representation, alongside numerical driving scene representation, for comprehensive foreground and background control. To improve cross-modal information integration, we propose a Semantic Fusion Attention (SFA) mechanism that aligns and fuses features across modalities. Furthermore, we design a foreground-aware masked (FGM) loss to enhance the generation of tiny objects. DualDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance in FID score, as well as consistently better results in downstream BEV segmentation and 3D object detection tasks.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures, |

However, a key challenge remains: precise and flexible camera pose control, which is crucial for accurate viewpoint transformation and realistic simulation of scene dynamics. In this paper, we introduce PosePilot, a lightweight yet powerful framework that significantly enhances camera pose controllability in generative world models. Drawing inspiration from self-supervised depth estimation, PosePilot leverages structure-from-motion principles to establish a tight coupling between camera pose and video generation. Specifically, we incorporate self-supervised depth and pose readouts, allowing the model to infer depth and relative camera motion directly from video sequences. These outputs drive pose-aware frame warping, guided by a photometric warping loss that enforces geometric consistency across synthesized frames. To further refine camera pose estimation, we introduce a reverse warping step and a pose regression loss, improving viewpoint precision and adaptability. Extensive experiments on autonomous driving and general-domain video datasets demonstrate that PosePilot significantly enhances structural understanding and motion reasoning in both diffusion-based and auto-regressive world models. By steering camera pose with self-supervised depth, PosePilot sets a new benchmark for pose controllability, enabling physically consistent, reliable viewpoint synthesis in generative world models.</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Predictive Planner for Autonomous Driving with Consistency Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08033v2)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction and planning are essential for autonomous vehicles to navigate safely and efficiently in dynamic environments. Traditional approaches often treat them separately, limiting the ability for interactive planning. While recent diffusion-based generative models have shown promise in multi-agent trajectory generation, their slow sampling is less suitable for high-frequency planning tasks. In this paper, we leverage the consistency model to build a predictive planner that samples from a joint distribution of ego and surrounding agents, conditioned on the ego vehicle's navigational goal. Trained on real-world human driving datasets, our consistency model generates higher-quality trajectories with fewer sampling steps than standard diffusion models, making it more suitable for real-time deployment. To enforce multiple planning constraints simultaneously on the ego trajectory, a novel online guided sampling approach inspired by the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) is introduced. Evaluated on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD), our method enables proactive behavior such as nudging and yielding, and also demonstrates smoother, safer, and more efficient trajectories and satisfaction of multiple constraints under a limited computational budget.</p></details> |  |

A policy is trained to select and fix the gear positions across the prediction horizon of the MPC controller, leaving a significantly simpler continuous optimization problem to be solved online. In simulation, the proposed approach is shown to have a significantly lower computation burden and a comparable performance, with respect to pure MPC-based co-optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 3 figures, submitted to L-CSS.

However, existing depth estimation algorithms often struggle to effectively balance performance and computational efficiency, which poses challenges for deployment on resource-constrained devices. To address this, we propose LMDepth, a lightweight Mamba-based monocular depth estimation network, designed to reconstruct high-precision depth information while maintaining low computational overhead. Specifically, we propose a modified pyramid spatial pooling module that serves as a multi-scale feature aggregator and context extractor, ensuring global spatial information for accurate depth estimation. Moreover, we integrate multiple depth Mamba blocks into the decoder. Designed with linear computations, the Mamba Blocks enable LMDepth to efficiently decode depth information from global features, providing a lightweight alternative to Transformer-based architectures that depend on complex attention mechanisms. Extensive experiments on the NYUDv2 and KITTI datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed LMDepth. Compared to previous lightweight depth estimation methods, LMDepth achieves higher performance with fewer parameters and lower computational complexity (measured by GFLOPs). We further deploy LMDepth on an embedded platform with INT8 quantization, validating its practicality for real-world edge applications.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce an online, retrieval-augmented large language model (LLM) framework for generating safety-critical driving scenarios. Our method first employs an LLM-based behavior analyzer to infer the most dangerous intent of the background vehicle from the observed state, then queries additional LLM agents to synthesize feasible adversarial trajectories. To mitigate catastrophic forgetting and accelerate adaptation, we augment the framework with a dynamic memorization and retrieval bank of intent-planner pairs, automatically expanding its behavioral library when novel intents arise. Evaluations using the Waymo Open Motion Dataset demonstrate that our model reduces the mean minimum time-to-collision from 1.62 to 1.08 s and incurs a 75% collision rate, substantially outperforming baselines.</p></details> |  |

Learning from expert data can be achieved through behavioral cloning or by learning a reward function, i.e., inverse reinforcement learning. The latter allows for training with additional data outside the training distribution, guided by the inferred reward function. We propose a novel approach to construct compact and transparent reward models from automatically selected state features. These inferred rewards have an explicit form and enable the learning of policies that closely match expert behavior by training standard reinforcement learning algorithms from scratch.

However, this increased interconnectivity introduces new security vulnerabilities. Bot malware and cyberattacks pose significant risks to Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs), as demonstrated by real-world incidents involving remote vehicle system compromise. To address these challenges, we propose an edge-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that monitors network traffic to and from CAVs. Our detection model is based on a meta-ensemble classifier capable of recognizing known (Nday) attacks and detecting previously unseen (zero-day) attacks. The approach involves training multiple Isolation Forest (IF) models on Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) servers, with each IF specialized in identifying a specific type of botnet attack. These IFs, either trained locally or shared by other MEC nodes, are then aggregated using a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) based stacking strategy to construct a robust meta-classifier. The proposed IDS has been evaluated on a vehicular botnet dataset, achieving an average detection rate of 92.80% for N-day attacks and 77.32% for zero-day attacks. These results highlight the effectiveness of our solution in detecting both known and emerging threats, providing a scalable and adaptive defense mechanism for CAVs within the IoV ecosystem.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches often generate unrealistic scenarios due to insufficient consideration of physical plausibility and suffer from low generation efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose a guided latent diffusion model (LDM) capable of generating physically realistic and adversarial safety-critical traffic scenarios. Specifically, our model employs a graph-based variational autoencoder (VAE) to learn a compact latent space that captures complex multi-agent interactions while improving computational efficiency. Within this latent space, the diffusion model performs the denoising process to produce realistic trajectories. To enable controllable and adversarial scenario generation, we introduce novel guidance objectives that drive the diffusion process toward producing adversarial and behaviorally realistic driving behaviors. Furthermore, we develop a sample selection module based on physical feasibility checks to further enhance the physical plausibility of the generated scenarios. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that our method achieves superior adversarial effectiveness and generation efficiency compared to existing baselines while maintaining a high level of realism. Our work provides an effective tool for realistic safety-critical scenario simulation, paving the way for more robust evaluation of autonomous driving systems.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures |

To practically deploy such technologies, it is essential to achieve real-time processing within low-power embedded environments. Addressing this, we present the first on-chip implementation of a 4D radar-based 3D object detection model on the Hailo-8L AI accelerator. Although conventional 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures require 5D inputs, the Hailo-8L only supports 4D tensors, posing a significant challenge. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a tensor transformation method that reshapes 5D inputs into 4D formats during the compilation process, enabling direct deployment without altering the model structure. The proposed system achieves 46.47% AP_3D and 52.75% AP_BEV, maintaining comparable accuracy to GPU-based models while achieving an inference speed of 13.76 Hz. These results demonstrate the applicability of 4D radar-based perception technologies to autonomous driving systems.</p></details> | 4pages, 2 figures |

DL model performance heavily relies on network depth. Specifically, deeper DL architectures yield better segmentation performance. However, as models grow deeper, traditional one-point supervision at the final layer struggles to optimize intermediate feature representations, leading to subpar training outcomes. To address this, we propose an intermediate Multi-access Supervision and Regularization (iMacSR) strategy. The proposed iMacSR introduces two novel components: (I) mutual information between latent features and ground truth as intermediate supervision loss ensures robust feature alignment at multiple network depths; and (II) negative entropy regularization on hidden features discourages overconfident predictions and mitigates overfitting. These intermediate terms are combined into the original final-layer training loss to form a unified optimization objective, enabling comprehensive optimization across the network hierarchy. The proposed iMacSR provides a robust framework for training deep AD architectures, advancing the performance of perception systems in real-world driving scenarios. In addition, we conduct theoretical convergence analysis for the proposed iMacSR. Extensive experiments on AD benchmarks (i.e., Cityscapes, CamVid, and SynthiaSF datasets) demonstrate that iMacSR outperforms conventional final-layer single-point supervision method up to 9.19% in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU).</p></details> | 8 pages |

Their inference models typically face poor generalization due to domain-shift. Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for enhancing the generalization of AD models through privacy-preserving distributed learning. However, these FL AD models face significant temporal catastrophic forgetting when deployed in dynamically evolving environments, where continuous adaptation causes abrupt erosion of historical knowledge. This paper proposes Federated Exponential Moving Average (FedEMA), a novel framework that addresses this challenge through two integral innovations: (I) Server-side model's historical fitting capability preservation via fusing current FL round's aggregation model and a proposed previous FL round's exponential moving average (EMA) model; (II) Vehicle-side negative entropy regularization to prevent FL models' possible overfitting to EMA-introduced temporal patterns. Above two strategies empower FedEMA a dual-objective optimization that balances model generalization and adaptability. In addition, we conduct theoretical convergence analysis for the proposed FedEMA. Extensive experiments both on Cityscapes dataset and Camvid dataset demonstrate FedEMA's superiority over existing approaches, showing 7.12% higher mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU).</p></details> | 8 pages |

State-of-the-art motion planners are trained on meticulously curated datasets, which are not only expensive to annotate but also insufficient in capturing rarely seen critical scenarios. Failing to account for such scenarios poses a significant risk to motion planners and may lead to incidents during testing. An intuitive solution is to manually compose such scenarios by programming and executing a simulator (e.g., CARLA). However, this approach incurs substantial human costs. Motivated by this, we propose an inexpensive method for generating diverse critical traffic scenarios to train more robust motion planners. First, we represent traffic scenarios as scripts, which are then used by the simulator to generate traffic scenarios. Next, we develop a method that accepts user-specified text descriptions, which a Large Language Model translates into scripts using in-context learning. The output scripts are sent to the simulator that produces the corresponding traffic scenarios. As our method can generate abundant safety-critical traffic scenarios, we use them as synthetic training data for motion planners. To demonstrate the value of generated scenarios, we train existing motion planners on our synthetic data, real-world datasets, and a combination of both. Our experiments show that motion planners trained with our data significantly outperform those trained solely on real-world data, showing the usefulness of our synthetic data and the effectiveness of our data generation method.

A world model is a neural network capable of predicting an agent's next state given past states and actions. By leveraging a world model during training, the driving policy effectively mitigates covariate shift without requiring an excessive amount of training data. During end-to-end training, our policy learns how to recover from errors by aligning with states observed in human demonstrations, so that at runtime it can recover from perturbations outside the training distribution. Additionally, we introduce a novel transformer-based perception encoder that employs multi-view cross-attention and a learned scene query. We present qualitative and quantitative results, demonstrating significant improvements upon prior state of the art in closed-loop testing in the CARLA simulator, as well as showing the ability to handle perturbations in both CARLA and NVIDIA's DRIVE Sim.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, updated in March 2025, original published in September 2024, for ICRA 2025 submission, for associated video file, see https://youtu.be/7m3bXzlVQvU</p></details> |

However, in the context of autonomous driving, their limited comprehension of 3D environments restricts their effectiveness in achieving a complete and safe understanding of dynamic surroundings. To address this, we introduce V3LMA, a novel approach that enhances 3D scene understanding by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with LVLMs. V3LMA leverages textual descriptions generated from object detections and video inputs, significantly boosting performance without requiring fine-tuning. Through a dedicated preprocessing pipeline that extracts 3D object data, our method improves situational awareness and decision-making in complex traffic scenarios, achieving a score of 0.56 on the LingoQA benchmark. We further explore different fusion strategies and token combinations with the goal of advancing the interpretation of traffic scenes, ultimately enabling safer autonomous driving systems.</p></details> |  |

State-of-the-art motion forecasting models rely on large curated datasets with manually annotated or heavily post-processed trajectories. However, building these datasets is costly, generally manual, hard to scale, and lacks reproducibility. They also introduce domain gaps that limit generalization across environments. We introduce PPT (Pretraining with Pseudo-labeled Trajectories), a simple and scalable alternative that uses unprocessed and diverse trajectories automatically generated from off-the-shelf 3D detectors and tracking. Unlike traditional pipelines aiming for clean, single-label annotations, PPT embraces noise and diversity as useful signals for learning robust representations. With optional finetuning on a small amount of labeled data, models pretrained with PPT achieve strong performance across standard benchmarks particularly in low-data regimes, and in cross-domain, end-to-end and multi-class settings. PPT is easy to implement and improves generalization in motion forecasting.

However, removing all temporarily static objects, such as stopped vehicles and standing pedestrians, presents a significant challenge. Unlike object-centric 3D inpainting, which relies on thorough observation in a small scene, street scene cases involve long trajectories that differ from previous 3D inpainting tasks. The camera-centric moving environment of captured videos further complicates the task due to the limited degree and time duration of object observation. To address these obstacles, we introduce StreetUnveiler to reconstruct an empty street. StreetUnveiler learns a 3D representation of the empty street from crowded observations. Our representation is based on the hard-label semantic 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) for its scalability and ability to identify Gaussians to be removed. We inpaint rendered image after removing unwanted Gaussians to provide pseudo-labels and subsequently re-optimize the 2DGS. Given its temporal continuous movement, we divide the empty street scene into observed, partial-observed, and unobserved regions, which we propose to locate through a rendered alpha map. This decomposition helps us to minimize the regions that need to be inpainted. To enhance the temporal consistency of the inpainting, we introduce a novel time-reversal framework to inpaint frames in reverse order and use later frames as references for earlier frames to fully utilize the long-trajectory observations. Our experiments conducted on the street scene dataset successfully reconstructed a 3D representation of the empty street. The mesh representation of the empty street can be extracted for further applications.

Exploring Backdoor Attacks against Embodied LLM-based Decision-Making Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20774v3)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant promise in real-world decision-making tasks for embodied artificial intelligence, especially when fine-tuned to leverage their inherent common sense and reasoning abilities while being tailored to specific applications. However, this fine-tuning process introduces considerable safety and security vulnerabilities, especially in safety-critical cyber-physical systems. In this work, we propose the first comprehensive framework for Backdoor Attacks against LLM-based Decision-making systems (BALD) in embodied AI, systematically exploring the attack surfaces and trigger mechanisms. Specifically, we propose three distinct attack mechanisms: word injection, scenario manipulation, and knowledge injection, targeting various components in the LLM-based decision-making pipeline. We perform extensive experiments on representative LLMs (GPT-3.5, LLaMA2, PaLM2) in autonomous driving and home robot tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness and stealthiness of our backdoor triggers across various attack channels, with cases like vehicles accelerating toward obstacles and robots placing knives on beds. Our word and knowledge injection attacks achieve nearly 100% success rate across multiple models and datasets while requiring only limited access to the system. Our scenario manipulation attack yields success rates exceeding 65%, reaching up to 90%, and does not require any runtime system intrusion. We also assess the robustness of these attacks against defenses, revealing their resilience. Our findings highlight critical security vulnerabilities in embodied LLM systems and emphasize the urgent need for safeguarding these systems to mitigate potential risks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted paper at ICLR 2025, 31 pages, including main paper, references, and appendix</p></details> |

In this paper, we define IGV as a technology that combines generative capabilities to produce diverse high-quality video content with interactive features that enable user engagement through control signals and responsive feedback. We survey the current landscape of IGV applications, focusing on three major domains: 1) gaming, where IGV enables infinite exploration in virtual worlds; 2) embodied AI, where IGV serves as a physics-aware environment synthesizer for training agents in multimodal interaction with dynamically evolving scenes; and 3) autonomous driving, where IGV provides closed-loop simulation capabilities for safety-critical testing and validation. To guide future development, we propose a comprehensive framework that decomposes an ideal IGV system into five essential modules: Generation, Control, Memory, Dynamics, and Intelligence. Furthermore, we systematically analyze the technical challenges and future directions in realizing each component for an ideal IGV system, such as achieving real-time generation, enabling open-domain control, maintaining long-term coherence, simulating accurate physics, and integrating causal reasoning. We believe that this systematic analysis will facilitate future research and development in the field of IGV, ultimately advancing the technology toward more sophisticated and practical applications.</p></details> |  |

This conclusion of Huellermeier et al. underpins the importance of calibrated uncertainties. Since AI-based algorithms are heavily impacted by dataset shifts, the automotive industry needs to safeguard its system against all possible contingencies. One important but often neglected dataset shift is caused by optical aberrations induced by the windshield. For the verification of the perception system performance, requirements on the AI performance need to be translated into optical metrics by a bijective mapping. Given this bijective mapping it is evident that the optical system characteristics add additional information about the magnitude of the dataset shift. As a consequence, we propose to incorporate a physical inductive bias into the neural network calibration architecture to enhance the robustness and the trustworthiness of the AI target application, which we demonstrate by using a semantic segmentation task as an example. By utilizing the Zernike coefficient vector of the optical system as a physical prior we can significantly reduce the mean expected calibration error in case of optical aberrations. As a result, we pave the way for a trustworthy uncertainty representation and for a holistic verification strategy of the perception chain.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems (T-ITS)</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose BEVWorld, a novel framework that transforms multimodal sensor inputs into a unified and compact Bird's Eye View (BEV) latent space for holistic environment modeling. The proposed world model consists of two main components: a multi-modal tokenizer and a latent BEV sequence diffusion model. The multi-modal tokenizer first encodes heterogeneous sensory data, and its decoder reconstructs the latent BEV tokens into LiDAR and surround-view image observations via ray-casting rendering in a self-supervised manner. This enables joint modeling and bidirectional encoding-decoding of panoramic imagery and point cloud data within a shared spatial representation. On top of this, the latent BEV sequence diffusion model performs temporally consistent forecasting of future scenes, conditioned on high-level action tokens, enabling scene-level reasoning over time. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of BEVWorld on autonomous driving benchmarks, showcasing its capability in realistic future scene generation and its benefits for downstream tasks such as perception and motion prediction.</p></details> | 10 pages |

However, the computational demands of virtual services and the inherent mobility of autonomous vehicles (AVs) necessitate real-time migration of Vehicular Embodied Agent AI Twins (VEAATs) between resource-constrained Roadside Units (RSUs). This paper proposes a novel framework for efficient VEAAT migration in VEANETs, combining a multi-leader multi-follower (MLMF) Stackelberg game-theoretic incentive mechanism with a tiny multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) algorithm. First, We propose an virtual immersive experience-driven utility model that captures AV-RSU dynamic interactions by integrating AVs' social influence, service complementarity and substitutability, and RSUs' resource allocation strategies to optimize VEAAT migration decisions. Second, to enhance training efficiency and enable efficient deployment on computation-constrained AVs while preserving exploration-exploitation performance, we propose TinyMA-IEI-PPO, a self-adaptive dynamic structured pruning algorithm that dynamically adjusts neuron importance based on agents' exploration incentives. Numerical results demonstrate that our approach achieves convergence comparable to baseline models and closely approximates the Stackelberg equilibrium.</p></details> |  |

Such universality typically requires joint training across multi-domain datasets to ensure effective generalization. However, monocular 3D object detection presents unique challenges in multi-domain training due to the scarcity of datasets annotated with accurate 3D ground-truth labels, especially beyond typical road-based autonomous driving contexts. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel weakly supervised framework leveraging pseudo-labels. Current pretrained models often struggle to accurately detect pedestrians in non-road environments due to inherent dataset biases. Unlike generalized image-based 2D object detection models, achieving similar generalization in monocular 3D detection remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose GATE3D, a novel framework designed specifically for generalized monocular 3D object detection via weak supervision. GATE3D effectively bridges domain gaps by employing consistency losses between 2D and 3D predictions. Remarkably, our model achieves competitive performance on the KITTI benchmark as well as on an indoor-office dataset collected by us to evaluate the generalization capabilities of our framework. Our results demonstrate that GATE3D significantly accelerates learning from limited annotated data through effective pre-training strategies, highlighting substantial potential for broader impacts in robotics, augmented reality, and virtual reality applications.

| **[BRIGHT-VO: Brightness-Guided Hybrid Transformer for Visual Odometry with Multi-modality Refinement Module](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08659v4)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual odometry (VO) plays a crucial role in autonomous driving, robotic navigation, and other related tasks by estimating the position and orientation of a camera based on visual input. Significant progress has been made in data-driven VO methods, particularly those leveraging deep learning techniques to extract image features and estimate camera poses. However, these methods often struggle in low-light conditions because of the reduced visibility of features and the increased difficulty of matching keypoints. To address this limitation, we introduce BrightVO, a novel VO model based on Transformer architecture, which not only performs front-end visual feature extraction, but also incorporates a multi-modality refinement module in the back-end that integrates Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data. Using pose graph optimization, this module iteratively refines pose estimates to reduce errors and improve both accuracy and robustness. Furthermore, we create a synthetic low-light dataset, KiC4R, which includes a variety of lighting conditions to facilitate the training and evaluation of VO frameworks in challenging environments. Experimental results demonstrate that BrightVO achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the KiC4R dataset and the KITTI benchmarks. Specifically, it provides an average improvement of 20% in pose estimation accuracy in normal outdoor environments and 259% in low-light conditions, outperforming existing methods. For widespread use and further development, the research work is fully open-source at https://github.com/Anastasiawd/BrightVO.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Human-AI Coordination through Adversarial Training and Generative Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15457v2)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Being able to cooperate with new people is an important component of many economically valuable AI tasks, from household robotics to autonomous driving. However, generalizing to novel humans requires training on data that captures the diversity of human behaviors. Adversarial training is one avenue for searching for such data and ensuring that agents are robust. However, it is difficult to apply in the cooperative setting because adversarial policies intentionally learn to sabotage the task instead of simulating valid cooperation partners. To address this challenge, we propose a novel strategy for overcoming self-sabotage that combines a pre-trained generative model to simulate valid cooperative agent policies with adversarial training to maximize regret. We call our method GOAT: Generative Online Adversarial Training. In this framework, the GOAT dynamically searches for and generates coordination strategies where the learning policy -- the Cooperator agent -- underperforms. GOAT enables better generalization by exposing the Cooperator to various challenging interaction scenarios. We maintain realistic coordination strategies by updating only the generative model's embedding while keeping its parameters frozen, thus avoiding adversarial exploitation. We evaluate GOAT with real human partners, and the results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on the Overcooked benchmark, highlighting its effectiveness in generalizing to diverse human behaviors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Composite Safety Potential Field for Highway Driving Risk Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21158v1)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the era of rapid advancements in vehicle safety technologies, driving risk assessment has become a focal point of attention. Technologies such as collision warning systems, advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), and autonomous driving require driving risks to be evaluated proactively and in real time. To be effective, driving risk assessment metrics must not only accurately identify potential collisions but also exhibit human-like reasoning to enable safe and seamless interactions between vehicles. Existing safety potential field models assess driving risks by considering both objective and subjective safety factors. However, their practical applicability in real-world risk assessment tasks is limited. These models are often challenging to calibrate due to the arbitrary nature of their structures, and calibration can be inefficient because of the scarcity of accident statistics. Additionally, they struggle to generalize across both longitudinal and lateral risks. To address these challenges, we propose a composite safety potential field framework, namely C-SPF, involving a subjective field to capture drivers' risk perception about spatial proximity and an objective field to quantify the imminent collision probability, to comprehensively evaluate driving risks. The C-SPF is calibrated using abundant two-dimensional spacing data from trajectory datasets, enabling it to effectively capture drivers' proximity risk perception and provide a more realistic explanation of driving behaviors. Analysis of a naturalistic driving dataset demonstrates that the C-SPF can capture both longitudinal and lateral risks that trigger drivers' safety maneuvers. Further case studies highlight the C-SPF's ability to explain lateral driver behaviors, such as abandoning lane changes or adjusting lateral position relative to adjacent vehicles, which are capabilities that existing models fail to achieve.</p></details> |  |

To promote both safety and courtesy in AV's behavior, an extension of Control Barrier Functions (CBFs)-inspired risk evaluation framework is proposed in this paper by considering both noisy observed positions and velocities of surrounding vehicles. The perceived risk by the ego vehicle can be visualized as a risk map that reflects the understanding of the surrounding environment and thus shows the potential for facilitating safe and courteous driving. By incorporating the risk evaluation framework into the Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme, we propose a Courteous MPC for ego AV to generate courteous behaviors that 1) reduce the overall risk imposed on other vehicles and 2) respect the hard safety constraints and the original objective for efficiency. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed Courteous MPC via theoretical analysis and simulation experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, accepted to ITSC 2024</p></details> |

This paper proposes a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework based on the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm to optimize autonomous parking tasks. SAC, an off-policy method with entropy regularization, is particularly well-suited for continuous action spaces, enabling fine-grained vehicle control. We model the parking task as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and train an agent to maximize cumulative rewards while balancing exploration and exploitation through entropy maximization. The proposed system integrates multiple sensor inputs into a high-dimensional state space and leverages SAC's dual critic networks and policy network to achieve stable learning. Simulation results show that the SAC-based approach delivers high parking success rates, reduced maneuver times, and robust handling of dynamic obstacles, outperforming traditional rule-based methods and other DRL algorithms. This study demonstrates SAC's potential in autonomous parking and lays the foundation for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural Stereo Video Compression with Hybrid Disparity Compensation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20383v1)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Disparity compensation represents the primary strategy in stereo video compression (SVC) for exploiting cross-view redundancy. These mechanisms can be broadly categorized into two types: one that employs explicit horizontal shifting, and another that utilizes an implicit cross-attention mechanism to reduce cross-view disparity redundancy. In this work, we propose a hybrid disparity compensation (HDC) strategy that leverages explicit pixel displacement as a robust prior feature to simplify optimization and perform implicit cross-attention mechanisms for subsequent warping operations, thereby capturing a broader range of disparity information. Specifically, HDC first computes a similarity map by fusing the horizontally shifted cross-view features to capture pixel displacement information. This similarity map is then normalized into an "explicit pixel-wise attention score" to perform the cross-attention mechanism, implicitly aligning features from one view to another. Building upon HDC, we introduce a novel end-to-end optimized neural stereo video compression framework, which integrates HDC-based modules into key coding operations, including cross-view feature extraction and reconstruction (HDC-FER) and cross-view entropy modeling (HDC-EM). Extensive experiments on SVC benchmarks, including KITTI 2012, KITTI 2015, and Nagoya, which cover both autonomous driving and general scenes, demonstrate that our framework outperforms both neural and traditional SVC methodologies.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes a novel multimodal depth estimation model, RTFusion, which enhances depth estimation accuracy and robustness by integrating the complementary strengths of RGB and THR data. The RGB modality provides rich texture and color information, while the THR modality captures thermal patterns, ensuring stability under adverse lighting conditions such as extreme illumination. The model incorporates a unique fusion mechanism, EGFusion, consisting of the Mutual Complementary Attention (MCA) module for cross-modal feature alignment and the Edge Saliency Enhancement Module (ESEM) to improve edge detail preservation. Comprehensive experiments on the MS2 and ViViD++ datasets demonstrate that the proposed model consistently produces high-quality depth maps across various challenging environments, including nighttime, rainy, and high-glare conditions. The experimental results highlight the potential of the proposed method in applications requiring reliable depth estimation, such as autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality.</p></details> | 7 pages, 2 figures |

It is becoming increasingly likely that autonomous vehicles (AVs) would soon coexist with human-driven vehicles (HVs) on the roads. Currently, safety and reliable decision-making remain significant challenges, particularly when AVs are navigating lane changes and interacting with surrounding HVs. Therefore, precise estimation of the intentions of surrounding HVs can assist AVs in making more reliable and safe lane change decision-making. This involves not only understanding their current behaviors but also predicting their future motions without any direct communication. However, distinguishing between the passing and yielding intentions of surrounding HVs still remains ambiguous. To address the challenge, we propose a social intention estimation algorithm rooted in Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), coupled with a decision-making framework employing Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms. To evaluate the method's performance, the proposed framework can be tested and applied in a lane-changing scenario within a simulated environment. Furthermore, the experiment results demonstrate how our approach enhances the ability of AVs to navigate lane changes safely and efficiently on roads.</p></details> |  |

By leveraging Level-k game theory, CHARMS captures human-like reasoning patterns through a two-stage training pipeline comprising reinforcement learning pretraining and supervised fine-tuning. This enables the resulting models to exhibit diverse and human-like behaviors, enhancing their decision-making capacity and interaction fidelity in complex traffic environments. Building upon this capability, we further develop a scenario generation framework that utilizes the Poisson cognitive hierarchy theory to control the distribution of vehicles with different driving styles through Poisson and binomial sampling. Experimental results demonstrate that CHARMS is capable of both making intelligent driving decisions as an ego vehicle and generating diverse, realistic driving scenarios as environment vehicles.

| **[Open-set Anomaly Segmentation in Complex Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19706v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Precise segmentation of out-of-distribution (OoD) objects, herein referred to as anomalies, is crucial for the reliable deployment of semantic segmentation models in open-set, safety-critical applications, such as autonomous driving. Current anomalous segmentation benchmarks predominantly focus on favorable weather conditions, resulting in untrustworthy evaluations that overlook the risks posed by diverse meteorological conditions in open-set environments, such as low illumination, dense fog, and heavy rain. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces the ComsAmy, a challenging benchmark specifically designed for open-set anomaly segmentation in complex scenarios. ComsAmy encompasses a wide spectrum of adverse weather conditions, dynamic driving environments, and diverse anomaly types to comprehensively evaluate the model performance in realistic open-world scenarios. Our extensive evaluation of several state-of-the-art anomalous segmentation models reveals that existing methods demonstrate significant deficiencies in such challenging scenarios, highlighting their serious safety risks for real-world deployment. To solve that, we propose a novel energy-entropy learning (EEL) strategy that integrates the complementary information from energy and entropy to bolster the robustness of anomaly segmentation under complex open-world environments. Additionally, a diffusion-based anomalous training data synthesizer is proposed to generate diverse and high-quality anomalous images to enhance the existing copy-paste training data synthesizer. Extensive experimental results on both public and ComsAmy benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed diffusion-based synthesizer with energy and entropy learning (DiffEEL) serves as an effective and generalizable plug-and-play method to enhance existing models, yielding an average improvement of around 4.96% in $\rm{AUPRC}$ and 9.87% in $\rm{FPR}_{95}$.</p></details> |  |
| **[CE-NPBG: Connectivity Enhanced Neural Point-Based Graphics for Novel View Synthesis in Autonomous Driving Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19557v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current point-based approaches encounter limitations in scalability and rendering quality when using large 3D point cloud maps because using them directly for novel view synthesis (NVS) leads to degraded visualizations. We identify the primary issue behind these low-quality renderings as a visibility mismatch between geometry and appearance, stemming from using these two modalities together. To address this problem, we present CE-NPBG, a new approach for novel view synthesis (NVS) in large-scale autonomous driving scenes. Our method is a neural point-based technique that leverages two modalities: posed images (cameras) and synchronized raw 3D point clouds (LiDAR). We first employ a connectivity relationship graph between appearance and geometry, which retrieves points from a large 3D point cloud map observed from the current camera perspective and uses them for rendering. By leveraging this connectivity, our method significantly improves rendering quality and enhances run-time and scalability by using only a small subset of points from the large 3D point cloud map. Our approach associates neural descriptors with the points and uses them to synthesize views. To enhance the encoding of these descriptors and elevate rendering quality, we propose a joint adversarial and point rasterization training. During training, we pair an image-synthesizer network with a multi-resolution discriminator. At inference, we decouple them and use the image-synthesizer to generate novel views. We also integrate our proposal into the recent 3D Gaussian Splatting work to highlight its benefits for improved rendering and scalability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in 2025 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW)</p></details> |
| **[Revisiting Outage for Edge Inference Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03686v2)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the key missions of sixth-generation (6G) mobile networks is to deploy large-scale artificial intelligence (AI) models at the network edge to provide remote-inference services for edge devices. The resultant platform, known as edge inference, will support a wide range of Internet-of-Things applications, such as autonomous driving, industrial automation, and augmented reality. Given the mission-critical and time-sensitive nature of these tasks, it is essential to design edge inference systems that are both reliable and capable of meeting stringent end-to-end (E2E) latency constraints. Existing studies, which primarily focus on communication reliability as characterized by channel outage probability, may fail to guarantee E2E performance, specifically in terms of E2E inference accuracy and latency. To address this limitation, we propose a theoretical framework that introduces and mathematically characterizes the inference outage (InfOut) probability, which quantifies the likelihood that the E2E inference accuracy falls below a target threshold. Under an E2E latency constraint, this framework establishes a fundamental tradeoff between communication overhead (i.e., uploading more sensor observations) and inference reliability as quantified by the InfOut probability. To find a tractable way to optimize this tradeoff, we derive accurate surrogate functions for InfOut probability by applying a Gaussian approximation to the distribution of the received discriminant gain. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed design over conventional communication-centric approaches in terms of E2E inference reliability.</p></details> |  |

This study introduces Interactive Double Deep Q-network (iDDQN), a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) approach that enhances Reinforcement Learning (RL) by merging human insights directly into the RL training process, improving model performance. Our proposed iDDQN method modifies the Q-value update equation to integrate human and agent actions, establishing a collaborative approach for policy development. Additionally, we present an offline evaluative framework that simulates the agent's trajectory as if no human intervention had occurred, to assess the effectiveness of human interventions. Empirical results in simulated autonomous driving scenarios demonstrate that iDDQN outperforms established approaches, including Behavioral Cloning (BC), HG-DAgger, Deep Q-Learning from Demonstrations (DQfD), and vanilla DRL in leveraging human expertise for improving performance and adaptability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV) 2025, 8 pages</p></details> |

In this paper, we work towards developing a generalized computer vision system able to detect lanes without using any annotation. We make the following contributions: (i) We illustrate how to perform unsupervised 3D lane segmentation by leveraging the distinctive intensity of lanes on the LiDAR point cloud frames, and then obtain the noisy lane labels in the 2D plane by projecting the 3D points; (ii) We propose a novel self-supervised training scheme, dubbed LaneCorrect, that automatically corrects the lane label by learning geometric consistency and instance awareness from the adversarial augmentations; (iii) With the self-supervised pre-trained model, we distill to train a student network for arbitrary target lane (e.g., TuSimple) detection without any human labels; (iv) We thoroughly evaluate our self-supervised method on four major lane detection benchmarks (including TuSimple, CULane, CurveLanes and LLAMAS) and demonstrate excellent performance compared with existing supervised counterpart, whilst showing more effective results on alleviating the domain gap, i.e., training on CULane and test on TuSimple.</p></details> | IJCV 2025 |
| **[Real-Time Image Segmentation via Hybrid Convolutional-Transformer Architecture Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10413v2)** | 2025-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image segmentation is one of the most fundamental problems in computer vision and has drawn a lot of attention due to its vast applications in image understanding and autonomous driving. However, designing effective and efficient segmentation neural architectures is a labor-intensive process that may require numerous trials by human experts. In this paper, we address the challenge of integrating multi-head self-attention into high-resolution representation CNNs efficiently by leveraging architecture search. Manually replacing convolution layers with multi-head self-attention is non-trivial due to the costly overhead in memory to maintain high resolution. By contrast, we develop a multi-target multi-branch supernet method, which not only fully utilizes the advantages of high-resolution features but also finds the proper location for placing the multi-head self-attention module. Our search algorithm is optimized towards multiple objectives (e.g., latency and mIoU) and is capable of finding architectures on the Pareto frontier with an arbitrary number of branches in a single search. We further present a series of models via the Hybrid Convolutional-Transformer Architecture Search (HyCTAS) method that searches for the best hybrid combination of light-weight convolution layers and memory-efficient self-attention layers between branches from different resolutions and fuses them to high resolution for both efficiency and effectiveness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HyCTAS outperforms previous methods in both semantic segmentation and panoptic segmentation tasks.

| **[CARL: Camera-Agnostic Representation Learning for Spectral Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19223v1)** | 2025-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spectral imaging offers promising applications across diverse domains, including medicine and urban scene understanding, and is already established as a critical modality in remote sensing. However, variability in channel dimensionality and captured wavelengths among spectral cameras impede the development of AI-driven methodologies, leading to camera-specific models with limited generalizability and inadequate cross-camera applicability. To address this bottleneck, we introduce $\textbf{CARL}$, a model for $\textbf{C}$amera-$\textbf{A}$gnostic $\textbf{R}$epresentation $\textbf{L}$earning across RGB, multispectral, and hyperspectral imaging modalities. To enable the conversion of a spectral image with any channel dimensionality to a camera-agnostic embedding, we introduce wavelength positional encoding and a self-attention-cross-attention mechanism to compress spectral information into learned query representations. Spectral-spatial pre-training is achieved with a novel spectral self-supervised JEPA-inspired strategy tailored to CARL. Large-scale experiments across the domains of medical imaging, autonomous driving, and satellite imaging demonstrate our model's unique robustness to spectral heterogeneity, outperforming on datasets with simulated and real-world cross-camera spectral variations. The scalability and versatility of the proposed approach position our model as a backbone for future spectral foundation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Segmenting Objectiveness and Task-awareness Unknown Region for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19183v1)** | 2025-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the emergence of transformer-based architectures and large language models (LLMs), the accuracy of road scene perception has substantially advanced. Nonetheless, current road scene segmentation approaches are predominantly trained on closed-set data, resulting in insufficient detection capabilities for out-of-distribution (OOD) objects. To overcome this limitation, road anomaly detection methods have been proposed. However, existing methods primarily depend on image inpainting and OOD distribution detection techniques, facing two critical issues: (1) inadequate consideration of the objectiveness attributes of anomalous regions, causing incomplete segmentation when anomalous objects share similarities with known classes, and (2) insufficient attention to environmental constraints, leading to the detection of anomalies irrelevant to autonomous driving tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel framework termed Segmenting Objectiveness and Task-Awareness (SOTA) for autonomous driving scenes. Specifically, SOTA enhances the segmentation of objectiveness through a Semantic Fusion Block (SFB) and filters anomalies irrelevant to road navigation tasks using a Scene-understanding Guided Prompt-Context Adaptor (SG-PCA). Extensive empirical evaluations on multiple benchmark datasets, including Fishyscapes Lost and Found, Segment-Me-If-You-Can, and RoadAnomaly, demonstrate that the proposed SOTA consistently improves OOD detection performance across diverse detectors, achieving robust and accurate segmentation outcomes.</p></details> |  |

We propose a new benchmark tailored for online evaluation by considering runtime latency. Based on the benchmark, we build a Latency-Aware 3D Streaming Perception (LASP) framework that addresses the latency issue through two primary components: 1) latency-aware history integration, which extends query propagation into a continuous process, ensuring the integration of historical feature regardless of varying latency; 2) latency-aware predictive detection, a module that compensates the detection results with the predicted trajectory and the posterior accessed latency. By incorporating the latency-aware mechanism, our method shows generalization across various latency levels, achieving an online performance that closely aligns with 80\% of its offline evaluation on the Jetson AGX Orin without any acceleration techniques.</p></details> |  |

Various safety mechanisms are simulated to assess their impact on mitigating attacks and enhancing ADAS resilience. Experimental results highlight the importance of timely intervention by human drivers and automated safety mechanisms in preventing accidents in both driving and lateral directions and the need to resolve conflicts among safety interventions to enhance system resilience and reliability.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, To appear in the 55th Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Federated Learning-based Semantic Segmentation for Lane and Object Detection in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18939v1)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) require precise lane and object detection to ensure safe navigation. However, centralized deep learning (DL) approaches for semantic segmentation raise privacy and scalability challenges, particularly when handling sensitive data. This research presents a new federated learning (FL) framework that integrates secure deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Differential Privacy (DP) to address these issues. The core contribution of this work involves: (1) developing a new hybrid UNet-ResNet34 architecture for centralized semantic segmentation to achieve high accuracy and tackle privacy concerns due to centralized training, and (2) implementing the privacy-preserving FL model, distributed across AVs to enhance performance through secure CNNs and DP mechanisms. In the proposed FL framework, the methodology distinguishes itself from the existing approach through the following: (a) ensuring data decentralization through FL to uphold user privacy by eliminating the need for centralized data aggregation, (b) integrating DP mechanisms to secure sensitive model updates against potential adversarial inference attacks, and (c) evaluating the frameworks performance and generalizability using RGB and semantic segmentation datasets derived from the CARLA simulator. Experimental results show significant improvements in accuracy, from 81.5% to 88.7% for the RGB dataset and from 79.3% to 86.9% for the SEG dataset over 20 to 70 Communication Rounds (CRs). Global loss was reduced by over 60%, and minor accuracy trade-offs from DP were observed. This study contributes by offering a scalable, privacy-preserving FL framework tailored for AVs, optimizing communication efficiency while balancing performance and data security.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication in Scientific Reports</p></details> |
| **[Advanced Longitudinal Control and Collision Avoidance for High-Risk Edge Cases in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18931v1)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Advanced Driving Systems (ADS) are key to improving road safety, yet most existing implementations focus primarily on the vehicle ahead, neglecting the behavior of following vehicles. This shortfall often leads to chain reaction collisions in high speed, densely spaced traffic particularly when a middle vehicle suddenly brakes and trailing vehicles cannot respond in time. To address this critical gap, we propose a novel longitudinal control and collision avoidance algorithm that integrates adaptive cruising with emergency braking. Leveraging deep reinforcement learning, our method simultaneously accounts for both leading and following vehicles. Through a data preprocessing framework that calibrates real-world sensor data, we enhance the robustness and reliability of the training process, ensuring the learned policy can handle diverse driving conditions. In simulated high risk scenarios (e.g., emergency braking in dense traffic), the algorithm effectively prevents potential pile up collisions, even in situations involving heavy duty vehicles. Furthermore, in typical highway scenarios where three vehicles decelerate, the proposed DRL approach achieves a 99% success rate far surpassing the standard Federal Highway Administration speed concepts guide, which reaches only 36.77% success under the same conditions.</p></details> |  |

While supervised learning remains the standard method, reinforcement learning (RL) offers unique advantages through its sequential decision-making framework, which naturally fits the iterative nature of data assimilation by dynamically balancing model forecasts with observations. We develop RL-DAUNCE, a new RL-based method that enhances data assimilation with physical constraints through three key aspects. First, RL-DAUNCE inherits the computational efficiency of machine learning while it uniquely structures its agents to mirror ensemble members in conventional data assimilation methods. Second, RL-DAUNCE emphasizes uncertainty quantification by advancing multiple ensemble members, moving beyond simple mean-state optimization. Third, RL-DAUNCE's ensemble-as-agents design facilitates the enforcement of physical constraints during the assimilation process, which is crucial to improving the state estimation and subsequent forecasting. A primal-dual optimization strategy is developed to enforce constraints, which dynamically penalizes the reward function to ensure constraint satisfaction throughout the learning process. Also, state variable bounds are respected by constraining the RL action space. Together, these features ensure physical consistency without sacrificing efficiency. RL-DAUNCE is applied to the Madden-Julian Oscillation, an intermittent atmospheric phenomenon characterized by strongly non-Gaussian features and multiple physical constraints. RL-DAUNCE outperforms the standard ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), which fails catastrophically due to the violation of physical constraints. Notably, RL-DAUNCE matches the performance of constrained EnKF, particularly in recovering intermittent signals, capturing extreme events, and quantifying uncertainties, while requiring substantially less computational effort.</p></details> |  |

The goal was to build a simulation framework capable of forecasting the remainder of the season, starting from a 20 game burn-in period to establish initial estimates of team strength. My approach used a Bayesian inference model incorporating team win percentage, batting average, and pitching ERA to construct a posterior distribution of win probability for each matchup. For each game, I sampled from the posterior and simulated the outcome using a Bernoulli trial. Because future matchup inputs were unobserved, I forecasted batting averages using random walks and modeled pitching ERA with Kalman filters. After simulating many seasons, the model produced a distribution of win totals for all 30 teams and can also be used to estimate each team's probability of making the postseason.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exact nonlinear state estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10976v2)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The majority of data assimilation (DA) methods in the geosciences are based on Gaussian assumptions. While these assumptions facilitate efficient algorithms, they cause analysis biases and subsequent forecast degradations. Non-parametric, particle-based DA algorithms have superior accuracy, but their application to high-dimensional models still poses operational challenges. Drawing inspiration from recent advances in the field of generative artificial intelligence (AI), this article introduces a new nonlinear estimation theory which attempts to bridge the existing gap in DA methodology. Specifically, a Conjugate Transform Filter (CTF) is derived and shown to generalize the celebrated Kalman filter to arbitrarily non-Gaussian distributions. The new filter has several desirable properties, such as its ability to preserve statistical relationships in the prior state and convergence to highly accurate observations. An ensemble approximation of the new theory (ECTF) is also presented and validated using idealized statistical experiments that feature bounded quantities with non-Gaussian distributions, a prevalent challenge in Earth system models. Results from these experiments indicate that the greatest benefits from ECTF occur when observation errors are small relative to the forecast uncertainty and when state variables exhibit strong nonlinear dependencies. Ultimately, the new filtering theory offers exciting avenues for improving conventional DA algorithms through their principled integration with AI techniques.</p></details> |  |

The proposed method integrates Kalman filters for motion prediction with a dynamic network flow model to enhance real-time video capture efficiency. By assigning Kalman filters to tracked objects, the system predicts future locations, enabling precise scheduling of camera tasks. This prediction-driven approach is formulated as a network flow optimization, ensuring scalability and adaptability to various surveillance scenarios. To further reduce redundant monitoring, we also incorporate group-tracking nodes, allowing multiple objects to be captured within a single camera focus when appropriate. In addition, a value-based system is introduced to prioritize camera actions, focusing on the timely capture of critical events. By adjusting the decay rates of these values over time, the system ensures prompt responses to tasks with imminent deadlines. Extensive simulations demonstrate that this approach improves coverage, reduces average wait times, and minimizes missed events compared to traditional master-slave camera systems. Overall, our method significantly enhances the efficiency, scalability, and effectiveness of surveillance systems, particularly in dynamic and crowded environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 3 Figures, Accepted at AIRC 2025</p></details> |
| **[On the sensitivity of different ensemble filters to the type of assimilated observation networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04541v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in data assimilation (DA) have focused on developing more flexible approaches that can better accommodate nonlinearities in models and observations. However, it remains unclear how the performance of these advanced methods depends on the observation network characteristics. In this study, we present initial experiments with the surface quasi-geostrophic model, in which we compare a recently developed AI-based ensemble filter with the standard Local Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter (LETKF). Our results show that the analysis solutions respond differently to the number, spatial distribution, and nonlinear fraction of assimilated observations. We also find notable changes in the multiscale characteristics of the analysis errors. Given that standard DA techniques will be eventually replaced by more advanced methods, we hope this study sets the ground for future efforts to reassess the value of Earth observation systems in the context of newly emerging algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spectral and Temporal Denoising for Differentially Private Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04468v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces the FFT-Enhanced Kalman Filter (FFTKF), a differentially private optimization method that addresses the challenge of preserving performance in DP-SGD, where added noise typically degrades model utility. FFTKF integrates frequency-domain noise shaping with Kalman filtering to enhance gradient quality while preserving $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DP guarantees. It employs a high-frequency shaping mask in the Fourier domain to concentrate differential privacy noise in less informative spectral components, preserving low-frequency gradient signals. A scalar-gain Kalman filter with finite-difference Hessian approximation further refines the denoised gradients. With a per-iteration complexity of $\mathcal{O}(d \log d)$, FFTKF demonstrates improved test accuracy over DP-SGD and DiSK across MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet datasets using CNNs, Wide ResNets, and Vision Transformers. Theoretical analysis confirms that FFTKF maintains equivalent privacy guarantees while achieving a tighter privacy-utility trade-off through reduced noise and controlled bias.</p></details> |  |

In this paper we present a numerical scheme that successfully reconstructs input training, real-world, practical data from trainable VQNNs' gradients. Our scheme is based on gradient inversion that works by combining gradients estimation with the finite difference method and adaptive low-pass filtering. The scheme is further optimized with Kalman filter to obtain efficient convergence. Our experiments show that our algorithm can invert even batch-trained data, given the VQNN model is sufficiently over-parameterized.</p></details> | 9 pages, 17 figures |

| **[Thermal-LiDAR Fusion for Robust Tunnel Localization in GNSS-Denied and Low-Visibility Conditions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03565v1)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite significant progress in autonomous navigation, a critical gap remains in ensuring reliable localization in hazardous environments such as tunnels, urban disaster zones, and underground structures. Tunnels present a uniquely difficult scenario: they are not only prone to GNSS signal loss, but also provide little features for visual localization due to their repetitive walls and poor lighting. These conditions degrade conventional vision-based and LiDAR-based systems, which rely on distinguishable environmental features. To address this, we propose a novel sensor fusion framework that integrates a thermal camera with a LiDAR to enable robust localization in tunnels and other perceptually degraded environments. The thermal camera provides resilience in low-light or smoke conditions, while the LiDAR delivers precise depth perception and structural awareness. By combining these sensors, our framework ensures continuous and accurate localization across diverse and dynamic environments. We use an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to fuse multi-sensor inputs, and leverages visual odometry and SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) techniques to process the sensor data, enabling robust motion estimation and mapping even in GNSS-denied environments. This fusion of sensor modalities not only enhances system resilience but also provides a scalable solution for cyber-physical systems in connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). To validate the framework, we conduct tests in a tunnel environment, simulating sensor degradation and visibility challenges. The results demonstrate that our method sustains accurate localization where standard approaches deteriorate due to the tunnels featureless geometry. The frameworks versatility makes it a promising solution for autonomous vehicles, inspection robots, and other cyber-physical systems operating in constrained, perceptually poor environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IAVVC 2025</p></details> |

These methods are used for state estimation of dynamic systems by relying on mathematical representations in the form of simple state-space (SS) models, which may be crude and inaccurate descriptions of the underlying dynamics. Emerging data-centric artificial intelligence (AI) techniques tackle these tasks using deep neural networks (DNNs), which are model-agnostic. Recent developments illustrate the possibility of fusing DNNs with classic Kalman-type filtering, obtaining systems that learn to track in partially known dynamics. This article provides a tutorial-style overview of design approaches for incorporating AI in aiding KF-type algorithms. We review both generic and dedicated DNN architectures suitable for state estimation, and provide a systematic presentation of techniques for fusing AI tools with KFs and for leveraging partial SS modeling and data, categorizing design approaches into task-oriented and SS model-oriented. The usefulness of each approach in preserving the individual strengths of model-based KFs and data-driven DNNs is investigated in a qualitative and quantitative study, whose code is publicly available, illustrating the gains of hybrid model-based/data-driven designs. We also discuss existing challenges and future research directions that arise from fusing AI and Kalman-type algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the IEEE Signal Processing Magazine</p></details> |

This introduces a candidate method (the locally weighted Ensemble Kalman method for inversion) with the motivation of combining some of the strengths of the particle filter (ability to cope with nonlinear maps and non-Gaussian distributions) and the Ensemble Kalman filter (no filter degeneracy). We provide some numerical evidence for the accuracy of locally weighted ensemble methods, both in terms of approximation and inversion.</p></details> |  |
| **[Analysis of the Unscented Transform for Cooperative Localization with Ranging-Only Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07242v2)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cooperative localization in multi-agent robotic systems is challenging, especially when agents rely on limited information, such as only peer-to-peer range measurements. Two key challenges arise: utilizing this limited information to improve position estimation; handling uncertainties from sensor noise, nonlinearity, and unknown correlations between agents measurements; and avoiding information reuse. This paper examines the use of the Unscented Transform (UT) for state estimation for a case in which range measurement between agents and covariance intersection (CI) is used to handle unknown correlations. Unlike Kalman Filter approaches, CI methods fuse complete state and covariance estimates. This makes formulating a CI approach with ranging-only measurements a challenge. To overcome this, UT is used to handle uncertainties and formulate a cooperative state update using range measurements and current cooperative state estimates. This introduces information reuse in the measurement update. Therefore, this work aims to evaluate the limitations and utility of this formulation when faced with various levels of state measurement uncertainty and errors.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 figures.

| **[Ensemble Kalman filter for uncertainty in human language comprehension](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02590v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are widely used in modeling sentence processing but often exhibit deterministic behavior, contrasting with human sentence comprehension, which manages uncertainty during ambiguous or unexpected inputs. This is exemplified by reversal anomalies-sentences with unexpected role reversals that challenge syntax and semantics-highlighting the limitations of traditional ANN models, such as the Sentence Gestalt (SG) Model. To address these limitations, we propose a Bayesian framework for sentence comprehension, applying an extension of the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) for Bayesian inference to quantify uncertainty. By framing language comprehension as a Bayesian inverse problem, this approach enhances the SG model's ability to reflect human sentence processing with respect to the representation of uncertainty. Numerical experiments and comparisons with maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) demonstrate that Bayesian methods improve uncertainty representation, enabling the model to better approximate human cognitive processing when dealing with linguistic ambiguities.</p></details> |  |
| **[SafeNav: Safe Path Navigation using Landmark Based Localization in a GPS-denied Environment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01956v1)** | 2025-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In battlefield environments, adversaries frequently disrupt GPS signals, requiring alternative localization and navigation methods. Traditional vision-based approaches like Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and Visual Odometry (VO) involve complex sensor fusion and high computational demand, whereas range-free methods like DV-HOP face accuracy and stability challenges in sparse, dynamic networks. This paper proposes LanBLoc-BMM, a navigation approach using landmark-based localization (LanBLoc) combined with a battlefield-specific motion model (BMM) and Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). Its performance is benchmarked against three state-of-the-art visual localization algorithms integrated with BMM and Bayesian filters, evaluated on synthetic and real-imitated trajectory datasets using metrics including Average Displacement Error (ADE), Final Displacement Error (FDE), and a newly introduced Average Weighted Risk Score (AWRS). LanBLoc-BMM (with EKF) demonstrates superior performance in ADE, FDE, and AWRS on real-imitated datasets. Additionally, two safe navigation methods, SafeNav-CHull and SafeNav-Centroid, are introduced by integrating LanBLoc-BMM(EKF) with a novel Risk-Aware RRT* (RAw-RRT*) algorithm for obstacle avoidance and risk exposure minimization. Simulation results in battlefield scenarios indicate SafeNav-Centroid excels in accuracy, risk exposure, and trajectory efficiency, while SafeNav-CHull provides superior computational speed.</p></details> |  |

We present PhysNav-DG, a novel framework that integrates classical sensor fusion with the semantic power of vision-language models. Our dual-branch architecture predicts navigation actions from multi-sensor inputs while simultaneously generating detailed chain-of-thought explanations. A modified Adaptive Kalman Filter dynamically adjusts its noise parameters based on environmental context. It leverages several streams of raw sensor data along with semantic insights from models such as LLaMA 3.2 11B and BLIP-2. To evaluate our approach, we introduce the MD-NEX Benchmark, a novel multi-domain dataset that unifies indoor navigation, autonomous driving, and social navigation tasks with ground-truth actions and human-validated explanations. Extensive experiments and ablations show that PhysNav-DG improves navigation success rates by over 20% and achieves high efficiency, with explanations that are both highly grounded and clear. This work connects high-level semantic reasoning and geometric planning for safer and more trustworthy autonomous systems.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Uncertainty-Aware Bayes' Rule and Its Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05532v3)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bayes' rule has enabled innumerable powerful algorithms of statistical signal processing and statistical machine learning. However, when model misspecifications exist in prior and/or data distributions, the direct application of Bayes' rule is questionable. Philosophically, the key is to balance the relative importance between prior and data distributions when calculating posterior distributions: if prior distributions are overly conservative (i.e., exceedingly spread), we upweight the prior belief; if prior distributions are overly opportunistic (i.e., exceedingly concentrated), we downweight the prior belief. The same operation also applies to data distributions. This paper studies a generalized Bayes' rule, called uncertainty-aware Bayes' rule, to technically realize the above philosophy, thus combating the model uncertainties in prior and/or data distributions. Applications of the uncertainty-aware Bayes' rule on classification and estimation are discussed: In particular, the uncertainty-aware Bayes classifier, the uncertainty-aware Kalman filter, the uncertainty-aware particle filter, and the uncertainty-aware interactive-multiple-model filter are suggested and experimentally validated.</p></details> |  |

However, achieving sub-10 m accuracy in indoor localization remains challenging due to complex environmental conditions, multipath fading, and transient obstructions. This paper proposes a lightweight but robust approach combining adaptive filtering with an extended log-distance, multi-wall path loss and shadowing (PLS) model. Our methodology augments conventional models with critical LoRaWAN parameters (received signal strength indicator (RSSI), frequency, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)) and dynamic environmental indicators (temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide, particulate matter, and barometric pressure). An adaptive Kalman filter reduces RSSI fluctuations, isolating persistent trends from momentary noise. Using a six-month dataset of 1,328,334 field measurements, we evaluate three models: the baseline COST 231 multi-wall model (MWM), the baseline model augmented with environmental parameters (MWM-EP), and a forward-only adaptive Kalman-filtered RSSI version of the latter (MWM-EP-KF). Results confirm that the MWM-EP-KF achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 5.81 m, outperforming both the MWM-EP (10.56 m) and the baseline MWM framework (17.98 m). Environmental augmentation reduces systematic errors by 41.22%, while Kalman filtering significantly enhances robustness under high RSSI volatility by 42.63%, on average across all devices. These findings present an interpretable, efficient solution for precise indoor LoRaWAN localization in dynamically changing environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Remote Estimation over Packet-Dropping Wireless Channels with Partial State Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01132v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we study the design of an optimal transmission policy for remote state estimation over packet-dropping wireless channels with imperfect channel state information. A smart sensor uses a Kalman filter to estimate the system state and transmits its information to a remote estimator. Our objective is to minimize the state estimation error and energy consumption by deciding whether to transmit new information or retransmit previously failed packets. To balance the trade-off between information freshness and reliability, the sensor applies a hybrid automatic repeat request protocol. We formulate this problem as a finite horizon partially observable Markov decision process with an augmented state-space that incorporates both the age of information and the unknown channel state. By defining an information state, we derive the dynamic programming equations for evaluating the optimal policy. This transmission policy is computed numerically using the point-based value iteration algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Unified QoS-Aware Multiplexing Framework for Next Generation Immersive Communication with Legacy Wireless Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21444v2)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Immersive communication, including emerging augmented reality, virtual reality, and holographic telepresence, has been identified as a key service for enabling next-generation wireless applications. To align with legacy wireless applications, such as enhanced mobile broadband or ultra-reliable low-latency communication, network slicing has been widely adopted. However, attempting to statistically isolate the above types of wireless applications through different network slices may lead to throughput degradation and increased queue backlog. To address these challenges, we establish a unified QoS-aware framework that supports immersive communication and legacy wireless applications simultaneously. Based on the Lyapunov drift theorem, we transform the original long-term throughput maximization problem into an equivalent short-term throughput maximization weighted by virtual queue length. Moreover, to cope with the challenges introduced by the interaction between large-timescale network slicing and short-timescale resource allocation, we propose an adaptive adversarial slicing (Ad2S) scheme for networks with invarying channel statistics. To track the network channel variations, we also propose a measurement extrapolation-Kalman filter (ME-KF)-based method and refine our scheme into Ad2S-non-stationary refinement (Ad2S-NR). Through extended numerical examples, we demonstrate that our proposed schemes achieve 3.86 Mbps throughput improvement and 63.96% latency reduction with 24.36% convergence time reduction. Within our framework, the trade-off between total throughput and user service experience can be achieved by tuning systematic parameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[High Dimensional Ensemble Kalman Filter](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00283v2)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF), as a fundamental data assimilation approach, has been widely used in many fields of earth science, engineering and beyond. However, several theoretical aspects of the EnKF remain unknown, especially when the state variable is of high dimensional accompanied with high resolution observation and physical models. This paper first proposes several high dimensional EnKF (HD-EnKF) methods that provide consistent estimators for the important forecast error covariance and the Kalman gain matrix. It then studies the theoretical properties of the EnKF under both the fixed and high dimensional state variables, which provides the mean square errors of the analysis states to the underlying oracle states offered by the Kalman filter and gives the much needed insight into the roles played by the forecast error covariance on the accuracy of the EnKF. The accuracy of the data assimilation under the misspecified physical model is also considered. Numerical studies on the Lorenz-96 and the Shallow Water Equation models illustrate that the proposed HD-EnKF algorithms perform better than the standard EnKF methods as they provide more robust and accurate assimilated results. The HD-EnKF was applied to assimilate sea temperature in the Northwest Pacific, which showed more accurate out-sample performances than the existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[MARS: Defending Unmanned Aerial Vehicles From Attacks on Inertial Sensors with Model-based Anomaly Detection and Recovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00924v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) rely on measurements from Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) to maintain stable flight. However, IMUs are susceptible to physical attacks, including acoustic resonant and electromagnetic interference attacks, resulting in immediate UAV crashes. Consequently, we introduce a Model-based Anomaly detection and Recovery System (MARS) that enables UAVs to quickly detect adversarial attacks on inertial sensors and achieve dynamic flight recovery. MARS features an attack-resilient state estimator based on the Extended Kalman Filter, which incorporates position, velocity, heading, and rotor speed measurements to reconstruct accurate attitude and angular velocity information for UAV control. Moreover, a statistical anomaly detection system monitors IMU sensor data, raising a system-level alert if an attack is detected. Upon receiving the alert, a multi-stage dynamic flight recovery strategy suspends the ongoing mission, stabilizes the drone in a hovering condition, and then resumes tasks under the resilient control. Experimental results in PX4 software-in-the-loop environments as well as real-world MARS-PX4 autopilot-equipped drones demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing IMU-defense frameworks, showcasing the ability of the UAVs to survive attacks and complete the missions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fault-Tolerant Multi-Modal Localization of Multi-Robots on Matrix Lie Groups](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00842v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Consistent localization of cooperative multi-robot systems during navigation presents substantial challenges. This paper proposes a fault-tolerant, multi-modal localization framework for multi-robot systems on matrix Lie groups. We introduce novel stochastic operations to perform composition, differencing, inversion, averaging, and fusion of correlated and non-correlated estimates on Lie groups, enabling pseudo-pose construction for filter updates. The method integrates a combination of proprioceptive and exteroceptive measurements from inertial, velocity, and pose (pseudo-pose) sensors on each robot in an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) framework. The prediction step is conducted on the Lie group $\mathbb{SE}_2(3) \times \mathbb{R}^3 \times \mathbb{R}^3$, where each robot's pose, velocity, and inertial measurement biases are propagated. The proposed framework uses body velocity, relative pose measurements from fiducial markers, and inter-robot communication to provide scalable EKF update across the network on the Lie group $\mathbb{SE}(3) \times \mathbb{R}^3$. A fault detection module is implemented, allowing the integration of only reliable pseudo-pose measurements from fiducial markers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method through experiments with a network of wheeled mobile robots equipped with inertial measurement units, wheel odometry, and ArUco markers. The comparison results highlight the proposed method's real-time performance, superior efficiency, reliability, and scalability in multi-robot localization, making it well-suited for large-scale robotic systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Visual Trajectory Prediction of Vessels for Inland Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00599v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The future of inland navigation increasingly relies on autonomous systems and remote operations, emphasizing the need for accurate vessel trajectory prediction. This study addresses the challenges of video-based vessel tracking and prediction by integrating advanced object detection methods, Kalman filters, and spline-based interpolation. However, existing detection systems often misclassify objects in inland waterways due to complex surroundings. A comparative evaluation of tracking algorithms, including BoT-SORT, Deep OC-SORT, and ByeTrack, highlights the robustness of the Kalman filter in providing smoothed trajectories. Experimental results from diverse scenarios demonstrate improved accuracy in predicting vessel movements, which is essential for collision avoidance and situational awareness. The findings underline the necessity of customized datasets and models for inland navigation. Future work will expand the datasets and incorporate vessel classification to refine predictions, supporting both autonomous systems and human operators in complex environments.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods often use threshold-based filtering for detection scores, which can fail for distant and occluded objects, leading to false positives. To tackle this, we propose a novel track validity mechanism and multi-stage observational gating process, significantly reducing ghost tracks and enhancing tracking performance. Our method achieves a $29.47\%$ improvement in Multi-Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) on the KITTI validation dataset with the Second detector. Additionally, a refined Kalman filter term reduces localization noise, improving higher-order tracking accuracy (HOTA) by $4.8\%$. The online framework, RobMOT, outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple detectors, with HOTA improvements of up to $3.92\%$ on the KITTI testing dataset and $8.7\%$ on the validation dataset, while achieving low identity switch scores. RobMOT excels in challenging scenarios, tracking distant objects and prolonged occlusions, with a $1.77\%$ MOTA improvement on the Waymo Open dataset, and operates at a remarkable 3221 FPS on a single CPU, proving its efficiency for real-time multi-object tracking.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a comprehensive framework -- what we believe to be the first capable of predicting instantaneous oxygen consumption (VO$_{2}$) trajectories exclusively from consumer-grade wearable data. Our approach employs two complementary physiological models: (1) accurate modeling of heart rate (HR) dynamics via a physiologically constrained ordinary differential equation (ODE) and neural Kalman filter, trained on over 3 million HR observations, achieving 1-second interval predictions with mean absolute errors as low as 2.81\,bpm (correlation 0.87); and (2) leveraging the principles of precise HR modeling, a novel VO$_{2}$ prediction architecture requiring only the initial second of VO$_{2}$ data for calibration, enabling robust, sequence-to-sequence metabolic demand estimation. Despite relying solely on smartwatch and chest-strap data, our method achieves mean absolute percentage errors of approximately 13\%, effectively capturing rapid physiological transitions and steady-state conditions across diverse running intensities. Our synchronized dataset, complemented by blood lactate measurements, further lays the foundation for future noninvasive metabolic zone identification. By embedding physiological constraints within modern machine learning, this framework democratizes advanced metabolic monitoring, bridging laboratory-grade accuracy and everyday accessibility, thus empowering both elite athletes and recreational fitness enthusiasts.</p></details> |  |

Therefore, we present Water-DSLAM, a novel laser-aided multi-sensor fusion system that can achieve uninterrupted, fault-tolerant dense SLAM capable of continuous in-situ observation in diverse complex underwater scenarios through three key innovations: Firstly, we develop Water-Scanner, a multi-sensor fusion robotic platform featuring a self-designed Underwater Binocular Structured Light (UBSL) module that enables high-precision 3D perception. Secondly, we propose a fault-tolerant triple-subsystem architecture combining: 1) DP-INS (DVL- and Pressure-aided Inertial Navigation System): fusing inertial measurement unit, doppler velocity log, and pressure sensor based Error-State Kalman Filter (ESKF) to provide high-frequency absolute odometry 2) Water-UBSL: a novel Iterated ESKF (IESKF)-based tight coupling between UBSL and DP-INS to mitigate UBSL's degeneration issues 3) Water-Stereo: a fusion of DP-INS and stereo camera for accurate initialization and tracking. Thirdly, we introduce a multi-modal factor graph back-end that dynamically fuses heterogeneous sensor data. The proposed multi-sensor factor graph maintenance strategy efficiently addresses issues caused by asynchronous sensor frequencies and partial data loss. Experimental results demonstrate Water-DSLAM achieves superior robustness (0.039 m trajectory RMSE and 100\% continuity ratio during partial sensor dropout) and dense mapping (6922.4 points/m^3 in 750 m^3 water volume, approximately 10 times denser than existing methods) in various challenging environments, including pools, dark underwater scenes, 16-meter-deep sinkholes, and field rivers.

The proposed methods, named E-InEKF and E-IS, fuse kinematics, IMU, LiDAR, and GPS data to mitigate position drift, particularly along the z-axis, a common issue in proprioceptive-based approaches. We derived observation models that satisfy group-affine properties to integrate LiDAR odometry and GPS into InEKF and IS. LiDAR odometry is incorporated using Iterative Closest Point (ICP) registration on a parallel thread, preserving the computational efficiency of proprioceptive-based state estimation. We evaluate E-InEKF and E-IS with and without exteroceptive sensors, benchmarking them against LiDAR-based odometry methods in indoor and outdoor experiments using the KAIST HOUND2 robot. Our methods achieve lower Relative Position Errors (RPE) and significantly reduce Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE), with improvements of up to 28% indoors and 40% outdoors compared to LIO-SAM and FAST-LIO2. Additionally, we compare E-InEKF and E-IS in terms of computational efficiency and accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters</p></details> |

In this paper, we developed an adaptive neural unscented Kalman filter to cope with time-varying uncertainties during platform operation. To this end, we devised ProcessNet, a simple yet efficient end-to-end regression network to adaptively estimate the process noise covariance matrix. We focused on the nonlinear inertial sensor and Doppler velocity log fusion problem in the case of autonomous underwater vehicle navigation.

| **[DiSK: Differentially Private Optimizer with Simplified Kalman Filter for Noise Reduction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03883v2)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differential privacy (DP) offers a robust framework for safeguarding individual data privacy. To utilize DP in training modern machine learning models, differentially private optimizers have been widely used in recent years. A popular approach to privatize an optimizer is to clip the individual gradients and add sufficiently large noise to the clipped gradient. This approach led to the development of DP optimizers that have comparable performance with their non-private counterparts in fine-tuning tasks or in tasks with a small number of training parameters. However, a significant performance drop is observed when these optimizers are applied to large-scale training. This degradation stems from the substantial noise injection required to maintain DP, which disrupts the optimizer's dynamics. This paper introduces DiSK, a novel framework designed to significantly enhance the performance of DP optimizers. DiSK employs Kalman filtering, a technique drawn from control and signal processing, to effectively denoise privatized gradients and generate progressively refined gradient estimations. To ensure practicality for large-scale training, we simplify the Kalman filtering process, minimizing its memory and computational demands. We establish theoretical privacy-utility trade-off guarantees for DiSK, and demonstrate provable improvements over standard DP optimizers like DPSGD in terms of iteration complexity upper-bound. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks, including vision tasks such as CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k and language fine-tuning tasks such as GLUE, E2E, and DART, validate the effectiveness of DiSK. The results showcase its ability to significantly improve the performance of DP optimizers, surpassing state-of-the-art results under the same privacy constraints on several benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic linear regression models for forecasting time series with semi long memory errors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09096v2)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic linear regression models forecast the values of a time series based on a linear combination of a set of exogenous time series while incorporating a time series process for the error term. This error process is often assumed to follow a stationary autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model, or its seasonal variants, which is unable to capture a long-range dependence structure (long memory) of the error process. We propose a novel dynamic linear regression model that incorporates the long-range dependence feature of the errors and show that the proposed error process may: (i) have a significant impact on the posterior uncertainty of the estimated regression parameters and (ii) improve the model's forecasting ability. We develop a Markov chain Monte Carlo method to fit general dynamic linear regression models based on a frequency domain approach that enables fast, asymptotically exact Bayesian inference for large datasets. We demonstrate that our approximate algorithm is faster than the traditional time domain approaches, such as the Kalman filter and the multivariate Gaussian likelihood, while producing a highly accurate approximation to the posterior. The method is illustrated in simulated examples and two energy forecasting applications.</p></details> |  |

HyperController optimizes hyperparameters quickly while also maintaining improvement of the reinforcement learning neural network, resulting in faster training and deployment. It achieves this by modeling the hyperparameter optimization problem as an unknown Linear Gaussian Dynamical System, which is a system with a state that linearly changes. It then learns an efficient representation of the hyperparameter objective function using the Kalman filter, which is the optimal one-step predictor for a Linear Gaussian Dynamical System. To demonstrate the performance of HyperController, it is applied as a hyperparameter optimizer during training of reinforcement learning neural networks on a variety of OpenAI Gymnasium environments. In four out of the five Gymnasium environments, HyperController achieves highest median reward during evaluation compared to other algorithms. The results exhibit the potential of HyperController for efficient and stable training of reinforcement learning neural networks.</p></details> |  |

The proposed QUPF-VIN technique is quaternion-based capturing the inherently nonlinear nature of true navigation kinematics. The filter fuses data from a low-cost inertial measurement unit (IMU) and landmark observations obtained via a vision sensor. The QUPF-VIN is implemented in discrete form to ensure seamless integration with onboard inertial sensing systems. Designed for robustness in GPS-denied environments, the proposed method has been validated through experiments with real-world dataset involving an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with a 6-axis IMU and a stereo camera, operating with 6 DoF. The numerical results demonstrate that the QUPF-VIN provides superior tracking accuracy compared to ground truth data. Additionally, a comparative analysis with a standard Kalman filter-based navigation technique further highlights the enhanced performance of the QUPF-VIN.</p></details> |  |

It optimizes traffic flow, facilitates human interaction, and ensures compliance with regulations. However, it faces the challenge of tracking pedestrians in the presence of occlusion. Existing methods overlook effects caused by abnormal detections during partial occlusion. Subsequently, these abnormal detections can lead to inaccurate motion estimation, unreliable appearance features, and unfair association. To address these issues, we propose an adaptive occlusion-aware multiple pedestrian tracker, OccluTrack, to mitigate the effects caused by partial occlusion. Specifically, we first introduce a plug-and-play abnormal motion suppression mechanism into the Kalman Filter to adaptively detect and suppress outlier motions caused by partial occlusion. Second, we develop a pose-guided re-identification (Re-ID) module to extract discriminative part features for partially occluded pedestrians. Last, we develop a new occlusion-aware association method towards fair Intersection over Union (IoU) and appearance embedding distance measurement for occluded pedestrians. Extensive evaluation results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on MOTChallenge and DanceTrack datasets. Particularly, the performance improvements on IDF1 and ID Switches, as well as visualized results, demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in multiple pedestrian tracking.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE T-ITS</p></details> |
| **[A Taylor Series Approach to Correction of Input Errors in Gaussian Process Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18463v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gaussian Processes (GPs) are widely recognized as powerful non-parametric models for regression and classification. Traditional GP frameworks predominantly operate under the assumption that the inputs are either accurately known or subject to zero-mean noise. However, several real-world applications such as mobile sensors have imperfect localization, leading to inputs with biased errors. These biases can typically be estimated through measurements collected over time using, for example, Kalman filters. To avoid recomputation of the entire GP model when better estimates of the inputs used in the training data become available, we introduce a technique for updating a trained GP model to incorporate updated estimates of the inputs. By leveraging the differentiability of the mean and covariance functions derived from the squared exponential kernel, a second-order correction algorithm is developed to update the trained GP models. Precomputed Jacobians and Hessians of kernels enable real-time refinement of the mean and covariance predictions. The efficacy of the developed approach is demonstrated using two simulation studies, with error analyses revealing improvements in both predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification.</p></details> |  |

Then, the possible outputs of the control system are traversed to update the prior probability in order to implement iterative detection. The simulation results show that the prior information can reduce the block error rate performance of communications to improve the root mean square error performance of controls.</p></details> | 5 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Learning Enhanced Ensemble Filters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17836v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The filtering distribution in hidden Markov models evolves according to the law of a mean-field model in state--observation space. The ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) approximates this mean-field model with an ensemble of interacting particles, employing a Gaussian ansatz for the joint distribution of the state and observation at each observation time. These methods are robust, but the Gaussian ansatz limits accuracy. This shortcoming is addressed by approximating the mean-field evolution using a novel form of neural operator taking probability distributions as input: a Measure Neural Mapping (MNM). A MNM is used to design a novel approach to filtering, the MNM-enhanced ensemble filter (MNMEF), which is defined in both the mean-fieldlimit and for interacting ensemble particle approximations. The ensemble approach uses empirical measures as input to the MNM and is implemented using the set transformer, which is invariant to ensemble permutation and allows for different ensemble sizes. The derivation of methods from a mean-field formulation allows a single parameterization of the algorithm to be deployed at different ensemble sizes. In practice fine-tuning of a small number of parameters, for specific ensemble sizes, further enhances the accuracy of the scheme. The promise of the approach is demonstrated by its superior root-mean-square-error performance relative to leading methods in filtering the Lorenz 96 and Kuramoto-Sivashinsky models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint submitted to Journal of Computational Physics</p></details> |

We design an interacting multiple-model Kalman filter (IMM-KF) that estimates the external force exerted on the robot and multiple possible contact modes. The method is invariant to any gait pattern design. Our approach leverages pseudo-measurement information of the external forces based on the robot dynamics and encoder information. Based on the estimated contact mode and external force, we design a reflex motion and an admittance controller for the swing leg to avoid collisions by adjusting the leg's reference motion. Additionally, we implement a force-adaptive model predictive controller to enhance balancing. Simulation ablatation studies and experiments show the efficacy of the approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Meta-Learning Online Dynamics Model Adaptation in Off-Road Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16923v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-speed off-road autonomous driving presents unique challenges due to complex, evolving terrain characteristics and the difficulty of accurately modeling terrain-vehicle interactions. While dynamics models used in model-based control can be learned from real-world data, they often struggle to generalize to unseen terrain, making real-time adaptation essential. We propose a novel framework that combines a Kalman filter-based online adaptation scheme with meta-learned parameters to address these challenges. Offline meta-learning optimizes the basis functions along which adaptation occurs, as well as the adaptation parameters, while online adaptation dynamically adjusts the onboard dynamics model in real time for model-based control. We validate our approach through extensive experiments, including real-world testing on a full-scale autonomous off-road vehicle, demonstrating that our method outperforms baseline approaches in prediction accuracy, performance, and safety metrics, particularly in safety-critical scenarios. Our results underscore the effectiveness of meta-learned dynamics model adaptation, advancing the development of reliable autonomous systems capable of navigating diverse and unseen environments.

| **[Data-Assimilated Model-Based Reinforcement Learning for Partially Observed Chaotic Flows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16588v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The goal of many applications in energy and transport sectors is to control turbulent flows. However, because of chaotic dynamics and high dimensionality, the control of turbulent flows is exceedingly difficult. Model-free reinforcement learning (RL) methods can discover optimal control policies by interacting with the environment, but they require full state information, which is often unavailable in experimental settings. We propose a data-assimilated model-based RL (DA-MBRL) framework for systems with partial observability and noisy measurements. Our framework employs a control-aware Echo State Network for data-driven prediction of the dynamics, and integrates data assimilation with an Ensemble Kalman Filter for real-time state estimation. An off-policy actor-critic algorithm is employed to learn optimal control strategies from state estimates. The framework is tested on the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, demonstrating its effectiveness in stabilizing a spatiotemporally chaotic flow from noisy and partial measurements.</p></details> |  |
| **[SonarT165: A Large-scale Benchmark and STFTrack Framework for Acoustic Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15609v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Underwater observation systems typically integrate optical cameras and imaging sonar systems. When underwater visibility is insufficient, only sonar systems can provide stable data, which necessitates exploration of the underwater acoustic object tracking (UAOT) task. Previous studies have explored traditional methods and Siamese networks for UAOT. However, the absence of a unified evaluation benchmark has significantly constrained the value of these methods. To alleviate this limitation, we propose the first large-scale UAOT benchmark, SonarT165, comprising 165 square sequences, 165 fan sequences, and 205K high-quality annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that SonarT165 reveals limitations in current state-of-the-art SOT trackers. To address these limitations, we propose STFTrack, an efficient framework for acoustic object tracking. It includes two novel modules, a multi-view template fusion module (MTFM) and an optimal trajectory correction module (OTCM). The MTFM module integrates multi-view feature of both the original image and the binary image of the dynamic template, and introduces a cross-attention-like layer to fuse the spatio-temporal target representations. The OTCM module introduces the acoustic-response-equivalent pixel property and proposes normalized pixel brightness response scores, thereby suppressing suboptimal matches caused by inaccurate Kalman filter prediction boxes. To further improve the model feature, STFTrack introduces a acoustic image enhancement method and a Frequency Enhancement Module (FEM) into its tracking pipeline. Comprehensive experiments show the proposed STFTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance on the proposed benchmark. The code is available at https://github.com/LiYunfengLYF/SonarT165.</p></details> |  |
| **[Explicit Ensemble Mean Clock Synchronization for Optimal Atomic Time Scale Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15540v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel theoretical framework for atomic time scale generation, called explicit ensemble mean synchronization, which unifies clock synchronization and time scale generation within a control-theoretic paradigm. By exploiting an observable canonical decomposition of a standard atomic clock ensemble model, the system is decomposed into two complementary components: the observable part, which represents the synchronization deviation, and the unobservable part, which captures the synchronization destination. Within this structure, we mathematically prove that standard Kalman filtering, widely used in current time scale generation, can be interpreted as a special case of the proposed framework that optimizes long-term frequency stability in terms of the Allan variance. Furthermore, by applying appropriate state feedback control to each component based on the Kalman filtering, both clock synchronization and optimal time scale generation are achieved within a unified framework. This framework provides a principled basis for robust timekeeping systems that goes beyond conventional approaches in both scope and performance.</p></details> |  |

It tackles the problem of intermediate state estimation when external localization is unavailable or in the event of a sensor outage. The proposed observer comprises two nonlinear observers based on a recently developed iteratively preconditioned gradient descent (IPG) algorithm. It takes the inputs via an IMU preintegration model where the first observer is a quaternion-based IPG. The output for the first observer is the input for the second observer, estimating the velocity and, consequently, the position. The proposed observer is validated on a public underwater dataset and a real-world experiment using our robot platform. The estimation is compared with an extended Kalman filter (EKF) and an invariant extended Kalman filter (InEKF). Results demonstrate that our method outperforms these methods regarding better positional accuracy and lower variance.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICRA ...</summary><p>ICRA 2025 (International Conference on Robotics and Automation), Atlanta, USA</p></details> |

This task is particularly relevant in control applications, whenever real-time and robust estimation of dynamic cost/reward functions in safety critical settings has to be performed. In this paper, we,adopt a finite-dimensional approximation of a Gaussian Process, corresponding to a Bayesian linear regression in an appropriate feature space, and propose a new algorithm, DistKP, to track the time-varying coefficients via a distributed Kalman filter. The proposed method works for arbitrary kernels and under weaker assumptions on the time-evolution of the function to learn compared to the literature. We validate our results using a simulation example in which a fleet of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) learns a dynamically changing wind field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Note:...</summary><p>Note: This paper has been accepted for presentation at the 2025 European Control Conference (ECC)</p></details> |
| **[A novel real-time aeroelastic hybrid simulation system of section model wind tunnel testing based on adaptive extended Kalman filter](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20063v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Elastically-supported section model tests are the most basic experimental technique in wind engineering, where helical springs are commonly employed to simulate the two-degree-of-freedom low-order modal motions of flexible structures. However, the traditional technique has intrinsic limitations in accurately modeling nonlinear structural behaviors and accurate adjustments of nonlinear structural damping. This study proposes a novel Real-Time Aeroelastic Hybrid Simulation system for section model wind tunnel tests by integrating an active control algorithm of adaptive Kalman filter. The proposed system enables the simulation of nonlinear heave-transverse-torsion coupled vibrations of a section model under the action of the oncoming wind. The structural properties, i.g. mass, damping and stiffness, are numerically simulated via an active control system, and the aerodynamic forces are physically modelled via the model-wind interaction in the wind tunnel. To validate the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed RTAHS system, a MATLAB/Simulink-FLUENT/UDF co-simulation framework is developed. Numerical verification results indicate that the proposed algorithm effectively estimates the motion responses in both linear and nonlinear scenarios.</p></details> | 25 pages, 13figures |

Deep Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) methods based on maximum entropy principles show promise in recovering adversaries' goals but are typically offline, require large batch sizes with gradient descent, and rely on first-order updates, limiting their applicability in real-time scenarios. We propose an online Recursive Deep Inverse Reinforcement Learning (RDIRL) approach to recover the cost function governing the adversary actions and goals. Specifically, we minimize an upper bound on the standard Guided Cost Learning (GCL) objective using sequential second-order Newton updates, akin to the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), leading to a fast (in terms of convergence) learning algorithm. We demonstrate that RDIRL is able to recover cost and reward functions of expert agents in standard and adversarial benchmark tasks. Experiments on benchmark tasks show that our proposed approach outperforms several leading IRL algorithms.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present a real-time technique for driver eye state detection. First, the face is detected, and the eyes are located within the face region for tracking. A normalized cross-correlation-based online dynamic template matching technique, combined with Kalman filter tracking, is proposed to track the detected eye positions in subsequent image frames. A support vector machine with histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) features is used to classify the state of the eyes as open or closed.

This dataset comprises 217 minutes of flight time over 36 experiments using three quadcopters, collecting ultra-wideband (UWB) ranging data such as the raw timestamps and channel-impulse response data, vision data from a stereo camera and a bottom-facing monocular camera, inertial measurement unit data, height measurements from a laser rangefinder, magnetometer data, and ground-truth poses from a motion-capture system. The UWB data is collected from up to 12 transceivers affixed to mobile robots and static tripods in both line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight conditions. The UAVs fly at a maximum speed of 4.418 m/s in an indoor environment with visual fiducial markers as features. MILUV is versatile and can be used for a wide range of applications beyond localization, but the primary purpose of MILUV is for testing and validating multi-robot UWB- and vision-based localization algorithms. The dataset can be downloaded at https://doi.org/10.25452/figshare.plus.28386041.v1.

| **[Denoising and Reconstruction of Nonlinear Dynamics using Truncated Reservoir Computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13355v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Measurements acquired from distributed physical systems are often sparse and noisy. Therefore, signal processing and system identification tools are required to mitigate noise effects and reconstruct unobserved dynamics from limited sensor data. However, this process is particularly challenging because the fundamental equations governing the dynamics are largely unavailable in practice. Reservoir Computing (RC) techniques have shown promise in efficiently simulating dynamical systems through an unstructured and efficient computation graph comprising a set of neurons with random connectivity. However, the potential of RC to operate in noisy regimes and distinguish noise from the primary dynamics of the system has not been fully explored. This paper presents a novel RC method for noise filtering and reconstructing nonlinear dynamics, offering a novel learning protocol associated with hyperparameter optimization. The performance of the RC in terms of noise intensity, noise frequency content, and drastic shifts in dynamical parameters are studied in two illustrative examples involving the nonlinear dynamics of the Lorenz attractor and adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire system (AdEx). It is shown that the denoising performance improves via truncating redundant nodes and edges of the computing reservoir, as well as properly optimizing the hyperparameters, e.g., the leakage rate, the spectral radius, the input connectivity, and the ridge regression parameter. Furthermore, the presented framework shows good generalization behavior when tested for reconstructing unseen attractors from the bifurcation diagram. Compared to the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), the presented RC framework yields competitive accuracy at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and high-frequency ranges.</p></details> |  |

We propose the use of an extended Kalman filter (EKF) to smooth the gaze data collected during eye-tracking experiments, and systematically explore the interaction of different system parameters. Our results demonstrate that the EKF significantly reduces noise, leading to a marked improvement in tracking accuracy. Furthermore, we show that our proposed stochastic nonlinear dynamical model aligns well with real experimental data and holds promise for applications in related fields.</p></details> | 9 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Spike-Kal: A Spiking Neuron Network Assisted Kalman Filter](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12703v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Kalman filtering can provide an optimal estimation of the system state from noisy observation data. This algorithm's performance depends on the accuracy of system modeling and noise statistical characteristics, which are usually challenging to obtain in practical applications. The powerful nonlinear modeling capabilities of deep learning, combined with its ability to extract features from large amounts of data automatically, offer new opportunities for improving the Kalman filter. This paper proposes a novel method that leverages the Spiking Neural Network to optimize the Kalman filter. Our approach aims to reduce the reliance on prior knowledge of system and observation noises, allowing for adaptation to varying statistical characteristics of time-varying noise. Furthermore, we investigate the potential of SNNs in improving the computational efficiency of the Kalman filter. In our method, we design an integration strategy between the SNN and the Kalman filter. The SNN is trained to directly approximate the optimal gain matrix from observation data, thereby alleviating the computational burden of complex matrix operations inherent in traditional Kalman filtering while maintaining the accuracy and robustness of state estimation. Its average error has been reduced by 18\%-65\% compared with other methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prognosis Of Lithium-Ion Battery Health with Hybrid EKF-CNN+LSTM Model Using Differential Capacity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13956v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Battery degradation is a major challenge in electric vehicles (EV) and energy storage systems (ESS). However, most degradation investigations focus mainly on estimating the state of charge (SOC), which fails to accurately interpret the cells' internal degradation mechanisms. Differential capacity analysis (DCA) focuses on the rate of change of cell voltage about the change in cell capacity, under various charge/discharge rates. This paper developed a battery cell degradation testing model that used two types of lithium-ions (Li-ion) battery cells, namely lithium nickel cobalt aluminium oxides (LiNiCoAlO2) and lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4), to evaluate internal degradation during loading conditions. The proposed battery degradation model contains distinct charge rates (DCR) of 0.2C, 0.5C, 1C, and 1.5C, as well as discharge rates (DDR) of 0.5C, 0.9C, 1.3C, and 1.6C to analyze the internal health and performance of battery cells during slow, moderate, and fast loading conditions. Besides, this research proposed a model that incorporates the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to validate experimental data. The proposed model yields excellent modelling results based on mean squared error (MSE), and root mean squared error (RMSE), with errors of less than 0.001% at DCR and DDR. The peak identification technique (PIM) has been utilized to investigate battery health based on the number of peaks, peak position, peak height, peak area, and peak width. At last, the PIM method has discovered that the cell aged gradually under normal loading rates but deteriorated rapidly under fast loading conditions. Overall, LiFePO4 batteries perform more robustly and consistently than (LiNiCoAlO2) cells under varying loading conditions.</p></details> | 20pages, 19 figures |
| **[Efficient Transformed Gaussian Process State-Space Models for Non-Stationary High-Dimensional Dynamical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18309v2)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gaussian process state-space models (GPSSMs) offer a principled framework for learning and inference in nonlinear dynamical systems with uncertainty quantification. However, existing GPSSMs are limited by the use of multiple independent stationary Gaussian processes (GPs), leading to prohibitive computational and parametric complexity in high-dimensional settings and restricted modeling capacity for non-stationary dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient transformed Gaussian process state-space model (ETGPSSM) for scalable and flexible modeling of high-dimensional, non-stationary dynamical systems. Specifically, our ETGPSSM integrates a single shared GP with input-dependent normalizing flows, yielding an expressive implicit process prior that captures complex, non-stationary transition dynamics while significantly reducing model complexity. For the inference of the implicit process, we develop a variational inference algorithm that jointly approximates the posterior over the underlying GP and the neural network parameters defining the normalizing flows. To avoid explicit variational parameterization of the latent states, we further incorporate the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) into the variational framework, enabling accurate and efficient state estimation. Extensive empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our ETGPSSM in system dynamics learning, high-dimensional state estimation, and time-series forecasting, outperforming existing GPSSMs and neural network-based SSMs in terms of computational efficiency and accuracy.</p></details> | 13 pages, 6 figures |

With the developed EnKF-HOS-CMI method, the observation data for wave, ship, or both can be incorporated into the model, therefore producing the optimal analysis results. The developed method is validated and tested based on a synthetic problem on the motions of an irregular wave field and a box-shaped free-floating ship. We show that the EnKF-HOS-CMI method achieves much higher accuracy in the long-term simulation of nonlinear phase-resolved wave field and ship motion in comparison with the HOS-CMI method. Also, the ship parameters are estimated accurately by using a parameter-augmented state space in EnKF.</p></details> |  |

The state vector consists of a recurrent set of position control points and orientation control point increments, enabling a straightforward modification of the iterated extended Kalman filter without involving the error-state formulation. The resulting recursive spline estimator (RESPLE) provides a versatile, pragmatic and lightweight solution for motion estimation and is further exploited for direct LiDAR-based odometry, supporting integration of one or multiple LiDARs and an IMU. We conduct extensive real-world benchmarking based on public datasets and own experiments, covering aerial, wheeled, legged, and wearable platforms operating in indoor, urban, wild environments with diverse LiDARs. RESPLE-based solutions achieve superior estimation accuracy and robustness over corresponding state-of-the-art systems, while attaining real-time performance. Notably, our LiDAR-only variant outperforms existing LiDAR-inertial systems in scenarios without significant LiDAR degeneracy, and showing further improvements when additional LiDAR and inertial sensors are incorporated for more challenging conditions.

Despite the similarity of this problem to standard linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control, we show that when the observation model is bilinear, neither does the Separation Principle hold, nor is the optimal controller affine in the estimated state. Moreover, the cost-to-go is non-convex in the control input. Hence, finding an analytical expression for the optimal feedback controller is difficult in general. Under certain settings, we show that the standard LQG controller locally maximizes the cost instead of minimizing it. Furthermore, the optimal controllers (derived analytically) are not unique and are nonlinear in the estimated state. We also introduce a notion of input-dependent observability and derive conditions under which the Kalman filter covariance remains bounded. We illustrate our theoretical results through numerical experiments in multiple synthetic settings.</p></details> |  |

The models incorporate mass balance equations and are fitted using a modified Kalman filter for linear cases and the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) for nonlinear cases. Using Cu and Cr as representative elements, we assess the sensitivity of model predictions to measurement noise in key process variables, including steel mass, steel composition, scrap input mass, slag mass, and iron oxide fraction in slag. Results show that the models are robust to moderate noise levels in most variables, particularly when errors are below $10\%$. However, accuracy significantly deteriorates with noise in slag mass estimation. These findings highlight the practical feasibility and limitations of applying state space models for real-time scrap composition estimation in industrial settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Simultaneous Input and State Estimation under Output Quantization: A Gaussian Mixture approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09711v1)** | 2025-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simultaneous Input and State Estimation (SISE) enables the reconstruction of unknown inputs and internal states in dynamical systems, with applications in fault detection, robotics, and control. While various methods exist for linear systems, extensions to systems with output quantization are scarce, and formal connections to limit Kalman filters in this context are lacking. This work addresses these gaps by proposing a novel SISE algorithm for linear systems with quantized output measurements that is based on a Gaussian mixture model formulation. The observation model is represented as a Gaussian sum density, leading to closed-form recursive equations in the form of a Gaussian sum filter. In the absence of input prior knowledge, the recursions converge to a limit-case SISE algorithm, implementable as a bank of linear SISE filters running in parallel. A simulation example is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p></details> | 6 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Nash Equilibrium Between Consumer Electronic Devices and DoS Attacker for Distributed IoT-enabled RSE Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09415v1)** | 2025-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In electronic consumer Internet of Things (IoT), consumer electronic devices as edge devices require less computational overhead and the remote state estimation (RSE) of consumer electronic devices is always at risk of denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Therefore, the adversarial strategy between consumer electronic devices and DoS attackers is critical. This paper focuses on the adversarial strategy between consumer electronic devices and DoS attackers in IoT-enabled RSE Systems. We first propose a remote joint estimation model for distributed measurements to effectively reduce consumer electronic device workload and minimize data leakage risks. The Kalman filter is deployed on the remote estimator, and the DoS attacks with open-loop as well as closed-loop are considered. We further introduce advanced reinforcement learning techniques, including centralized and distributed Minimax-DQN, to address high-dimensional decision-making challenges in both open-loop and closed-loop scenarios. Especially, the Q-network instead of the Q-table is used in the proposed approaches, which effectively solves the challenge of Q-learning. Moreover, the proposed distributed Minimax-DQN reduces the action space to expedite the search for Nash Equilibrium (NE). The experimental results validate that the proposed model can expeditiously restore the RSE error covariance to a stable state in the presence of DoS attacks, exhibiting notable attack robustness. The proposed centralized and distributed Minimax-DQN effectively resolves the NE in both open and closed-loop case, showcasing remarkable performance in terms of convergence. It reveals that substantial advantages in both efficiency and stability are achieved compared with the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling Scrap Composition in Electric Arc and Basic Oxygen Furnaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09382v1)** | 2025-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This article aims to determine the composition of scrap (recycled material) used in an Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) or basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF) based on the assumption of mass balance. Accurate knowledge of this composition can increase the usage of recycled material to produce steel, reducing the need for raw ore extraction and minimizing environmental impact by conserving natural resources and lowering carbon emissions. The study develops two models to describe the behavior of elements in the EAF or BOF process. A linear state space model is used for elements transferring completely from scrap to steel, while a non-linear state space model is applied to elements moving into both steel and slag. The Kalman filter and unscented Kalman filter are employed to approximate these models, respectively. Importantly, the models leverage only data already collected as part of the standard production process, avoiding the need for additional measurements that are often costly. This article outlines the formulation of both models, the algorithms used, and discusses the hyperparameters involved. We provide practical suggestions on how to choose appropriate hyperparameters based on expert knowledge and historical data. The models are applied to real BOF data. Cu and Cr are chosen as examples for linear and non-linear models, respectively. The results show that both models can reconstruct the composition of scrap for these elements.

| **[Stochastic Claims Reserving Using State Space Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09292v1)** | 2025-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Claims reserving, also known as Incurred But Not Reported (IBNR) claims prediction, is an important issue in general insurance. State space modeling is widely recognized as a statistically robust method for addressing this problem. In state space model-based claims reserving, the Kalman filter and Kalman smoother algorithms are employed for model fitting, diagnostics, and deriving reserve estimates. Additionally, the simulation smoother algorithm is used to obtain the sampling distribution of the derived reserve estimate. The integration of these three algorithms results in an elegant and transparent claim reserving process. Various state space models (SSMs) have been proposed in the literature for claims reserving. This article outlines a step-by-step process for computing the SSM-based reserve estimate and its associated sampling distribution for any proposed SSM. A brief discussion on model selection is also included. The claims reserving computations are demonstrated using a real-life data set. The state space modeling computations in the illustrations are performed by using the CSSM procedure in SAS Viya/Econometrics software. The SAS code for reproducing the output in the illustrations is provided in the supplementary material.</p></details> |  |

We consider linear, discrete-time systems augmented by a bounded nonlinear function of the state. For such systems, we review 1-step and N-step versions of the UTC. Using a Lyapunov-based analysis, we prove that the states and inputs converge to a bounded ball around the origin, whose radius depends on the bound on the nonlinearity. Using examples of a fighter jet model and a quadcopter, we demonstrate that the UTC achieves satisfactory regulation and tracking performance on these nonlinear models.</p></details> | 6 pages, 4 figures |

Since such datasets are often incomplete and noisy, it is useful to create the prediction surface of a spatial field. To this end, we consider an online filtering inference by using the Kalman filter based on linear Gaussian state-space models. However, the Kalman filter is impractically time-consuming when the number of locations in spatio-temporal datasets is large. To address this problem, we propose a multi-resolution filter via linear projection (MRF-lp), a fast computation method for online filtering inference. In the MRF-lp, by carrying out a multi-resolution approximation via linear projection (MRA-lp), the forecast covariance matrix can be approximated while capturing both the large- and small-scale spatial variations. As a result of this approximation, our proposed MRF-lp preserves a block-sparse structure of some matrices appearing in the MRF-lp through time, which leads to the scalability of this algorithm. Additionally, we discuss extensions of the MRF-lp to a nonlinear and non-Gaussian case. Simulation studies and real data analysis for total precipitable water vapor demonstrate that our proposed approach performs well compared with the related methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>44 pa...</summary><p>44 pages, 10 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

In such scenarios, adversaries compromise the system by injecting false data or blocking measurement transmissions via denial-of-service attacks, distorting sensor readings. This paper develops a Kalman filter and Rauch--Tung--Striebel (RTS) smoother for linear stochastic state-space models subject to cyber-attacked measurements. We approximate the faulty measurement model via generalized statistical linear regression (GSLR). The GSLR-based approximated measurement model is then used to develop a Kalman filter and RTS smoother for the problem. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms under cyber-attacks is demonstrated through a simulated aircraft tracking experiment.</p></details> | 5 pages, 4 figures |

IEEE 802.11be (Wi-Fi 7) features multi-link operation (MLO) with multi-link device (MLD) hosting multiple interfaces, highlighting enhanced multi-link single-radio (EMLSR) operation. IEEE 802.11bf features Wi-Fi sensing, enabling integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) in Wi-Fi. In this paper, we pioneer an innovative combination of EMLSR operation and ISAC functionality, considering target tracking with ISAC using EMLSR in IEEE 802.11 WLANs. We establish a unique scenario where AP MLD needs to make ISAC decision and STA MLD selection when its interface gains a transmit opportunity (TXOP). Then, we present key design principles: ISAC decision involves the Kalman filter for target state and a developed time-based strategy for sensing/communications determination, while STA MLD selection involves a Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB)-based trilateration performance metric along with a developed candidate strategy for UL sensing and involves a developed weighted proportional fairness-aware heuristic strategy for DL communications. We propose novel non-cooperative and cooperative approaches, where each interface leverages its own information and aggregate information across all interfaces, respectively. For proposed non-cooperative and cooperative approaches, simulation results exhibit their tradeoff and superiority about sensing and communications.</p></details> | 13 pages, 11 figures |

Radar-Inertial Odometry (RIO) has emerged as a promising solution due to its resilience in such environments. In this paper, we present RINO, a non-iterative RIO framework implemented in an adaptively loosely coupled manner. Building upon ORORA as the baseline for radar odometry, RINO introduces several key advancements, including improvements in keypoint extraction, motion distortion compensation, and pose estimation via an adaptive voting mechanism. This voting strategy facilitates efficient polynomial-time optimization while simultaneously quantifying the uncertainty in the radar module's pose estimation. The estimated uncertainty is subsequently integrated into the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation within a Kalman filter framework. Unlike prior loosely coupled odometry systems, RINO not only retains the global and robust registration capabilities of the radar component but also dynamically accounts for the real-time operational state of each sensor during fusion. Experimental results conducted on publicly available datasets demonstrate that RINO reduces translation and rotation errors by 1.06% and 0.09{\deg}/100m, respectively, when compared to the baseline method, thus significantly enhancing its accuracy. Furthermore, RINO achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

The posterior attitude distribution is proven to be a matrix Fisher distribution with the assumption that non-unit vector measurement errors follow the isotropic Gaussian distributions and unit vector measurements follow the von-Mises Fisher distributions. Next, a global unscented transformation is proposed to approximate the full likelihood distribution with a matrix Fisher distribution for more generic cases of vector measurement errors following the non-isotropic Gaussian distributions. Following these, a Bayesian attitude estimator with the matrix Fisher distribution is constructed. Numerical examples are then presented. The proposed estimator exhibits advantageous performance compared with the previous attitude estimator with matrix Fisher distributions and the classic multiplicative extended Kalman filter in the case of non-unit vector measurements.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Transformer-Based Robust Underwater Inertial Navigation in Prolonged Doppler Velocity Log Outages](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07697v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) have a wide variety of applications in the marine domain, including exploration, surveying, and mapping. Their navigation systems rely heavily on fusing data from inertial sensors and a Doppler velocity log (DVL), typically via nonlinear filtering. The DVL estimates the AUV's velocity vector by transmitting acoustic beams to the seabed and analyzing the Doppler shift from the reflected signals. However, due to environmental challenges, DVL beams can deflect or fail in real-world settings, causing signal outages. In such cases, the AUV relies solely on inertial data, leading to accumulated navigation errors and mission terminations. To cope with these outages, we adopted ST-BeamsNet, a deep learning approach that uses inertial readings and prior DVL data to estimate AUV velocity during isolated outages. In this work, we extend ST-BeamsNet to address prolonged DVL outages and evaluate its impact within an extended Kalman filter framework. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework improves velocity RMSE by up to 63% and reduces final position error by up to 95% compared to pure inertial navigation. This is in scenarios involving up to 50 seconds of complete DVL outage.</p></details> | <details><summary>Eight...</summary><p>Eight pages, 7 Figures, 4 Tables</p></details> |

The formations found by minimizing the aggregated cost function are evaluated in a coverage path planning task in simulation and experiment, where the robots localize themselves and unknown landmarks using a simultaneous localization and mapping algorithm based on the extended Kalman filter. Compared to an optimal formation that maximizes ranging-based relative localization accuracy, these formations significantly reduce the time to cover a given area with minimal impact on relative pose estimation accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 9 figures, submitted to IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems 2024</p></details> |

Classical filtering approaches, such as the Kalman filter, can struggle when facing nonlinear dynamics or non-Gaussian noise, and even more flexible particle filters often encounter sample degeneracy or high computational costs in large-scale domains. Meanwhile, adaptive machine learning techniques, including Q-learning and neuroevolutionary algorithms such as NEAT, rely heavily on accurate state feedback to guide learning; when sensor data are imperfect, these methods suffer from degraded convergence and suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose an integrated framework that unifies particle filtering with Q-learning and NEAT to explicitly address the challenge of noisy measurements. By refining radar-based observations into reliable state estimates, our particle filter drives more stable policy updates (in Q-learning) or controller evolution (in NEAT), allowing both reinforcement learning and neuroevolution to converge faster, achieve higher returns or fitness, and exhibit greater resilience to sensor uncertainty. Experiments on grid-based navigation and a simulated car environment highlight consistent gains in training stability, final performance, and success rates over baselines lacking advanced filtering. Altogether, these findings underscore that accurate state estimation is not merely a preprocessing step, but a vital component capable of substantially enhancing adaptive machine learning in real-world applications plagued by sensor noise.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a non-invasive method for estimating output-line impedance using measurements local to the inverter. It provides a specific method for signal conditioning of signals measured at the inverter, which makes the measured data better suited to estimation algorithms. An algorithm based on the Variable Direction Forgetting Recursive Least Squares (VDF-RLS) method is introduced, which leverages these conditioned signals for precise impedance estimation. The signal conditioning process transforms measurements into the direct-quadrature (dq) coordinate frame, where the rotating frame frequency is determined to facilitate a simpler and more accurate estimation. This frequency is implemented using a secondary Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) to attenuate grid voltage measurement variations. By isolating the variation-sensitive q-axis and relying solely on the less sensitive d-axis, the method further minimizes the impact of variations. The VDF-RLS estimation method achieves rapid adaptation while ensuring stability in the absence of persistent excitation by selectively discarding outdated data during updates. Proposed conditioning and estimation methods are non-invasive; estimations are solely done using measured outputs, and no signal is injected into the power network. Simulation results demonstrate a significant improvement in impedance estimation stability, particularly in low-excitation conditions, where the VDF-RLS method achieves more than three time lower error compared to existing approaches such as constant forgetting RLS and the Kalman filter.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, 2 table, submitted for 2025 Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)</p></details> |

For the general time-varying case, a relationship between the error covariance and the observability Gramian is established. Utilizing this relationship, we demonstrate an intuition that the stability of a node is only related to the observability of those nodes that can reach it uniformly. For the periodic time-varying case, it is proved by a monotonicity analysis method that CI-based distributed Kalman filtering converges periodically for any initial condition. The convergent point is shown to be the unique positive definite solution to a Riccati-like equation. Additionally, by constructing an intermediate difference equation, the closed-loop transition matrix of the estimation error system is proved to be Schur stable. Notably, all theoretical results are obtained without requiring network connectivity assumptions. Finally, simulations verify the effectiveness of the stability results.</p></details> | 10 pages,4 figures |
| **[An Adaptive Method for Contextual Stochastic Multi-armed Bandits with Rewards Generated by a Linear Dynamical System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10418v2)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online decision-making can be formulated as the popular stochastic multi-armed bandit problem where a learner makes decisions (or takes actions) to maximize cumulative rewards collected from an unknown environment. This paper proposes to model a stochastic multi-armed bandit as an unknown linear Gaussian dynamical system, as many applications, such as bandits for dynamic pricing problems or hyperparameter selection for machine learning models, can benefit from this perspective. Following this approach, we can build a matrix representation of the system's steady-state Kalman filter that takes a set of previously collected observations from a time interval of length $s$ to predict the next reward that will be returned for each action. This paper proposes a solution in which the parameter $s$ is determined via an adaptive algorithm by analyzing the model uncertainty of the matrix representation. This algorithm helps the learner adaptively adjust its model size and its length of exploration based on the uncertainty of its environmental model. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is demonstrated through extensive numerical studies, revealing that the proposed scheme is capable of increasing the rate of collected cumulative rewards.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hybrid machine learning data assimilation for marine biogeochemistry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05218v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Marine biogeochemistry models are critical for forecasting, as well as estimating ecosystem responses to climate change and human activities. Data assimilation (DA) improves these models by aligning them with real-world observations, but marine biogeochemistry DA faces challenges due to model complexity, strong nonlinearity, and sparse, uncertain observations. Existing DA methods applied to marine biogeochemistry struggle to update unobserved variables effectively, while ensemble-based methods are computationally too expensive for high-complexity marine biogeochemistry models. This study demonstrates how machine learning (ML) can improve marine biogeochemistry DA by learning statistical relationships between observed and unobserved variables. We integrate ML-driven balancing schemes into a 1D prototype of a system used to forecast marine biogeochemistry in the North-West European Shelf seas. ML is applied to predict (i) state-dependent correlations from free-run ensembles and (ii), in an ``end-to-end'' fashion, analysis increments from an Ensemble Kalman Filter. Our results show that ML significantly enhances updates for previously not-updated variables when compared to univariate schemes akin to those used operationally. Furthermore, ML models exhibit moderate transferability to new locations, a crucial step toward scaling these methods to 3D operational systems. We conclude that ML offers a clear pathway to overcome current computational bottlenecks in marine biogeochemistry DA and that refining transferability, optimizing training data sampling, and evaluating scalability for large-scale marine forecasting, should be future research priorities.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 13 figures (10 in main text, 3 in appendix)</p></details> |

By reformulating the vehicle's dynamics and measurement models within a linear time-varying (LTV) framework, we enable the application of a linear Kalman filter, significantly simplifying observer design for inertial navigation systems (INS). A key strength of this approach lies in its generality: rather than relying on specific measurement modalities, our framework accommodates a broad class of exteroceptive measurements. To illustrate its effectiveness, we conduct a uniform observability (UO) analysis for two fundamental benchmark cases-GPS-aided INS and landmark-aided INS-deriving sufficient conditions that guarantee the global uniform exponential stability of the proposed filter. Simulations for both applications confirm the versatility and robustness of our approach.</p></details> | 8 pages |

Past works studying collective perception use either an entire robot swarm with perfect sensing or a swarm with only a handful of malfunctioning members. A related study proposed an algorithm that does account for an entire swarm of unreliable robots but assumes that the sensor faults are known and remain constant over time. To that end, we build on that study by proposing the Bayes Collective Perception Filter (BayesCPF) that enables robots with continuously degrading sensors to accurately estimate the fill ratio -- the rate at which an environmental feature occurs. Our main contribution is the Extended Kalman Filter within the BayesCPF, which helps swarm robots calibrate for their time-varying sensor degradation. We validate our method across different degradation models, initial conditions, and environments in simulated and physical experiments. Our findings show that, regardless of degradation model assumptions, fill ratio estimation using the BayesCPF is competitive to the case if the true sensor accuracy is known, especially when assumptions regarding the model and initial sensor accuracy levels are preserved.</p></details> | 20 pages, 14 figures |

This paper proposes a novel, centralized dynamic state estimator for power systems that lack models of some components. Including the available dynamic evolution equations, algebraic network equations, and phasor measurements, we apply the least squares criterion to estimate all dynamic and algebraic states recursively. The approach results in an algorithm that generalizes the iterated extended Kalman filter and does not require static network observability. We further derive a graph theoretic condition for placing phasor measurement units that guarantees the uniqueness of the solution. A numerical study evaluates the performance under short circuits in the network and load changes and shows superior tracking performance compared to robust procedures from the literature within computational times that are feasible for real-time application.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://gitlab.nccr-automation.ch/mkatanic/powerdynamicestimator</p></details> |
| **[An Exploration-free Method for a Linear Stochastic Bandit Driven by a Linear Gaussian Dynamical System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03926v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In stochastic multi-armed bandits, a major problem the learner faces is the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. Recently, exploration-free methods -- methods that commit to the action predicted to return the highest reward -- have been studied from the perspective of linear bandits. In this paper, we introduce a linear bandit setting where the reward is the output of a linear Gaussian dynamical system. Motivated by a problem encountered in hyperparameter optimization for reinforcement learning, where the number of actions is much higher than the number of training iterations, we propose Kalman filter Observability Dependent Exploration (KODE), an exploration-free method that utilizes the Kalman filter predictions to select actions. Our major contribution of this work is our analysis of the performance of the proposed method, which is dependent on the observability properties of the underlying linear Gaussian dynamical system. We evaluate KODE via two different metrics: regret, which is the cumulative expected difference between the highest possible reward and the reward sampled by KODE, and action alignment, which measures how closely KODE's chosen action aligns with the linear Gaussian dynamical system's state variable. To provide intuition on the performance, we prove that KODE implicitly encourages the learner to explore actions depending on the observability of the linear Gaussian dynamical system. This method is compared to several well-known stochastic multi-armed bandit algorithms to validate our theoretical results.</p></details> |  |

Coupling of renewable power supplies to water electrolysis processes is, however, challenging, as explosive gas mixtures (hydrogen in oxygen) might form at low loads. This has prompted research into gas purity control of such systems. While these attempts have shown to be successful in theoretical and practical studies, they are currently limited in that they only consider the gas purity at locations where composition measurements are available. As these locations are generally positioned downstream of the disturbance origin, this incurs considerable delays and can lead to undetected critical conditions. In this work, we propose the use of an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) in combination with a simple process model to estimate and control the gas composition at locations where measurements are not available. The model uses noise-driven states for the gas impurity and is hence agnostic towards any mechanistic disturbance model. We show in simulations that this simple approach performs well under various disturbance types and can reduce the time spent in potentially hazardous conditions by up to one order of magnitude.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 14th IFAC Symposium on Dynamics and Control of Process Systems, including Biosystems (DYCOPS 2025). 6 pages, 5 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

The dimension of the temporal measurement vector is lower than that of the temporal state vector to be estimated, leading to an under-determined inverse problem. The underlying dynamical model of the state's evolution is unknown for a 'model-free process.' Hence, it is difficult to use traditional model-driven methods, for example, Kalman and particle filters. Instead, we consider data-driven methods. We experimentally show that two existing unsupervised learning-based data-driven methods fail to address the BSCM problem in a model-free process. The methods are -- data-driven nonlinear state estimation (DANSE) and deep Markov model (DMM). While DANSE provides good predictive/forecasting performance to model the temporal measurement data as a time series, its unsupervised learning lacks suitable regularization for tackling the BSCM task. We then propose a semi-supervised learning approach and develop a semi-supervised learning-based DANSE method, referred to as SemiDANSE. In SemiDANSE, we use a large amount of unlabelled data along with a limited amount of labelled data, i.e., pairwise measurement-and-state data, which provides the desired regularization. Using three benchmark dynamical systems, we show that the data-driven SemiDANSE provides competitive state estimation performance for BSCM against a hybrid method called KalmanNet and two model-driven methods (extended Kalman filter and unscented Kalman filter) that know the dynamical models exactly.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, under review at IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing</p></details> |

The estimation of the latent model parameters is based on second-order properties of the count and underlying Gaussian time series, yielding estimators of the underlying covariance matrices for which standard principal component analysis applies. Theoretical consistency results are established for the proposed estimation, building on certain concentration results for the models of the type considered. They also involve the memory of the latent Gaussian process, quantified through a spectral gap, shown to be suitably bounded as the model dimension increases, which is of independent interest. In addition, novel cross-validation schemes are suggested for model selection. The forecasting is carried out through a particle-based sequential Monte Carlo, leveraging Kalman filtering techniques. A simulation study and an application are also considered.</p></details> |  |

We introduce three Neural Network (NN) models that address key challenges in MOT: (i) the Single-Prediction Network (SPENT) for trajectory prediction, (ii) the Single-Association Network (SANT) for mapping individual Sensor Object (SO) to existing tracks, and (iii) the Multi-Association Network (MANTa) for associating multiple SOs to multiple tracks. These models are seamlessly integrated into a traditional Kalman Filter (KF) framework, maintaining the system's modularity by replacing relevant components without disrupting the overall architecture. Importantly, all three networks are designed to be run in a realtime, embedded environment. Each network contains less than 50k trainable parameters. Our evaluation, conducted on the public KITTI tracking dataset, demonstrates significant improvements in tracking performance. SPENT reduces the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) by 50% compared to a standard KF, while SANT and MANTa achieve up to 95% accuracy in sensor object-to-track assignments. These results underscore the effectiveness of incorporating task-specific NNs into traditional tracking systems, boosting performance and robustness while preserving modularity, maintainability, and interpretability.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods, including semantic graph approaches, often suffer from coarse geometric representations and lack temporal robustness against noise, dynamics, and viewpoint changes. We introduce PNE-SGAN, a Probabilistic NDT-Enhanced Semantic Graph Attention Network, to overcome these limitations. PNE-SGAN enhances semantic graphs by using Normal Distributions Transform (NDT) covariance matrices as rich, discriminative geometric node features, processed via a Graph Attention Network (GAT).

However, current Gaussian Splatting SLAM systems usually struggle with large scene representation and lack effective loop closure detection. To address these issues, we introduce NGM-SLAM, the first 3DGS based SLAM system that utilizes neural radiance field submaps for progressive scene expression, effectively integrating the strengths of neural radiance fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting. We utilize neural radiance field submaps as supervision and achieve high-quality scene expression and online loop closure adjustments through Gaussian rendering of fused submaps. Our results on multiple real-world scenes and large-scale scene datasets demonstrate that our method can achieve accurate hole filling and high-quality scene expression, supporting monocular, stereo, and RGB-D inputs, and achieving state-of-the-art scene reconstruction and tracking performance.</p></details> | 9pages, 4 figures |

Especially when HD maps are used, a precise and repeatable method has to be chosen. Therefore accurate map generation but also re-localization against these maps is necessary. Due to best 3D reconstruction of the surrounding, LiDAR has become a reliable modality for localization. The latest LiDAR odometry estimation are based on iterative closest point (ICP) approaches, namely KISS-ICP and SAGE-ICP. We extend the capabilities of KISS-ICP by incorporating semantic information into the point alignment process using a generalizable approach with minimal parameter tuning. This enhancement allows us to surpass KISS-ICP in terms of absolute trajectory error (ATE), the primary metric for map accuracy. Additionally, we improve the Cartographer mapping framework to handle semantic information. Cartographer facilitates loop closure detection over larger areas, mitigating odometry drift and further enhancing ATE accuracy. By integrating semantic information into the mapping process, we enable the filtering of specific classes, such as parked vehicles, from the resulting map. This filtering improves relocalization quality by addressing temporal changes, such as vehicles being moved.</p></details> |  |
| **[Autonomous Exploration-Based Precise Mapping for Mobile Robots through Stepwise and Consistent Motions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17005v1)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents an autonomous exploration framework. It is designed for indoor ground mobile robots that utilize laser Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), ensuring process completeness and precise mapping results. For frontier search, the local-global sampling architecture based on multiple Rapidly Exploring Random Trees (RRTs) is employed. Traversability checks during RRT expansion and global RRT pruning upon map updates eliminate unreachable frontiers, reducing potential collisions and deadlocks. Adaptive sampling density adjustments, informed by obstacle distribution, enhance exploration coverage potential. For frontier point navigation, a stepwise consistent motion strategy is adopted, wherein the robot strictly drives straight on approximately equidistant line segments in the polyline path and rotates in place at segment junctions. This simplified, decoupled motion pattern improves scan-matching stability and mitigates map drift. For process control, the framework serializes frontier point selection and navigation, avoiding oscillation caused by frequent goal changes in conventional parallelized processes. The waypoint retracing mechanism is introduced to generate repeated observations, triggering loop closure detection and backend optimization in graph-based SLAM, thereby improving map consistency and precision. Experiments in both simulation and real-world scenarios validate the effectiveness of the framework. It achieves improved mapping coverage and precision in more challenging environments compared to baseline 2D exploration algorithms. It also shows robustness in supporting resource-constrained robot platforms and maintaining mapping consistency across various LiDAR field-of-view (FoV) configurations.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 11 figures.

While research in urban environments has progressed significantly using LiDARs or cameras, applications in natural forest-like environments remain largely under-explored. Furthermore, forests present particular challenges due to high self-similarity and substantial variations in vegetation growth over time. In this work, we propose a robust LiDAR-based place recognition method for natural forests, ForestLPR. We hypothesize that a set of cross-sectional images of the forest's geometry at different heights contains the information needed to recognize revisiting a place. The cross-sectional images are represented by \ac{bev} density images of horizontal slices of the point cloud at different heights. Our approach utilizes a visual transformer as the shared backbone to produce sets of local descriptors and introduces a multi-BEV interaction module to attend to information at different heights adaptively. It is followed by an aggregation layer that produces a rotation-invariant place descriptor. We evaluated the efficacy of our method extensively on real-world data from public benchmarks as well as robotic datasets and compared it against the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. The results indicate that ForestLPR has consistently good performance on all evaluations and achieves an average increase of 7.38\% and 9.11\% on Recall@1 over the closest competitor on intra-sequence loop closure detection and inter-sequence re-localization, respectively, validating our hypothesis</p></details> | accepted by CVPR2025 |
| **[Large-Scale UWB Anchor Calibration and One-Shot Localization Using Gaussian Process](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16880v2)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ultra-wideband (UWB) is gaining popularity with devices like AirTags for precise home item localization but faces significant challenges when scaled to large environments like seaports. The main challenges are calibration and localization in obstructed conditions, which are common in logistics environments. Traditional calibration methods, dependent on line-of-sight (LoS), are slow, costly, and unreliable in seaports and warehouses, making large-scale localization a significant pain point in the industry. To overcome these challenges, we propose a UWB-LiDAR fusion-based calibration and one-shot localization framework. Our method uses Gaussian Processes to estimate anchor position from continuous-time LiDAR Inertial Odometry with sampled UWB ranges. This approach ensures accurate and reliable calibration with just one round of sampling in large-scale areas, I.e., 600x450 square meter. With the LoS issues, UWB-only localization can be problematic, even when anchor positions are known. We demonstrate that by applying a UWB-range filter, the search range for LiDAR loop closure descriptors is significantly reduced, improving both accuracy and speed. This concept can be applied to other loop closure detection methods, enabling cost-effective localization in large-scale warehouses and seaports. It significantly improves precision in challenging environments where UWB-only and LiDAR-Inertial methods fall short, as shown in the video (https://youtu.be/oY8jQKdM7lU). We will open-source our datasets and calibration codes for community use.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted to IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) @ 2025 IEEE.

Radar is emerging as a valuable sensing tool, especially in vision-obstructed environments, as it is less affected by particles than lidars or cameras. Modern 4D imaging radars provide three-dimensional geometric information and relative velocity measurements, but they bring challenges, such as a small field of view and sparse, noisy point clouds. Detecting loop closures in SLAM is critical for reducing trajectory drift and maintaining map accuracy. However, the directional nature of 4D radar data makes identifying loop closures, especially from reverse viewpoints, difficult due to limited scan overlap. This article explores using 4D radar for loop closure in SLAM, focusing on similar and opposing viewpoints. We generate submaps for a denser environment representation and use introspective measures to reject false detections in feature-degenerate environments. Our experiments show accurate loop closure detection in geometrically diverse settings for both similar and opposing viewpoints, improving trajectory estimation with up to 82 % improvement in ATE and rejecting false positives in self-similar environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication in the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation(ICRA), 2025</p></details> |

However, loop closure detection in large-scale missions presents significant computational challenges due to the need to identify, verify, and process numerous candidate pairs for pose graph optimization. Keyframe sampling bridges the front-end and back-end by selecting frames for storing and processing during global optimization. This article proposes an online keyframe sampling approach that constructs the pose graph using the most impactful keyframes for loop closure. We introduce the Minimal Subset Approach (MSA), which optimizes two key objectives: redundancy minimization and information preservation, implemented within a sliding window framework. By operating in the feature space rather than 3-D space, MSA efficiently reduces redundant keyframes while retaining essential information. In sum, evaluations on diverse public datasets show that the proposed approach outperforms naive methods in reducing false positive rates in place recognition, while delivering superior ATE and RPE in metric localization, without the need for manual parameter tuning. Additionally, MSA demonstrates efficiency and scalability by reducing memory usage and computational overhead during loop closure detection and pose graph optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 Figures, 2 Tables.

By normalizing point density, we project LiDAR point clouds into BEV images, thereby enabling efficient feature extraction and matching. A lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) based feature extractor is employed to extract distinctive local and global descriptors from the BEV images. Local descriptors are used to match BEV images with FAST keypoints for reprojection error construction, while global descriptors facilitate loop closure detection. Reprojection error minimization is then integrated with point-to-plane registration within an iterated Extended Kalman Filter (iEKF). In the back-end, global descriptors are used to create a KD-tree-indexed keyframe database for accurate loop closure detection. When a loop closure is detected, Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) computes a coarse transform from BEV image matching, which serves as the initial estimate for Iterative Closest Point (ICP). The refined transform is subsequently incorporated into a factor graph along with odometry factors, improving the global consistency of localization. Extensive experiments conducted in various scenarios with different LiDAR types demonstrate that BEV-LIO(LC) outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving competitive localization accuracy.

However, thermal imaging faces challenges like low contrast, high noise, and limited large-scale annotated datasets, restricting the use of deep learning in outdoor scenarios. We present DarkSLAM, a noval deep learning-based monocular thermal SLAM system designed for large-scale localization and reconstruction in complex lighting conditions.Our approach incorporates the Efficient Channel Attention (ECA) mechanism in visual odometry and the Selective Kernel Attention (SKA) mechanism in depth estimation to enhance pose accuracy and mitigate thermal depth degradation. Additionally, the system includes thermal depth-based loop closure detection and pose optimization, ensuring robust performance in low-texture thermal scenes. Extensive outdoor experiments demonstrate that DarkSLAM significantly outperforms existing methods like SC-Sfm-Learner and Shin et al., delivering precise localization and 3D dense mapping even in challenging nighttime environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Why Sample Space Matters: Keyframe Sampling Optimization for LiDAR-based Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02643v2)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in robotics are driving real-world autonomy for long-term and large-scale missions, where loop closures via place recognition are vital for mitigating pose estimation drift. However, achieving real-time performance remains challenging for resource-constrained mobile robots and multi-robot systems due to the computational burden of high-density sampling, which increases the complexity of comparing and verifying query samples against a growing map database. Conventional methods often retain redundant information or miss critical data by relying on fixed sampling intervals or operating in 3-D space instead of the descriptor feature space. To address these challenges, we introduce the concept of sample space and propose a novel keyframe sampling approach for LiDAR-based place recognition. Our method minimizes redundancy while preserving essential information in the hyper-dimensional descriptor space, supporting both learning-based and handcrafted descriptors. The proposed approach incorporates a sliding window optimization strategy to ensure efficient keyframe selection and real-time performance, enabling seamless integration into robotic pipelines. In sum, our approach demonstrates robust performance across diverse datasets, with the ability to adapt seamlessly from indoor to outdoor scenarios without parameter tuning, reducing loop closure detection times and memory requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 17 figures, 6 tables.

Our place recognition algorithm has two key modules, namely, a semantic graph encoder module and a graph comparison module. The semantic graph encoder employs graph attention networks to efficiently encode spatial, semantic and geometric information from the semantic graph of the input point cloud. We then use self-attention mechanism in both node-embedding and graph-embedding steps to create distinctive graph vectors. The graph vectors of the current scan and a keyframe scan are then compared in the graph comparison module to identify a possible loop closure. Specifically, employing the difference of the two graph vectors showed a significant improvement in performance, as shown in ablation studies. Lastly, we implemented a semantic registration algorithm that takes in loop closure candidate scans and estimates the relative 6 DoF pose constraint for the LiDAR SLAM system. Extensive evaluation on public datasets shows that our model is more accurate and robust, achieving 13% improvement in maximum F1 score on the SemanticKITTI dataset, when compared to the baseline semantic graph algorithm. For the benefit of the community, we open-source the complete implementation of our proposed algorithm and custom implementation of semantic registration at https://github.com/crepuscularlight/SemanticLoopClosure</p></details> |  |

The framework comprises four main components: VIO Front End, 2D Gaussian Map, NVS Loop Closure, and Dynamic Eraser. In the VIO Front End, RGB frames are processed through dense bundle adjustment and uncertainty estimation to extract scene geometry and poses. Based on this output, the mapping module incrementally constructs and maintains a 2D Gaussian map. Key components of the 2D Gaussian Map include a Sample-based Rasterizer, Score Manager, and Pose Refinement, which collectively improve mapping speed and localization accuracy. This enables the SLAM system to handle large-scale urban environments with up to 50 million Gaussian ellipsoids. To ensure global consistency in large-scale scenes, we design a Loop Closure module, which innovatively leverages the Novel View Synthesis (NVS) capabilities of Gaussian Splatting for loop closure detection and correction of the Gaussian map. Additionally, we propose a Dynamic Eraser to address the inevitable presence of dynamic objects in real-world outdoor scenes. Extensive evaluations in indoor and outdoor environments demonstrate that our approach achieves localization performance on par with Visual-Inertial Odometry while surpassing recent GS/NeRF SLAM methods. It also significantly outperforms all existing methods in terms of mapping and rendering quality. Furthermore, we developed a mobile app and verified that our framework can generate high-quality Gaussian maps in real time using only a smartphone camera and a low-frequency IMU sensor. To the best of our knowledge, VINGS-Mono is the first monocular Gaussian SLAM method capable of operating in outdoor environments and supporting kilometer-scale large scenes.</p></details> |  |

They often use SLAM approaches to build such maps. Loop closures via place recognition help maintain accurate pose estimates by mitigating global drift. This paper presents a robust loop closure detection pipeline for outdoor SLAM with LiDAR-equipped robots. The method handles various LiDAR sensors with different scanning patterns, field of views and resolutions. It generates local maps from LiDAR scans and aligns them using a ground alignment module to handle both planar and non-planar motion of the LiDAR, ensuring applicability across platforms. The method uses density-preserving bird's eye view projections of these local maps and extracts ORB feature descriptors from them for place recognition. It stores the feature descriptors in a binary search tree for efficient retrieval, and self-similarity pruning addresses perceptual aliasing in repetitive environments. Extensive experiments on public and self-recorded datasets demonstrate accurate loop closure detection, long-term localization, and cross-platform multi-map alignment, agnostic to the LiDAR scanning patterns, fields of view, and motion profiles.</p></details> |  |

The framework integrates a data-driven front-end for instance segmentation from either RGBD cameras or LiDARs and a custom back-end for optimizing robot trajectories and object landmarks in the map. To allow multiple robots to merge their information, we design semantics-driven place recognition algorithms that leverage the informativeness and viewpoint invariance of the object-level metric-semantic map for inter-robot loop closure detection. A communication module is designed to track each robot's observations and those of other robots whenever communication links are available. Our framework enables real-time decentralized operations onboard robots, allowing them to leverage communication opportunistically. We integrate the proposed framework with the autonomous navigation and exploration systems of three types of aerial and ground robots, conducting extensive experiments in a variety of indoor and outdoor environments. These experiments demonstrate its accuracy in inter-robot localization and object mapping, along with its moderate demands on computation, storage, and communication resources.

The first step determines whether loop closing should be performed, while the second estimates the 6-DoF pose to correct odometry drift. Current methods mostly focus on developing robust descriptors for loop closure detection, often neglecting loop pose estimation. A few methods that do include pose estimation either suffer from low accuracy or incur high computational costs. To tackle this problem, we introduce SGLC, a real-time semantic graph-guided full loop closing method, with robust loop closure detection and 6-DoF pose estimation capabilities. SGLC takes into account the distinct characteristics of foreground and background points. For foreground instances, it builds a semantic graph that not only abstracts point cloud representation for fast descriptor generation and matching but also guides the subsequent loop verification and initial pose estimation. Background points, meanwhile, are exploited to provide more geometric features for scan-wise descriptor construction and stable planar information for further pose refinement. Loop pose estimation employs a \mbox{coarse-fine-refine} registration scheme that considers the alignment of both instance points and background points, offering high efficiency and accuracy. Extensive experiments on multiple publicly available datasets demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we integrate SGLC into a SLAM system, eliminating accumulated errors and improving overall SLAM performance. The implementation of SGLC will be released at https://github.com/nubot-nudt/SGLC.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

High accuracy and robustness are essential for the long-term and stable localization capabilities of SLAM systems. Addressing the challenges of enhancing robustness and accuracy in visual-inertial SLAM, this paper propose SuperVINS, a real-time visual-inertial SLAM framework designed for challenging imaging conditions. In contrast to geometric modeling, deep learning features are capable of fully leveraging the implicit information present in images, which is often not captured by geometric features. Therefore, SuperVINS, developed as an enhancement of VINS-Fusion, integrates the deep learning neural network model SuperPoint for feature point extraction and loop closure detection. At the same time, a deep learning neural network LightGlue model for associating feature points is integrated in front-end feature matching. A feature matching enhancement strategy based on the RANSAC algorithm is proposed. The system is allowed to set different masks and RANSAC thresholds for various environments, thereby balancing computational cost and localization accuracy. Additionally, it allows for flexible training of specific SuperPoint bag of words tailored for loop closure detection in particular environments. The system enables real-time localization and mapping. Experimental validation on the well-known EuRoC dataset demonstrates that SuperVINS is comparable to other visual-inertial SLAM system in accuracy and robustness across the most challenging sequences. This paper analyzes the advantages of SuperVINS in terms of accuracy, real-time performance, and robustness. To facilitate knowledge exchange within the field, we have made the code for this paper publicly available.</p></details> |  |

The system consists of five modules: initialization, odometry, local mapping, loop closure, and global mapping, all employing the same map representation, an adaptive voxel map. The initialization provides an accurate initial state estimation and a consistent local map for subsequent modules, enabling the system to start with a highly dynamic initial state. The odometry, exploiting the short-term data association, rapidly estimates current states and detects potential system divergence. The local mapping, exploiting the mid-term data association, employs a local LiDAR-inertial bundle adjustment (BA) to refine the states (and the local map) within a sliding window of recent LiDAR scans. The loop closure detects previously visited places in the current and all previous sessions. The global mapping refines the global map with an efficient hierarchical global BA. The loop closure and global mapping both exploit long-term and multi-map data associations. We conducted a comprehensive benchmark comparison with other state-of-the-art methods across 30 sequences from three representative scenes, including narrow indoor environments using hand-held equipment, large-scale wilderness environments with aerial robots, and urban environments on vehicle platforms. Other experiments demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of the initialization, the capacity to work in multiple sessions, and relocalization in degenerated environments.</p></details> |  |

Current SLAM systems can achieve centimeter-level accuracy within a short period. However, there are still several challenges when dealing with largescale mapping tasks including significant storage requirements and difficulty of reusing the constructed maps. To address this, we first design an elastic and lightweight map representation called CELLmap, composed of several CELLs, each representing the local map at the corresponding location. Then, we design a general backend including CELL-based bidirectional registration module and loop closure detection module to improve global map consistency. Our experiments have demonstrated that CELLmap can represent the precise geometric structure of large-scale maps of KITTI dataset using only about 60 MB. Additionally, our general backend achieves up to a 26.88% improvement over various LiDAR odometry methods.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |

In this work, a metric of semantic uncertainty for open-set object detections produced by visual foundation models is calculated and then incorporated into an object-level uncertainty tracking framework. Object-level uncertainties and geometric relationships between objects are used to enable robust object-level loop closure detection for unknown object classes. The above loop closure detection problem is formulated as a graph-matching problem. While graph matching, in general, is NP-Complete, a solver for an equivalent formulation of the proposed graph matching problem as a graph editing problem is tested on multiple challenging underwater scenes. Results for this solver as well as three other solvers demonstrate that the proposed methods are feasible for real-time use in marine environments for the robust, open-set, multi-object, semantic-uncertainty-aware loop closure detection. Further experimental results on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that the method generalizes to large-scale terrestrial scenes.</p></details> |  |

| **[BEVPlace++: Fast, Robust, and Lightweight LiDAR Global Localization for Unmanned Ground Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01841v2)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This article introduces BEVPlace++, a novel, fast, and robust LiDAR global localization method for unmanned ground vehicles. It uses lightweight convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on Bird's Eye View (BEV) image-like representations of LiDAR data to achieve accurate global localization through place recognition followed by 3-DoF pose estimation. Our detailed analyses reveal an interesting fact that CNNs are inherently effective at extracting distinctive features from LiDAR BEV images. Remarkably, keypoints of two BEV images with large translations can be effectively matched using CNN-extracted features. Building on this insight, we design a rotation equivariant module (REM) to obtain distinctive features while enhancing robustness to rotational changes. A Rotation Equivariant and Invariant Network (REIN) is then developed by cascading REM and a descriptor generator, NetVLAD, to sequentially generate rotation equivariant local features and rotation invariant global descriptors. The global descriptors are used first to achieve robust place recognition, and the local features are used for accurate pose estimation. Experimental results on multiple public datasets demonstrate that BEVPlace++, even when trained on a small dataset (3000 frames of KITTI) only with place labels, generalizes well to unseen environments, performs consistently across different days and years, and adapts to various types of LiDAR scanners. BEVPlace++ achieves state-of-the-art performance in subtasks of global localization including place recognition, loop closure detection, and global localization.

| **[Active Loop Closure for OSM-guided Robotic Mapping in Large-Scale Urban Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17078v1)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The autonomous mapping of large-scale urban scenes presents significant challenges for autonomous robots. To mitigate the challenges, global planning, such as utilizing prior GPS trajectories from OpenStreetMap (OSM), is often used to guide the autonomous navigation of robots for mapping. However, due to factors like complex terrain, unexpected body movement, and sensor noise, the uncertainty of the robot's pose estimates inevitably increases over time, ultimately leading to the failure of robotic mapping. To address this issue, we propose a novel active loop closure procedure, enabling the robot to actively re-plan the previously planned GPS trajectory. The method can guide the robot to re-visit the previous places where the loop-closure detection can be performed to trigger the back-end optimization, effectively reducing errors and uncertainties in pose estimation. The proposed active loop closure mechanism is implemented and embedded into a real-time OSM-guided robot mapping framework. Empirical results on several large-scale outdoor scenarios demonstrate its effectiveness and promising performance.</p></details> |  |

This paper addresses these problems by tying the SLAM system with a global loop closure detection approach, which intrinsically handles these situations. However, online processing for global loop closure detection approaches is generally influenced by the size of the environment. The proposed graph-based SLAM system uses a memory management approach that only consider portions of the map to satisfy online processing requirements. The approach is tested and demonstrated using five indoor mapping sessions of a building using a robot equipped with a laser rangefinder and a Kinect.</p></details> | 6 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Appearance-Based Loop Closure Detection for Online Large-Scale and Long-Term Operation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15304v1)** | 2024-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In appearance-based localization and mapping, loop closure detection is the process used to determinate if the current observation comes from a previously visited location or a new one. As the size of the internal map increases, so does the time required to compare new observations with all stored locations, eventually limiting online processing. This paper presents an online loop closure detection approach for large-scale and long-term operation. The approach is based on a memory management method, which limits the number of locations used for loop closure detection so that the computation time remains under real-time constraints. The idea consists of keeping the most recent and frequently observed locations in a Working Memory (WM) used for loop closure detection, and transferring the others into a Long-Term Memory (LTM). When a match is found between the current location and one stored in WM, associated locations stored in LTM can be updated and remembered for additional loop closure detections. Results demonstrate the approach's adaptability and scalability using ten standard data sets from other appearance-based loop closure approaches, one custom data set using real images taken over a 2 km loop of our university campus, and one custom data set (7 hours) using virtual images from the racing video game ``Need for Speed: Most Wanted''.</p></details> | 12 pages, 11 figures |

Loop closures correct drifts in trajectory estimation to build a globally consistent map. However, a false loop closure can be fatal, so verification is required as an additional step to ensure robustness by rejecting the false positive loops. Geometric verification has been a well-acknowledged solution that leverages spatial clues provided by local feature matching to find true positives. Existing feature matching methods focus on homography and pose estimation in long-term visual localization, lacking references for geometric verification. To fill the gap, this paper proposes a unified benchmark targeting geometric verification of loop closure detection under long-term conditional variations. Furthermore, we evaluate six representative local feature matching methods (handcrafted and learning-based) under the benchmark, with in-depth analysis for limitations and future directions.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 11 figures, Accepted by IROS(2024)</p></details> |

Although deep learning-based local features excel at capturing high-level information and perform well on matching benchmarks, they struggle with generalization in continuous motion scenes, adversely affecting loop detection accuracy. Our system employs a Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) strategy to optimize the training of keypoint extraction networks, enhancing their adaptability to diverse environments. Additionally, we introduce a coarse-to-fine feature tracking mechanism for learned keypoints. It begins with a direct method to approximate the relative pose between consecutive frames, followed by a feature matching method for refined pose estimation. To mitigate cumulative positioning errors, DK-SLAM incorporates a novel online learning module that utilizes binary features for loop closure detection. This module dynamically identifies loop nodes within a sequence, ensuring accurate and efficient localization. Experimental evaluations on publicly available datasets demonstrate that DK-SLAM outperforms leading traditional and learning based SLAM systems, such as ORB-SLAM3 and LIFT-SLAM. These results underscore the efficacy and robustness of our DK-SLAM in varied and challenging real-world environments.</p></details> | In submission |
| **[CCTNet: A Circular Convolutional Transformer Network for LiDAR-based Place Recognition Handling Movable Objects Occlusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10793v2)** | 2024-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Place recognition is a fundamental task for robotic application, allowing robots to perform loop closure detection within simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), and achieve relocalization on prior maps. Current range image-based networks use single-column convolution to maintain feature invariance to shifts in image columns caused by LiDAR viewpoint change.However, this raises the issues such as "restricted receptive fields" and "excessive focus on local regions", degrading the performance of networks. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a lightweight circular convolutional Transformer network denoted as CCTNet, which boosts performance by capturing structural information in point clouds and facilitating crossdimensional interaction of spatial and channel information. Initially, a Circular Convolution Module (CCM) is introduced, expanding the network's perceptual field while maintaining feature consistency across varying LiDAR perspectives. Then, a Range Transformer Module (RTM) is proposed, which enhances place recognition accuracy in scenarios with movable objects by employing a combination of channel and spatial attention mechanisms. Furthermore, we propose an Overlap-based loss function, transforming the place recognition task from a binary loop closure classification into a regression problem linked to the overlap between LiDAR frames. Through extensive experiments on the KITTI and Ford Campus datasets, CCTNet surpasses comparable methods, achieving Recall@1 of 0.924 and 0.965, and Recall@1% of 0.990 and 0.993 on the test set, showcasing a superior performance. Results on the selfcollected dataset further demonstrate the proposed method's potential for practical implementation in complex scenarios to handle movable objects, showing improved generalization in various datasets.</p></details> |  |

It is also crucial in tasks such as loop closure detection and global localization within SLAM. Previous methods utilize mundane point cloud representations as input and deep learning-based LiDAR-based Place Recognition (LPR) approaches employing different point cloud image inputs with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or transformer architectures. However, the recently proposed Mamba deep learning model, combined with state space models (SSMs), holds great potential for long sequence modeling. Therefore, we developed OverlapMamba, a novel network for place recognition, which represents input range views (RVs) as sequences. In a novel way, we employ a stochastic reconstruction approach to build shift state space models, compressing the visual representation. Evaluated on three different public datasets, our method effectively detects loop closures, showing robustness even when traversing previously visited locations from different directions. Relying on raw range view inputs, it outperforms typical LiDAR and multi-view combination methods in time complexity and speed, indicating strong place recognition capabilities and real-time efficiency.</p></details> |  |

However, the utilization of 2D LiDAR in Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) frequently encounters challenges related to motion degeneracy, particularly in geometrically similar environments. To address this problem, this paper proposes a robust, accurate, and multi-sensor-fused 2D LiDAR SLAM system specifically designed for indoor mobile robots. To commence, the original LiDAR data undergoes meticulous processing through point and line extraction. Leveraging the distinctive characteristics of indoor environments, line-line constraints are established to complement other sensor data effectively, thereby augmenting the overall robustness and precision of the system. Concurrently, a tightly-coupled front-end is created, integrating data from the 2D LiDAR, IMU, and wheel odometry, thus enabling real-time state estimation. Building upon this solid foundation, a novel global feature point matching-based loop closure detection algorithm is proposed. This algorithm proves highly effective in mitigating front-end accumulated errors and ultimately constructs a globally consistent map. The experimental results indicate that our system fully meets real-time requirements. When compared to Cartographer, our system not only exhibits lower trajectory errors but also demonstrates stronger robustness, particularly in degeneracy problem.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by Measurement Science and Technology: https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6501/ad3ea3/meta</p></details> |

This article investigates the use of 4D imaging radars for SLAM and analyzes the challenges in robust loop closure. Previous work indicates that 4D radars, together with inertial measurements, offer ample information for accurate odometry estimation. However, the low field of view, limited resolution, and sparse and noisy measurements render loop closure a significantly more challenging problem. Our work builds on the previous work - TBV SLAM - which was proposed for robust loop closure with 360$^\circ$ spinning radars. This article highlights and addresses challenges inherited from a directional 4D radar, such as sparsity, noise, and reduced field of view, and discusses why the common definition of a loop closure is unsuitable. By combining multiple quality measures for accurate loop closure detection adapted to 4D radar data, significant results in trajectory estimation are achieved; the absolute trajectory error is as low as 0.46 m over a distance of 1.8 km, with consistent operation over multiple environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the workshop "Radar in Robotics: Resilience from Signal to Navigation" at ICRA 2024</p></details> |

Existing research on lidar-based loop closure heavily relies on dense point cloud and 360 FOV lidars. This paper proposes an out-of-the-box NDT (Normal Distribution Transform) based global descriptor, NDT-Map-Code, designed for both on-road driving and underground valet parking scenarios. NDT-Map-Code can be directly extracted from the NDT map without the need for a dense point cloud, resulting in excellent scalability and low maintenance cost. The NDT representation is leveraged to identify representative patterns, which are further encoded according to their spatial location (bearing, range, and height). Experimental results on the NIO underground parking lot dataset and the KITTI dataset demonstrate that our method achieves significantly better performance compared to the state-of-the-art.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

It then grew to implement Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) on various robots and mobile platforms. As each application brings its own set of contraints on sensors, processing capabilities and locomotion, it raises the question of which SLAM approach is the most appropriate to use in terms of cost, accuracy, computation power and ease of integration. Since most of SLAM approaches are either visual or lidar-based, comparison is difficult. Therefore, we decided to extend RTAB-Map to support both visual and lidar SLAM, providing in one package a tool allowing users to implement and compare a variety of 3D and 2D solutions for a wide range of applications with different robots and sensors. This paper presents this extended version of RTAB-Map and its use in comparing, both quantitatively and qualitatively, a large selection of popular real-world datasets (e.g., KITTI, EuRoC, TUM RGB-D, MIT Stata Center on PR2 robot), outlining strengths and limitations of visual and lidar SLAM configurations from a practical perspective for autonomous navigation applications.</p></details> | 40 pages, 19 figures |

Single-chip millimeter wave radar (single-chip radar in short) emerges as a low-cost sensor option for place recognition, with the advantage of insensitivity to degraded visual environments. However, it encounters two challenges. Firstly, sparse point cloud from single-chip radar leads to poor performance when using current place recognition methods, which assume much denser data. Secondly, its performance significantly declines in scenarios involving rotational and lateral variations, due to limited overlap in its field of view (FOV). We propose mmPlace, a robust place recognition system to address these challenges. Specifically, mmPlace transforms intermediate frequency (IF) signal into range azimuth heatmap and employs a spatial encoder to extract features. Additionally, to improve the performance in scenarios involving rotational and lateral variations, mmPlace employs a rotating platform and concatenates heatmaps in a rotation cycle, effectively expanding the system's FOV. We evaluate mmPlace's performance on the milliSonic dataset, which is collected on the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) campus, the city roads surrounding the campus, and an underground parking garage. The results demonstrate that mmPlace outperforms point cloud-based methods and achieves 87.37% recall@1 in scenarios involving rotational and lateral variations.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |

In particular, orchards are a difficult case study due to structural similarity across the entire field. In this work, we address the place recognition problem in orchards resorting to 3D LiDAR data, which is considered a key modality for robustness. Hence, we propose ORCHNet, a deep-learning-based approach that maps 3D-LiDAR scans to global descriptors. Specifically, this work proposes a new global feature aggregation approach, which fuses multiple aggregation methods into a robust global descriptor. ORCHNet is evaluated on real-world data collected in orchards, comprising data from the summer and autumn seasons. To assess the robustness, we compare ORCHNet with state-of-the-art aggregation approaches on data from the same season and across seasons. Moreover, we additionally evaluate the proposed approach as part of a localization framework, where ORCHNet is used as a loop closure detector. The empirical results indicate that, on the place recognition task, ORCHNet outperforms the remaining approaches, and is also more robust across seasons. As for the localization, the edge cases where the path goes through the trees are solved when integrating ORCHNet as a loop detector, showing the potential applicability of the proposed approach in this task.

Brains also appear to learn maps, but the mechanisms are not known and it is unclear how to infer these maps from neural activity data. We present BrainSLAM; a method for performing SLAM using only population activity (local field potential, LFP) data simultaneously recorded from three brain regions in rats: hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and parietal cortex. This system uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to decode velocity and familiarity information from wavelet scalograms of neural local field potential data recorded from rats as they navigate a 2D maze. The CNN's output drives a RatSLAM-inspired architecture, powering an attractor network which performs path integration plus a separate system which performs `loop closure' (detecting previously visited locations and correcting map aliasing errors). Together, these three components can construct faithful representations of the environment while simultaneously tracking the animal's location. This is the first demonstration of inference of a spatial map from brain recordings. Our findings expand SLAM to a new modality, enabling a new method of mapping environments and facilitating a better understanding of the role of cognitive maps in navigation and decision making.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 23rd International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems. 2024</p></details> |
| **[Attacking the Loop: Adversarial Attacks on Graph-based Loop Closure Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06991v1)** | 2023-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the advancement in robotics, it is becoming increasingly common for large factories and warehouses to incorporate visual SLAM (vSLAM) enabled automated robots that operate closely next to humans. This makes any adversarial attacks on vSLAM components potentially detrimental to humans working alongside them. Loop Closure Detection (LCD) is a crucial component in vSLAM that minimizes the accumulation of drift in mapping, since even a small drift can accumulate into a significant drift over time. A prior work by Kim et al., SymbioLCD2, unified visual features and semantic objects into a single graph structure for finding loop closure candidates. While this provided a performance improvement over visual feature-based LCD, it also created a single point of vulnerability for potential graph-based adversarial attacks. Unlike previously reported visual-patch based attacks, small graph perturbations are far more challenging to detect, making them a more significant threat. In this paper, we present Adversarial-LCD, a novel black-box evasion attack framework that employs an eigencentrality-based perturbation method and an SVM-RBF surrogate model with a Weisfeiler-Lehman feature extractor for attacking graph-based LCD. Our evaluation shows that the attack performance of Adversarial-LCD with the SVM-RBF surrogate model was superior to that of other machine learning surrogate algorithms, including SVM-linear, SVM-polynomial, and Bayesian classifier, demonstrating the effectiveness of our attack framework. Furthermore, we show that our eigencentrality-based perturbation method outperforms other algorithms, such as Random-walk and Shortest-path, highlighting the efficiency of Adversarial-LCD's perturbation selection method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at VISIGRAPP 2024, 8 pages</p></details> |

However, conventional loop closure methods based on low-level geometric or image features may cause high ambiguity by not distinguishing similar scenarios. Thus, incorrect loop closures can occur. Though semantic 2D image information is considered in some literature to detect loop closures, there is little work that compares 3D scenes as an integral part of a semantic SLAM system. This paper introduces an approach, called SmSLAM+LCD, integrated into a semantic SLAM system to combine high-level 3D semantic information and low-level feature information to conduct accurate loop closure detection and effective drift reduction. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated in testing results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Outram: One-shot Global Localization via Triangulated Scene Graph and Global Outlier Pruning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08914v1)** | 2023-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One-shot LiDAR localization refers to the ability to estimate the robot pose from one single point cloud, which yields significant advantages in initialization and relocalization processes. In the point cloud domain, the topic has been extensively studied as a global descriptor retrieval (i.e., loop closure detection) and pose refinement (i.e., point cloud registration) problem both in isolation or combined. However, few have explicitly considered the relationship between candidate retrieval and correspondence generation in pose estimation, leaving them brittle to substructure ambiguities. To this end, we propose a hierarchical one-shot localization algorithm called Outram that leverages substructures of 3D scene graphs for locally consistent correspondence searching and global substructure-wise outlier pruning. Such a hierarchical process couples the feature retrieval and the correspondence extraction to resolve the substructure ambiguities by conducting a local-to-global consistency refinement. We demonstrate the capability of Outram in a variety of scenarios in multiple large-scale outdoor datasets. Our implementation is open-sourced: https://github.com/Pamphlett/Outram.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

These applications encompass object recognition, image retrieval, and video analysis. LCD consists in identifying whether a robot has returned to a previously visited location, referred to as a loop, and then estimating the related roto-translation with respect to the analyzed location. Despite the numerous advantages of radar sensors, such as their ability to operate under diverse weather conditions and provide a wider range of view compared to other commonly used sensors (e.g., cameras or LiDARs), integrating radar data remains an arduous task due to intrinsic noise and distortion. To address this challenge, this research introduces RadarLCD, a novel supervised deep learning pipeline specifically designed for Loop Closure Detection using the FMCW Radar (Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave) sensor. RadarLCD, a learning-based LCD methodology explicitly designed for radar systems, makes a significant contribution by leveraging the pre-trained HERO (Hybrid Estimation Radar Odometry) model. Being originally developed for radar odometry, HERO's features are used to select key points crucial for LCD tasks. The methodology undergoes evaluation across a variety of FMCW Radar dataset scenes, and it is compared to state-of-the-art systems such as Scan Context for Place Recognition and ICP for Loop Closure. The results demonstrate that RadarLCD surpasses the alternatives in multiple aspects of Loop Closure Detection.</p></details> | 7 pages, 2 figures |

As a result of these disruptions, pervasive in indoor spaces, magnetic field data is often omitted from navigation algorithms in indoor environments. This paper leverages the spatially-varying disruptions to Earth's magnetic field to extract positional information for use in indoor navigation algorithms. The algorithm uses a rate gyro and an array of four magnetometers to estimate the robot's pose. Additionally, the magnetometer array is used to compute attitude-invariant measurements associated with the magnetic field and its gradient. These measurements are used to detect loop closure points. Experimental results indicate that the proposed approach can estimate the pose of a ground robot in an indoor environment within meter accuracy.</p></details> |  |

But the LiDAR-SLAM could be disturbed by current scene moving objects, resulting in drift errors and even loop-closure failure. Thus, the ability to detect and segment moving objects is essential for high-precision positioning and building a consistent map. In this paper, we address the problem of moving object segmentation from 3D LiDAR scans to improve the odometry and loop-closure accuracy of SLAM. We propose a novel 3D Sequential Moving-Object-Segmentation (3D-SeqMOS) method that can accurately segment the scene into moving and static objects, such as moving and static cars. Different from the existing projected-image method, we process the raw 3D point cloud and build a 3D convolution neural network for MOS task. In addition, to make full use of the spatio-temporal information of point cloud, we propose a point cloud residual mechanism using the spatial features of current scan and the temporal features of previous residual scans. Besides, we build a complete SLAM framework to verify the effectiveness and accuracy of 3D-SeqMOS. Experiments on SemanticKITTI dataset show that our proposed 3D-SeqMOS method can effectively detect moving objects and improve the accuracy of LiDAR odometry and loop-closure detection. The test results show our 3D-SeqMOS outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 12.4%. We extend the proposed method to the SemanticKITTI: Moving Object Segmentation competition and achieve the 2nd in the leaderboard, showing its effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present a novel radar-only place recognition that measures the similarity score by utilizing Radon-transformed sinogram images and cross-correlation in frequency domain. Doing so achieves rigid transform invariance during place recognition, while ignoring the effects of radar multipath and ring noises. In addition, we compute the radar similarity distance using mutable threshold to mitigate variability of the similarity score, and reduce the time complexity of processing a copious radar data with hierarchical retrieval. We demonstrate the matching performance for both intra-session loop-closure detection and global place recognition using a publicly available imaging radar datasets. We verify reliable performance compared to existing stable radar place recognition method.

Traditional large-scale map merging methods are fragile to incorrect data associations, and are primarily limited to working only offline. AutoMerge utilizes multi-perspective fusion and adaptive loop closure detection for accurate data associations, and it uses incremental merging to assemble large maps from individual trajectory segments given in random order and with no initial estimations. Furthermore, after assembling the segments, AutoMerge performs fine matching and pose-graph optimization to globally smooth the merged map. We demonstrate AutoMerge on both city-scale merging (120km) and campus-scale repeated merging (4.5km x 8). The experiments show that AutoMerge (i) surpasses the second- and third- best methods by 14% and 24% recall in segment retrieval, (ii) achieves comparable 3D mapping accuracy for 120 km large-scale map assembly, (iii) and it is robust to temporally-spaced revisits. To the best of our knowledge, AutoMerge is the first mapping approach that can merge hundreds of kilometers of individual segments without the aid of GPS.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 20 figures, IEEE Transactions on Robotics (T-RO) 2023</p></details> |

It enables the recognition of previously visited scenes to eliminate pose and map estimate drifts arising from long-term exploration. However, current appearance-based LCD methods face significant challenges, including high computational costs, viewpoint variance, and dynamic objects in scenes. This paper introduced an online appearance based LCD using local superpixel grids descriptor and dynamic node, i.e, LSGDDN-LCD, to find similarities between scenes via hand-crafted features extracted from LSGD. Unlike traditional Bag-of-Words (BoW) based LCD, which requires pre-training, we proposed an adaptive mechanism to group similar images called $\textbf{\textit{dynamic}}$ $\textbf{\textit{node}}$, which incrementally adjusted the database in an online manner, allowing for efficient and online retrieval of previously viewed images without need of the pre-training. Experimental results confirmed that the LSGDDN-LCD significantly improved LCD precision-recall and efficiency, and outperformed several state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches on multiple typical datasets, indicating its great potential as a generic LCD framework.</p></details> |  |

Recently, 3D LiDAR-based localization methods have used retrieval-based place recognition to find revisited places efficiently. However, when deployed in challenging real-world scenarios, the place recognition models become more complex, which comes at the cost of high computational demand. This work tackles this problem from an information-retrieval perspective, adopting a first-retrieve-then-re-ranking paradigm, where an initial loop candidate ranking, generated from a 3D place recognition model, is re-ordered by a proposed lightweight transformer-based re-ranking approach (TReR). The proposed approach relies on global descriptors only, being agnostic to the place recognition model. The experimental evaluation, conducted on the KITTI Odometry dataset, where we compared TReR with s.o.t.a. re-ranking approaches such as alphaQE and SGV, indicate the robustness and efficiency when compared to alphaQE while offering a good trade-off between robustness and efficiency when compared to SGV.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This preprint has been submitted to 26th IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems ITSC 2023</p></details> |
| **[Foundations of Spatial Perception for Robotics: Hierarchical Representations and Real-time Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07154v1)** | 2023-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D spatial perception is the problem of building and maintaining an actionable and persistent representation of the environment in real-time using sensor data and prior knowledge. Despite the fast-paced progress in robot perception, most existing methods either build purely geometric maps (as in traditional SLAM) or flat metric-semantic maps that do not scale to large environments or large dictionaries of semantic labels. The first part of this paper is concerned with representations: we show that scalable representations for spatial perception need to be hierarchical in nature. Hierarchical representations are efficient to store, and lead to layered graphs with small treewidth, which enable provably efficient inference. We then introduce an example of hierarchical representation for indoor environments, namely a 3D scene graph, and discuss its structure and properties. The second part of the paper focuses on algorithms to incrementally construct a 3D scene graph as the robot explores the environment. Our algorithms combine 3D geometry, topology (to cluster the places into rooms), and geometric deep learning (e.g., to classify the type of rooms the robot is moving across). The third part of the paper focuses on algorithms to maintain and correct 3D scene graphs during long-term operation. We propose hierarchical descriptors for loop closure detection and describe how to correct a scene graph in response to loop closures, by solving a 3D scene graph optimization problem. We conclude the paper by combining the proposed perception algorithms into Hydra, a real-time spatial perception system that builds a 3D scene graph from visual-inertial data in real-time. We showcase Hydra's performance in photo-realistic simulations and real data collected by a Clearpath Jackal robots and a Unitree A1 robot. We release an open-source implementation of Hydra at https://github.com/MIT-SPARK/Hydra.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 19 figures; submitted to International Journal of Robotics Research</p></details> |

This paper describes Hydra-Multi, the first multi-robot spatial perception system capable of constructing a multi-robot 3D scene graph online from sensor data collected by robots in a team. In particular, we develop a centralized system capable of constructing a joint 3D scene graph by taking incremental inputs from multiple robots, effectively finding the relative transforms between the robots' frames, and incorporating loop closure detections to correctly reconcile the scene graph nodes from different robots. We evaluate Hydra-Multi on simulated and real scenarios and show it is able to reconstruct accurate 3D scene graphs online. We also demonstrate Hydra-Multi's capability of supporting heterogeneous teams by fusing different map representations built by robots with different sensor suites.</p></details> | 8 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Loop Closure Detection Based on Object-level Spatial Layout and Semantic Consistency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05146v2)** | 2023-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) systems face challenges in detecting loop closure under the circumstance of large viewpoint changes. In this paper, we present an object-based loop closure detection method based on the spatial layout and semanic consistency of the 3D scene graph. Firstly, we propose an object-level data association approach based on the semantic information from semantic labels, intersection over union (IoU), object color, and object embedding. Subsequently, multi-view bundle adjustment with the associated objects is utilized to jointly optimize the poses of objects and cameras. We represent the refined objects as a 3D spatial graph with semantics and topology. Then, we propose a graph matching approach to select correspondence objects based on the structure layout and semantic property similarity of vertices' neighbors. Finally, we jointly optimize camera trajectories and object poses in an object-level pose graph optimization, which results in a globally consistent map. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed data association approach can construct more accurate 3D semantic maps, and our loop closure method is more robust than point-based and object-based methods in circumstances with large viewpoint changes.</p></details> |  |
| **[PADLoC: LiDAR-Based Deep Loop Closure Detection and Registration Using Panoptic Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09699v3)** | 2023-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A key component of graph-based SLAM systems is the ability to detect loop closures in a trajectory to reduce the drift accumulated over time from the odometry. Most LiDAR-based methods achieve this goal by using only the geometric information, disregarding the semantics of the scene. In this work, we introduce PADLoC for joint loop closure detection and registration in LiDAR-based SLAM frameworks. We propose a novel transformer-based head for point cloud matching and registration, and to leverage panoptic information during training time. In particular, we propose a novel loss function that reframes the matching problem as a classification task for the semantic labels and as a graph connectivity assignment for the instance labels. During inference, PADLoC does not require panoptic annotations, making it more versatile than other methods. Additionally, we show that using two shared matching and registration heads with their source and target inputs swapped increases the overall performance by enforcing forward-backward consistency. We perform extensive evaluations of PADLoC on multiple real-world datasets demonstrating that it achieves state-of-the-art results. The code of our work is publicly available at http://padloc.cs.uni-freiburg.de.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimized SC-F-LOAM: Optimized Fast LiDAR Odometry and Mapping Using Scan Context](http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.04932v2)** | 2023-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR odometry can achieve accurate vehicle pose estimation for short driving range or in small-scale environments, but for long driving range or in large-scale environments, the accuracy deteriorates as a result of cumulative estimation errors. This drawback necessitates the inclusion of loop closure detection in a SLAM framework to suppress the adverse effects of cumulative errors. To improve the accuracy of pose estimation, we propose a new LiDAR-based SLAM method which uses F-LOAM as LiDAR odometry, Scan Context for loop closure detection, and GTSAM for global optimization. In our approach, an adaptive distance threshold (instead of a fixed threshold) is employed for loop closure detection, which achieves more accurate loop closure detection results. Besides, a feature-based matching method is used in our approach to compute vehicle pose transformations between loop closure point cloud pairs, instead of using the raw point cloud obtained by the LiDAR sensor, which significantly reduces the computation time. The KITTI dataset is used for verifications of our method, and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms typical LiDAR odometry/SLAM methods in the literature. Our code is made publicly available for the benefit of the community.</p></details> |  |

Natural and unstructured environments present many additional challenges for the tasks of long-term localisation but these environments are not represented in currently available datasets. To address this we introduce Wild-Places, a challenging large-scale dataset for lidar place recognition in unstructured, natural environments. Wild-Places contains eight lidar sequences collected with a handheld sensor payload over the course of fourteen months, containing a total of 63K undistorted lidar submaps along with accurate 6DoF ground truth. Our dataset contains multiple revisits both within and between sequences, allowing for both intra-sequence (i.e. loop closure detection) and inter-sequence (i.e. re-localisation) place recognition. We also benchmark several state-of-the-art approaches to demonstrate the challenges that this dataset introduces, particularly the case of long-term place recognition due to natural environments changing over time.

| **[Region Prediction for Efficient Robot Localization on Large Maps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00295v1)** | 2023-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recognizing already explored places (a.k.a. place recognition) is a fundamental task in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) to enable robot relocalization and loop closure detection. In topological SLAM the recognition takes place by comparing a signature (or feature vector) associated to the current node with the signatures of the nodes in the known map. However, as the number of nodes increases, matching the current node signature against all the existing ones becomes inefficient and thwarts real-time navigation. In this paper we propose a novel approach to pre-select a subset of map nodes for place recognition. The map nodes are clustered during exploration and each cluster is associated with a region. The region labels become the prediction targets of a deep neural network and, during navigation, only the nodes associated with the regions predicted with high probability are considered for matching. While the proposed technique can be integrated in different SLAM approaches, in this work we describe an effective integration with RTAB-Map (a popular framework for real-time topological SLAM) which allowed us to design and run several experiments to demonstrate its effectiveness. All the code and material from the experiments will be available online at https://github.com/MI-BioLab/region-learner.</p></details> |  |

Integrating the Ultra-Wideband(UWB) technique has been shown to correct the long-term estimation drift and bypass the complexity of loop closure detection. However, few works on robotics adopt UWB as a stand-alone state estimation solution. The primary purpose of this work is to investigate planar pose estimation using only UWB range measurements and study the estimator's statistical efficiency. We prove the excellent property of a two-step scheme, which says that we can refine a consistent estimator to be asymptotically efficient by one step of Gauss-Newton iteration. Grounded on this result, we design the GN-ULS estimator and evaluate it through simulations and collected datasets. GN-ULS attains millimeter and sub-degree level accuracy on our static datasets and attains centimeter and degree level accuracy on our dynamic datasets, presenting the possibility of using only UWB for real-time state estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Update the content and improve consistency with the ICRA version</p></details> |

We interpret the Cartesian birds' eye view (BEV) image projected from 3D LiDAR points as layered distribution of structures. To recover elevation information from BEVs, we slice them at different heights, and connected pixels at each level will form contours. Each contour is parameterized by abstract information, e.g., pixel count, center position, covariance, and mean height. The similarity of two BEVs is calculated in sequential discrete and continuous steps. The first step considers the geometric consensus of graph-like constellations formed by contours in particular localities. The second step models the majority of contours as a 2.5D Gaussian mixture model, which is used to calculate correlation and optimize relative transform in continuous space. A retrieval key is designed to accelerate the search of a database indexed by layered KD-trees. We validate the efficacy of our method by comparing it with recent works on public datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 7 figures, accepted by ICRA 2023</p></details> |

Our proposed SLAM system is consist of visual-inertial odometry (VIO) and LiDAR inertial odometry (LIO) subsystems. We propose the LIO subsystem utilizing the measurement from the LiDAR and the inertial sensors to build the local odometry map, and propose the VIO subsystem which takes in the visual information to construct the 2D-3D associated map. Then, we propose an iterative Kalman Filter-based optimization function to optimize the local project-based 2D-to-3D photo-metric error between the projected image pixels and the local 3D points to make the robust 2D-3D alignment. Finally, we have also proposed the back-end pose graph global optimization and the elaborately designed loop closure detection network to improve the accuracy of the whole SLAM system.

Existing tactile surface reconstruction methods rely on external sensors or have strong prior assumptions, making the operation complex and limiting their application scenarios. This paper presents a framework for low-drift surface reconstruction through multiple tactile measurements, Tac2Structure. Compared with existing algorithms, the proposed method uses only a new vision-based tactile sensor without relying on external devices. Aiming at the difficulty that reconstruction accuracy is easily affected by the pressure at contact, we propose a correction algorithm to adapt it. The proposed method also reduces the accumulative errors that occur easily during global object surface reconstruction. Multi-frame tactile measurements can accurately reconstruct object surfaces by jointly using the point cloud registration algorithm, loop-closure detection algorithm based on deep learning, and pose graph optimization algorithm. Experiments verify that Tac2Structure can achieve millimeter-level accuracy in reconstructing the surface of objects, providing accurate tactile information for the robot to perceive the surrounding environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Robotics And Automation Letters</p></details> |

With the success of DL approaches in learning useful information from 3D LiDARs, place recognition has also benefited from this modality, which has led to higher re-localization and loop-closure detection performance, particularly, in environments with significant changing conditions. Despite the progress in this field, the extraction of proper and efficient descriptors from 3D LiDAR data that are invariant to changing conditions and orientation is still an unsolved challenge. To address this problem, this work proposes a novel 3D LiDAR-based deep learning network (named AttDLNet) that uses a range-based proxy representation for point clouds and an attention network with stacked attention layers to selectively focus on long-range context and inter-feature relationships. The proposed network is trained and validated on the KITTI dataset and an ablation study is presented to assess the novel attention network. Results show that adding attention to the network improves performance, leading to efficient loop closures, and outperforming an established 3D LiDAR-based place recognition approach. From the ablation study, results indicate that the middle encoder layers have the highest mean performance, while deeper layers are more robust to orientation change.

| **[GraffMatch: Global Matching of 3D Lines and Planes for Wide Baseline LiDAR Registration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12745v1)** | 2022-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Using geometric landmarks like lines and planes can increase navigation accuracy and decrease map storage requirements compared to commonly-used LiDAR point cloud maps. However, landmark-based registration for applications like loop closure detection is challenging because a reliable initial guess is not available. Global landmark matching has been investigated in the literature, but these methods typically use ad hoc representations of 3D line and plane landmarks that are not invariant to large viewpoint changes, resulting in incorrect matches and high registration error. To address this issue, we adopt the affine Grassmannian manifold to represent 3D lines and planes and prove that the distance between two landmarks is invariant to rotation and translation if a shift operation is performed before applying the Grassmannian metric. This invariance property enables the use of our graph-based data association framework for identifying landmark matches that can subsequently be used for registration in the least-squares sense. Evaluated on a challenging landmark matching and registration task using publicly-available LiDAR datasets, our approach yields a 1.7x and 3.5x improvement in successful registrations compared to methods that use viewpoint-dependent centroid and "closest point" representations, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted to RA-L; 8 pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2205.08556</p></details> |

In this work, we propose a faster, lighter and stronger approach that can generate models with fewer parameters and can spend less time in the inference stage. We designed RepVGG-lite as the backbone network in our architecture, it is more discriminative than other general networks in the Place Recognition task. RepVGG-lite has more speed advantages while achieving higher performance. We extract only one scale patch-level descriptors from global descriptors in the feature extraction stage. Then we design a trainable feature matcher to exploit both spatial relationships of the features and their visual appearance, which is based on the attention mechanism. Comprehensive experiments on challenging benchmark datasets demonstrate the proposed method outperforming recent other state-of-the-art learned approaches, and achieving even higher inference speed. Our system has 14 times less params than Patch-NetVLAD, 6.8 times lower theoretical FLOPs, and run faster 21 and 33 times in feature extraction and feature matching. Moreover, the performance of our approach is 0.5\% better than Patch-NetVLAD in Recall@1.

Our approach decreases the computational overhead of classical approaches by pruning the search space of potential loop closures, prior to evaluation by a typical multi-robot SLAM pipeline. Wi-Closure achieves this by identifying candidates that are spatially close to each other by using sensing over the wireless communication signal between robots, even when they are operating in non-line-of-sight or in remote areas of the environment from one another. We demonstrate the validity of our approach in simulation and hardware experiments. Our results show that using Wi-closure greatly reduces computation time, by 54% in simulation and by 77% in hardware compared, with a multi-robot SLAM baseline. Importantly, this is achieved without sacrificing accuracy. Using Wi-Closure reduces absolute trajectory estimation error by 99% in simulation and 89.2% in hardware experiments. This improvement is due in part to Wi-Closure's ability to avoid catastrophic optimization failure that typically occurs with classical approaches in challenging repetitive environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages without references</p></details> |

This is one of the most critical questions that any intelligent system should answer to decide whether it navigates to a previously visited area. This problem has long been acknowledged for its challenging nature in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), wherein the robot needs to correctly associate the incoming sensory data to the database allowing consistent map generation. The significant advances in computer vision achieved over the last 20 years, the increased computational power, and the growing demand for long-term exploration contributed to efficiently performing such a complex task with inexpensive perception sensors. In this article, visual loop closure detection, which formulates a solution based solely on appearance input data, is surveyed. We start by briefly introducing place recognition and SLAM concepts in robotics. Then, we describe a loop closure detection system's structure, covering an extensive collection of topics, including the feature extraction, the environment representation, the decision-making step, and the evaluation process. We conclude by discussing open and new research challenges, particularly concerning the robustness in dynamic environments, the computational complexity, and scalability in long-term operations. The article aims to serve as a tutorial and a position paper for newcomers to visual loop closure detection.</p></details> | 25 pages, 15 figures |
| **[A Framework for Collaborative Multi-Robot Mapping using Spectral Graph Wavelets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13856v2)** | 2022-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The exploration of large-scale unknown environments can benefit from the deployment of multiple robots for collaborative mapping. Each robot explores a section of the environment and communicates onboard pose estimates and maps to a central server to build an optimized global multi-robot map. Naturally, inconsistencies can arise between onboard and server estimates due to onboard odometry drift, failures, or degeneracies. The mapping server can correct and overcome such failure cases using computationally expensive operations such as inter-robot loop closure detection and multi-modal mapping. However, the individual robots do not benefit from the collaborative map if the mapping server provides no feedback. Although server updates from the multi-robot map can greatly alleviate the robotic mission strategically, most existing work lacks them, due to their associated computational and bandwidth-related costs. Motivated by this challenge, this paper proposes a novel collaborative mapping framework that enables global mapping consistency among robots and the mapping server. In particular, we propose graph spectral analysis, at different spatial scales, to detect structural differences between robot and server graphs, and to generate necessary constraints for the individual robot pose graphs. Our approach specifically finds the nodes that correspond to the drift's origin rather than the nodes where the error becomes too large. We thoroughly analyze and validate our proposed framework using several real-world multi-robot field deployments where we show improvements of the onboard system up to 90\% and can recover the onboard estimation from localization failures and even from the degeneracies within its estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2203.00308</p></details> |

In recent years, deep learning brings improvements to place recognition by learnable feature extraction. However, these methods degenerate when the robot re-visits previous places with large perspective difference. To address the challenge, we propose DeepRING to learn the roto-translation invariant representation from LiDAR scan, so that robot visits the same place with different perspective can have similar representations. There are two keys in DeepRING: the feature is extracted from sinogram, and the feature is aggregated by magnitude spectrum. The two steps keeps the final representation with both discrimination and roto-translation invariance. Moreover, we state the place recognition as a one-shot learning problem with each place being a class, leveraging relation learning to build representation similarity. Substantial experiments are carried out on public datasets, validating the effectiveness of each proposed component, and showing that DeepRING outperforms the comparative methods, especially in dataset level generalization.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |

Each sensor is processed by a bio-inspired Spiking Neural Network (SNN) with continual Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) learning, as observed in the brain. In contrast to most learning-based SLAM systems%, which a) require the acquisition of a representative dataset of the environment in which navigation must be performed and b) require an off-line training phase, our method does not require any offline training phase, but rather the SNN continuously learns features from the input data on the fly via STDP. At the same time, the SNN outputs are used as feature descriptors for loop closure detection and map correction. We conduct numerous experiments to benchmark our system against state-of-the-art RGB methods and we demonstrate the robustness of our DVS-Radar SLAM approach under strong lighting variations.</p></details> |  |

| **[Closing the Loop: Graph Networks to Unify Semantic Objects and Visual Features for Multi-object Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11894v1)** | 2022-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), Loop Closure Detection (LCD) is essential to minimize drift when recognizing previously visited places. Visual Bag-of-Words (vBoW) has been an LCD algorithm of choice for many state-of-the-art SLAM systems. It uses a set of visual features to provide robust place recognition but fails to perceive the semantics or spatial relationship between feature points. Previous work has mainly focused on addressing these issues by combining vBoW with semantic and spatial information from objects in the scene. However, they are unable to exploit spatial information of local visual features and lack a structure that unifies semantic objects and visual features, therefore limiting the symbiosis between the two components. This paper proposes SymbioLCD2, which creates a unified graph structure to integrate semantic objects and visual features symbiotically. Our novel graph-based LCD system utilizes the unified graph structure by applying a Weisfeiler-Lehman graph kernel with temporal constraints to robustly predict loop closure candidates. Evaluation of the proposed system shows that having a unified graph structure incorporating semantic objects and visual features improves LCD prediction accuracy, illustrating that the proposed graph structure provides a strong symbiosis between these two complementary components. It also outperforms other Machine Learning algorithms - such as SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Neural Network and GNN based Graph Matching Networks. Furthermore, it has shown good performance in detecting loop closure candidates earlier than state-of-the-art SLAM systems, demonstrating that extended semantic and spatial awareness from the unified graph structure significantly impacts LCD performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages.

| **[HGI-SLAM: Loop Closure With Human and Geometric Importance Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08608v1)** | 2022-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Human and Geometric Importance SLAM (HGI-SLAM), a novel approach to loop closure using salient and geometric features. Loop closure is a key element of SLAM, with many established methods for this problem. However, current methods are narrow, using either geometric or salient based features. We merge their successes into a model that outperforms both types of methods alone. Our method utilizes inexpensive monocular cameras and does not depend on depth sensors nor Lidar. HGI-SLAM utilizes geometric and salient features, processes them into descriptors, and optimizes them for a bag of words algorithm. By using a concurrent thread and combing our loop closure detection with ORB-SLAM2, our system is a complete SLAM framework. We present extensive evaluations of HGI loop detection and HGI-SLAM on the KITTI and EuRoC datasets. We also provide a qualitative analysis of our features. Our method runs in real time, and is robust to large viewpoint changes while staying accurate in organic environments. HGI-SLAM is an end-to-end SLAM system that only requires monocular vision and is comparable in performance to state-of-the-art SLAM methods.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Data-driven Loop Closure Detection in Bathymetric Point Clouds for Underwater SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08578v1)** | 2022-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) frameworks for autonomous navigation rely on robust data association to identify loop closures for back-end trajectory optimization. In the case of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) equipped with multibeam echosounders (MBES), data association is particularly challenging due to the scarcity of identifiable landmarks in the seabed, the large drift in dead-reckoning navigation estimates to which AUVs are prone and the low resolution characteristic of MBES data. Deep learning solutions to loop closure detection have shown excellent performance on data from more structured environments. However, their transfer to the seabed domain is not immediate and efforts to port them are hindered by the lack of bathymetric datasets. Thus, in this paper we propose a neural network architecture aimed to showcase the potential of adapting such techniques to correspondence matching in bathymetric data. We train our framework on real bathymetry from an AUV mission and evaluate its performance on the tasks of loop closure detection and coarse point cloud alignment. Finally, we show its potential against a more traditional method and release both its implementation and the dataset used.</p></details> |  |
| **[General Place Recognition Survey: Towards the Real-world Autonomy Age](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04497v1)** | 2022-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Place recognition is the fundamental module that can assist Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) in loop-closure detection and re-localization for long-term navigation. The place recognition community has made astonishing progress over the last $20$ years, and this has attracted widespread research interest and application in multiple fields such as computer vision and robotics. However, few methods have shown promising place recognition performance in complex real-world scenarios, where long-term and large-scale appearance changes usually result in failures. Additionally, there is a lack of an integrated framework amongst the state-of-the-art methods that can handle all of the challenges in place recognition, which include appearance changes, viewpoint differences, robustness to unknown areas, and efficiency in real-world applications. In this work, we survey the state-of-the-art methods that target long-term localization and discuss future directions and opportunities. We start by investigating the formulation of place recognition in long-term autonomy and the major challenges in real-world environments. We then review the recent works in place recognition for different sensor modalities and current strategies for dealing with various place recognition challenges. Finally, we review the existing datasets for long-term localization and introduce our datasets and evaluation API for different approaches. This paper can be a tutorial for researchers new to the place recognition community and those who care about long-term robotics autonomy. We also provide our opinion on the frequently asked question in robotics: Do robots need accurate localization for long-term autonomy? A summary of this work and our datasets and evaluation API is publicly available to the robotics community at: https://github.com/MetaSLAM/GPRS.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 10 figures.

| **[PLD-SLAM: A Real-Time Visual SLAM Using Points and Line Segments in Dynamic Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.10916v1)** | 2022-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we consider the problems in the practical application of visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). With the popularization and application of the technology in wide scope, the practicability of SLAM system has become a new hot topic after the accuracy and robustness, e.g., how to keep the stability of the system and achieve accurate pose estimation in the low-texture and dynamic environment, and how to improve the universality and real-time performance of the system in the real scenes, etc. This paper proposes a real-time stereo indirect visual SLAM system, PLD-SLAM, which combines point and line features, and avoid the impact of dynamic objects in highly dynamic environments. We also present a novel global gray similarity (GGS) algorithm to achieve reasonable keyframe selection and efficient loop closure detection (LCD). Benefiting from the GGS, PLD-SLAM can realize real-time accurate pose estimation in most real scenes without pre-training and loading a huge feature dictionary model. To verify the performance of the proposed system, we compare it with existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on the public datasets KITTI, EuRoC MAV, and the indoor stereo datasets provided by us, etc. The experiments show that the PLD-SLAM has better real-time performance while ensuring stability and accuracy in most scenarios. In addition, through the analysis of the experimental results of the GGS, we can find it has excellent performance in the keyframe selection and LCD.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semi-supervised Vector-Quantization in Visual SLAM using HGCN](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06738v1)** | 2022-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, two semi-supervised appearance based loop closure detection technique, HGCN-FABMAP and HGCN-BoW are introduced. Furthermore an extension to the current state of the art localization SLAM algorithm, ORB-SLAM, is presented. The proposed HGCN-FABMAP method is implemented in an off-line manner incorporating Bayesian probabilistic schema for loop detection decision making. Specifically, we let a Hyperbolic Graph Convolutional Neural Network (HGCN) to operate over the SURF features graph space, and perform vector quantization part of the SLAM procedure. This part previously was performed in an unsupervised manner using algorithms like HKmeans, kmeans++,..etc. The main Advantage of using HGCN, is that it scales linearly in number of graph edges. Experimental results shows that HGCN-FABMAP algorithm needs far more cluster centroids than HGCN-ORB, otherwise it fails to detect loop closures. Therefore we consider HGCN-ORB to be more efficient in terms of memory consumption, also we conclude the superiority of HGCN-BoW and HGCN-FABMAP with respect to other algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-supervised Vector-Quantization in Visual SLAM using Deep Convolutional Autoencoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06732v1)** | 2022-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce AE-FABMAP, a new self-supervised bag of words-based SLAM method. We also present AE-ORB-SLAM, a modified version of the current state of the art BoW-based path planning algorithm. That is, we have used a deep convolutional autoencoder to find loop closures. In the context of bag of words visual SLAM, vector quantization (VQ) is considered as the most time-consuming part of the SLAM procedure, which is usually performed in the offline phase of the SLAM algorithm using unsupervised algorithms such as Kmeans++. We have addressed the loop closure detection part of the BoW-based SLAM methods in a self-supervised manner, by integrating an autoencoder for doing vector quantization. This approach can increase the accuracy of large-scale SLAM, where plenty of unlabeled data is available. The main advantage of using a self-supervised is that it can help reducing the amount of labeling. Furthermore, experiments show that autoencoders are far more efficient than semi-supervised methods like graph convolutional neural networks, in terms of speed and memory consumption. We integrated this method into the state of the art long range appearance based visual bag of word SLAM, FABMAP2, also in ORB-SLAM. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of this approach in indoor and outdoor datasets over regular FABMAP2 in all cases, and it achieves higher accuracy in loop closure detection and trajectory generation.</p></details> |  |

This crucial requirement is faced with many challenges in complex and perceptually-degraded subterranean environments, as the onboard perception system is required to operate in off-nominal conditions (poor visibility due to darkness and dust, rugged and muddy terrain, and the presence of self-similar and ambiguous scenes). In a disaster response scenario and in the absence of prior information about the environment, robots must rely on noisy sensor data and perform Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) to build a 3D map of the environment and localize themselves and potential survivors. To that end, this paper reports on a multi-robot SLAM system developed by team CoSTAR in the context of the DARPA Subterranean Challenge. We extend our previous work, LAMP, by incorporating a single-robot front-end interface that is adaptable to different odometry sources and lidar configurations, a scalable multi-robot front-end to support inter- and intra-robot loop closure detection for large scale environments and multi-robot teams, and a robust back-end equipped with an outlier-resilient pose graph optimization based on Graduated Non-Convexity. We provide a detailed ablation study on the multi-robot front-end and back-end, and assess the overall system performance in challenging real-world datasets collected across mines, power plants, and caves in the United States. We also release our multi-robot back-end datasets (and the corresponding ground truth), which can serve as challenging benchmarks for large-scale underground SLAM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hydra: A Real-time Spatial Perception System for 3D Scene Graph Construction and Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.13360v2)** | 2022-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D scene graphs have recently emerged as a powerful high-level representation of 3D environments. A 3D scene graph describes the environment as a layered graph where nodes represent spatial concepts at multiple levels of abstraction and edges represent relations between concepts. While 3D scene graphs can serve as an advanced "mental model" for robots, how to build such a rich representation in real-time is still uncharted territory. This paper describes a real-time Spatial Perception System, a suite of algorithms to build a 3D scene graph from sensor data in real-time. Our first contribution is to develop real-time algorithms to incrementally construct the layers of a scene graph as the robot explores the environment; these algorithms build a local Euclidean Signed Distance Function (ESDF) around the current robot location, extract a topological map of places from the ESDF, and then segment the places into rooms using an approach inspired by community-detection techniques. Our second contribution is to investigate loop closure detection and optimization in 3D scene graphs. We show that 3D scene graphs allow defining hierarchical descriptors for loop closure detection; our descriptors capture statistics across layers in the scene graph, ranging from low-level visual appearance to summary statistics about objects and places. We then propose the first algorithm to optimize a 3D scene graph in response to loop closures; our approach relies on embedded deformation graphs to simultaneously correct all layers of the scene graph. We implement the proposed Spatial Perception System into a architecture named Hydra, that combines fast early and mid-level perception processes with slower high-level perception. We evaluate Hydra on simulated and real data and show it is able to reconstruct 3D scene graphs with an accuracy comparable with batch offline methods despite running online.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 10 figures, published in Robotics Science and Systems (RSS) 2022 proceedings</p></details> |
| **[Efficient WiFi LiDAR SLAM for Autonomous Robots in Large Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08733v1)** | 2022-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous robots operating in indoor and GPS denied environments can use LiDAR for SLAM instead. However, LiDARs do not perform well in geometrically-degraded environments, due to the challenge of loop closure detection and computational load to perform scan matching. Existing WiFi infrastructure can be exploited for localization and mapping with low hardware and computational cost. Yet, accurate pose estimation using WiFi is challenging as different signal values can be measured at the same location due to the unpredictability of signal propagation. Therefore, we introduce the use of WiFi fingerprint sequence for pose estimation (i.e. loop closure) in SLAM. This approach exploits the spatial coherence of location fingerprints obtained while a mobile robot is moving. This has better capability of correcting odometry drift. The method also incorporates LiDAR scans and thus, improving computational efficiency for large and geometrically-degraded environments while maintaining the accuracy of LiDAR SLAM. We conducted experiments in an indoor environment to illustrate the effectiveness of the method. The results are evaluated based on Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and it has achieved an accuracy of 0.88m for the test environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by the 2022 IEEE 18th International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE)</p></details> |

In this paper, aiming at strengthening the relevancy of local neighboring points and the contextual dependency among global points simultaneously, we investigate the exploitation of transformer-based network for feature extraction, and propose a Hierarchical Transformer for Place Recognition (HiTPR). The HiTPR consists of four major parts: point cell generation, short-range transformer (SRT), long-range transformer (LRT) and global descriptor aggregation. Specifically, the point cloud is initially divided into a sequence of small cells by downsampling and nearest neighbors searching. In the SRT, we extract the local feature for each point cell. While in the LRT, we build the global dependency among all of the point cells in the whole point cloud. Experiments on several standard benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of the HiTPR in terms of average recall rate, achieving 93.71% at top 1% and 86.63% at top 1 on the Oxford RobotCar dataset for example.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted paper in ICRA 2022</p></details> |
| **[Bi-directional Loop Closure for Visual SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.01524v1)** | 2022-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A key functional block of visual navigation system for intelligent autonomous vehicles is Loop Closure detection and subsequent relocalisation. State-of-the-Art methods still approach the problem as uni-directional along the direction of the previous motion. As a result, most of the methods fail in the absence of a significantly similar overlap of perspectives. In this study, we propose an approach for bi-directional loop closure. This will, for the first time, provide us with the capability to relocalize to a location even when traveling in the opposite direction, thus significantly reducing long-term odometry drift in the absence of a direct loop. We present a technique to select training data from large datasets in order to make them usable for the bi-directional problem. The data is used to train and validate two different CNN architectures for loop closure detection and subsequent regression of 6-DOF camera pose between the views in an end-to-end manner. The outcome packs a considerable impact and aids significantly to real-world scenarios that do not offer direct loop closure opportunities. We provide a rigorous empirical comparison against other established approaches and evaluate our method on both outdoor and indoor data from the FinnForest dataset and PennCOSYVIO dataset.</p></details> | 11 pages, 11 figures |
| **[AirLoop: Lifelong Loop Closure Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.08975v3)** | 2022-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Loop closure detection is an important building block that ensures the accuracy and robustness of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) systems. Due to their generalization ability, CNN-based approaches have received increasing attention. Although they normally benefit from training on datasets that are diverse and reflective of the environments, new environments often emerge after the model is deployed. It is therefore desirable to incorporate the data newly collected during operation for incremental learning. Nevertheless, simply finetuning the model on new data is infeasible since it may cause the model's performance on previously learned data to degrade over time, which is also known as the problem of catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we present AirLoop, a method that leverages techniques from lifelong learning to minimize forgetting when training loop closure detection models incrementally. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of AirLoop on TartanAir, Nordland, and RobotCar datasets. To the best of our knowledge, AirLoop is one of the first works to achieve lifelong learning of deep loop closure detectors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Modal Lidar Dataset for Benchmarking General-Purpose Localization and Mapping Algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03454v1)** | 2022-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lidar technology has evolved significantly over the last decade, with higher resolution, better accuracy, and lower cost devices available today. In addition, new scanning modalities and novel sensor technologies have emerged in recent years. Public datasets have enabled benchmarking of algorithms and have set standards for the cutting edge technology. However, existing datasets are not representative of the technological landscape, with only a reduced number of lidars available. This inherently limits the development and comparison of general-purpose algorithms in the evolving landscape. This paper presents a novel multi-modal lidar dataset with sensors showcasing different scanning modalities (spinning and solid-state), sensing technologies, and lidar cameras. The focus of the dataset is on low-drift odometry, with ground truth data available in both indoors and outdoors environment with sub-millimeter accuracy from a motion capture (MOCAP) system. For comparison in longer distances, we also include data recorded in larger spaces indoors and outdoors. The dataset contains point cloud data from spinning lidars and solid-state lidars. Also, it provides range images from high resolution spinning lidars, RGB and depth images from a lidar camera, and inertial data from built-in IMUs. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the lidar dataset with the most variety of sensors and environments where ground truth data is available. This dataset can be widely used in multiple research areas, such as 3D LiDAR simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), performance comparison between multi-modal lidars, appearance recognition and loop closure detection.

L3Ds are emerging compact representations of patches extracted from point clouds that are learnt from data using a deep learning algorithm. We propose a novel overlap measure for loop detection by computing the metric error between points that correspond to mutually-nearest-neighbour descriptors after registering the loop candidate point cloud by its estimated relative pose. This novel approach enables us to accurately detect loops and estimate six degrees-of-freedom poses in the case of small overlaps. We compare our L3D-based loop closure approach with recent approaches on LiDAR data and achieve state-of-the-art loop closure detection accuracy. Additionally, we embed our loop closure approach in RESLAM, a recent edge-based SLAM system, and perform the evaluation on real-world RGBD-TUM and synthetic ICL datasets. Our approach enables RESLAM to achieve a better localisation accuracy compared to its original loop closure strategy.

Over the years, several deep learning approaches have been proposed to address this task, however their performance has been subpar compared to handcrafted techniques, especially while dealing with reverse loops. In this paper, we introduce the novel LCDNet that effectively detects loop closures in LiDAR point clouds by simultaneously identifying previously visited places and estimating the 6-DoF relative transformation between the current scan and the map. LCDNet is composed of a shared encoder, a place recognition head that extracts global descriptors, and a relative pose head that estimates the transformation between two point clouds. We introduce a novel relative pose head based on the unbalanced optimal transport theory that we implement in a differentiable manner to allow for end-to-end training. Extensive evaluations of LCDNet on multiple real-world autonomous driving datasets show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art loop closure detection and point cloud registration techniques by a large margin, especially while dealing with reverse loops. Moreover, we integrate our proposed loop closure detection approach into a LiDAR SLAM library to provide a complete mapping system and demonstrate the generalization ability using different sensor setup in an unseen city.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Robotics (T-RO), 2022</p></details> |

However, mobile SLI systems for 360 degree 3D reconstruction demand 3D point cloud registration, involving high computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a phase based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (Phase-SLAM) framework for fast and accurate SLI sensor pose estimation and 3D object reconstruction. The novelty of this work is threefold: (1) developing a reprojection model from 3D points to 2D phase data towards phase registration with low computational complexity; (2) developing a local optimizer to achieve SLI sensor pose estimation (odometry) using the derived Jacobian matrix for the 6 DoF variables; (3) developing a compressive phase comparison method to achieve high-efficiency loop closure detection. The whole Phase-SLAM pipeline is then exploited using existing global pose graph optimization techniques. We build datasets from both the unreal simulation platform and a robotic arm based SLI system in real-world to verify the proposed approach. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed Phase-SLAM outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in terms of the efficiency and accuracy of pose estimation and 3D reconstruction.

However, it is still challenging to achieve high-level performance based on previously trained models in different geographical regions. This paper addresses the problem of their deployment with simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) systems in the new environment. The general baseline approach uses additional information, such as GPS, sequential keyframes tracking, and re-training the whole environment to enhance the recall rate. We propose a novel approach for improving image retrieval based on previously trained models. We present an intelligent method, MAQBOOL, to amplify the power of pre-trained models for better image recall and its application to real-time multiagent SLAM systems. We achieve comparable image retrieval results at a low descriptor dimension (512-D), compared to the high descriptor dimension (4096-D) of state-of-the-art methods. We use spatial information to improve the recall rate in image retrieval on pre-trained models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast and Incremental Loop Closure Detection with Deep Features and Proximity Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11703v2)** | 2022-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the robotics community has extensively examined methods concerning the place recognition task within the scope of simultaneous localization and mapping applications.This article proposes an appearance-based loop closure detection pipeline named ``FILD++" (Fast and Incremental Loop closure Detection).First, the system is fed by consecutive images and, via passing them twice through a single convolutional neural network, global and local deep features are extracted.Subsequently, a hierarchical navigable small-world graph incrementally constructs a visual database representing the robot's traversed path based on the computed global features.Finally, a query image, grabbed each time step, is set to retrieve similar locations on the traversed route.An image-to-image pairing follows, which exploits local features to evaluate the spatial information. Thus, in the proposed article, we propose a single network for global and local feature extraction in contrast to our previous work (FILD), while an exhaustive search for the verification process is adopted over the generated deep local features avoiding the utilization of hash codes. Exhaustive experiments on eleven publicly available datasets exhibit the system's high performance (achieving the highest recall score on eight of them) and low execution times (22.05 ms on average in New College, which is the largest one containing 52480 images) compared to other state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to Journal of Field Robotics</p></details> |
| **[A Universal LiDAR SLAM Accelerator System on Low-cost FPGA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.09523v2)** | 2021-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) serves as a basis for indoor cleaning, navigation, and many other useful applications in both industry and household. From a series of LiDAR scans, it constructs an accurate, globally consistent model of the environment and estimates a robot position inside it. SLAM is inherently computationally intensive; it is a challenging problem to realize a fast and reliable SLAM system on mobile robots with a limited processing capability. To overcome such hurdles, in this paper, we propose a universal, low-power, and resource-efficient accelerator design for 2D LiDAR SLAM targeting resource-limited FPGAs. As scan matching is at the heart of SLAM, the proposed accelerator consists of dedicated scan matching cores on the programmable logic part, and provides software interfaces to facilitate the use. Our accelerator can be integrated to various SLAM methods including the ROS (Robot Operating System)-based ones, and users can switch to a different method without modifying and re-synthesizing the logic part. We integrate the accelerator into three widely-used methods, i.e., scan matching, particle filter, and graph-based SLAM. We evaluate the design in terms of resource utilization, speed, and quality of output results using real-world datasets. Experiment results on a Pynq-Z2 board demonstrate that our design accelerates scan matching and loop-closure detection tasks by up to 14.84x and 18.92x, yielding 4.67x, 4.00x, and 4.06x overall performance improvement in the above methods, respectively. Our design enables the real-time performance while consuming only 2.4W and maintaining accuracy, which is comparable to the software counterparts and even the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

While the problem becomes considerably more challenging when matching should be done jointly across multiple, multimodal sets of data, the robustness and accuracy of matching in the presence of noise and outliers can be greatly improved in this setting. At present, multimodal techniques do not leverage multiway information, and multiway techniques do not incorporate different modalities, leading to inferior results. In contrast, we present a principled mixed-integer quadratic framework to address this issue. We use a novel continuous relaxation in a projected gradient descent algorithm that guarantees feasible solutions of the integer program are obtained efficiently. We demonstrate experimentally that correspondences obtained from our approach are more stable to noise and errors than state-of-the-art techniques. Tested on a robotics dataset, our algorithm resulted in a 35% increase in F1 score when compared to the best alternative.</p></details> | <details><summary>prese...</summary><p>presented in ICRA 2021 Workshop on Robust Perception for Autonomous Field Robots in Challenging Environments</p></details> |

We propose Deep Scan Context (DSC), a general and discriminative global descriptor that captures the relationship among segments of a point cloud. Unlike previous methods that utilize either semantics or a sequence of adjacent point clouds for better place recognition, we only use raw point clouds to get competitive results. Concretely, we first segment the point cloud egocentrically to acquire centroids and eigenvalues of the segments. Then, we introduce a graph neural network to aggregate these features into an embedding representation. Extensive experiments conducted on the KITTI dataset show that DSC is robust to scene variants and outperforms existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Average Outward Flux Skeletons for Environment Mapping and Topology Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.13826v1)** | 2021-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider how to directly extract a road map (also known as a topological representation) of an initially-unknown 2-dimensional environment via an online procedure that robustly computes a retraction of its boundaries. In this article, we first present the online construction of a topological map and the implementation of a control law for guiding the robot to the nearest unexplored area, first presented in [1]. The proposed method operates by allowing the robot to localize itself on a partially constructed map, calculate a path to unexplored parts of the environment (frontiers), compute a robust terminating condition when the robot has fully explored the environment, and achieve loop closure detection. The proposed algorithm results in smooth safe paths for the robot's navigation needs. The presented approach is any time algorithm that has the advantage that it allows for the active creation of topological maps from laser scan data, as it is being acquired. We also propose a navigation strategy based on a heuristic where the robot is directed towards nodes in the topological map that open to empty space. We then extend the work in [1] by presenting a topology matching algorithm that leverages the strengths of a particular spectral correspondence method [2], to match the mapped environments generated from our topology-making algorithm. Here, we concentrated on implementing a system that could be used to match the topologies of the mapped environment by using AOF Skeletons. In topology matching between two given maps and their AOF skeletons, we first find correspondences between points on the AOF skeletons of two different environments. We then align the (2D) points of the environments themselves. We also compute a distance measure between two given environments, based on their extracted AOF skeletons and their topology, as the sum of the matching errors between corresponding points.</p></details> |  |

Many state-of-the-art loop closure detection (LCD) algorithms use visual Bag-of-Words (vBoW), which is robust against partial occlusions in a scene but cannot perceive the semantics or spatial relationships between feature points. CNN object extraction can address those issues, by providing semantic labels and spatial relationships between objects in a scene. Previous work has mainly focused on replacing vBoW with CNN-derived features. In this paper, we propose SymbioLCD, a novel ensemble-based LCD that utilizes both CNN-extracted objects and vBoW features for LCD candidate prediction. When used in tandem, the added elements of object semantics and spatial-awareness create a more robust and symbiotic loop closure detection system. The proposed SymbioLCD uses scale-invariant spatial and semantic matching, Hausdorff distance with temporal constraints, and a Random Forest that utilizes combined information from both CNN-extracted objects and vBoW features for predicting accurate loop closure candidates. Evaluation of the proposed method shows it outperforms other Machine Learning (ML) algorithms - such as SVM, Decision Tree and Neural Network, and demonstrates that there is a strong symbiosis between CNN-extracted object information and vBoW features which assists accurate LCD candidate prediction. Furthermore, it is able to perceive loop closure candidates earlier than state-of-the-art SLAM algorithms, utilizing added spatial and semantic information from CNN-extracted objects.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages.

Contrarily to urban or man-made environments, where the presence of unique objects and structures offer unique cues for localization, the appearance of unstructured natural environments is often ambiguous and self-similar, hindering the performances of loop closure detection. In this paper, we present an approach to improve the robustness of place recognition in the context of a submap-based stereo SLAM based on Gaussian Process Gradient Maps (GPGMaps). GPGMaps embed a continuous representation of the gradients of the local terrain elevation by means of Gaussian Process regression and Structured Kernel Interpolation, given solely noisy elevation measurements. We leverage the image-like structure of GPGMaps to detect loop closures using traditional visual features and Bag of Words. GPGMap matching is performed as an SE(2) alignment to establish loop closure constraints within a pose graph. We evaluate the proposed pipeline on a variety of datasets recorded on Mt. Etna, Sicily and in the Morocco desert, respectively Moon- and Mars-like environments, and we compare the localization performances with state-of-the-art approaches for visual SLAM and visual loop closure detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submission to Field Robotics (www.journalfieldrobotics.org), under review</p></details> |

While significant progress has been made through this track, under more challenging configuration for monocular VSLAM, e.g., varying illumination, the performance of state-of-the-art systems generally degrades. As a consequence, robustness and accuracy for monocular VSLAM are still widely concerned. This paper presents a monocular VSLAM system that fully exploits learnt features for better state estimation. The proposed system leverages both learnt local features and global embeddings at different modules of the system: direct camera pose estimation, inter-frame feature association, and loop closure detection. With a probabilistic explanation of keypoint prediction, we formulate the camera pose tracking in a direct manner and parameterize local features with uncertainty taken into account. To alleviate the quantization effect, we adapt the mapping module to generate 3D landmarks better to guarantee the system's robustness. Detecting temporal loop closure via deep global embeddings further improves the robustness and accuracy of the proposed system. The proposed system is extensively evaluated on public datasets (Tsukuba, EuRoC, and KITTI), and compared against the state-of-the-art methods. The competitive performance of camera pose estimation confirms the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Auton...</summary><p>Autonomous Robots; 14 pages, 9 figures; project homepage: https://hyhuang1995.github.io/dgvslam/</p></details> |

As one of the most effective and efficient solutions, Bag-of-Words (BoW) builds a visual vocabulary to associate features and then detect loops. Most existing approaches that build vocabularies off-line determine scales of the vocabulary by trial-and-error, which often results in unreasonable feature association. Moreover, the accuracy of the algorithm usually declines due to perceptual aliasing, as the BoW-based method ignores the positions of visual features. To overcome these disadvantages, we propose a natural convergence criterion based on the comparison between the radii of nodes and the drifts of feature descriptors, which is then utilized to build the optimal vocabulary automatically. Furthermore, we present a novel topological graph verification method for validating candidate loops so that geometrical positions of the words can be involved with a negligible increase in complexity, which can significantly improve the accuracy of LCD. Experiments on various public datasets and comparisons against several state-of-the-art algorithms verify the performance of our proposed approach.</p></details> | 11 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Probabilistic Appearance-Invariant Topometric Localization with New Place Awareness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07707v1)** | 2021-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Probabilistic state-estimation approaches offer a principled foundation for designing localization systems, because they naturally integrate sequences of imperfect motion and exteroceptive sensor data. Recently, probabilistic localization systems utilizing appearance-invariant visual place recognition (VPR) methods as the primary exteroceptive sensor have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in the presence of substantial appearance change. However, existing systems 1) do not fully utilize odometry data within the motion models, and 2) are unable to handle route deviations, due to the assumption that query traverses exactly repeat the mapping traverse. To address these shortcomings, we present a new probabilistic topometric localization system which incorporates full 3-dof odometry into the motion model and furthermore, adds an "off-map" state within the state-estimation framework, allowing query traverses which feature significant route detours from the reference map to be successfully localized. We perform extensive evaluation on multiple query traverses from the Oxford RobotCar dataset exhibiting both significant appearance change and deviations from routes previously traversed. In particular, we evaluate performance on two practically relevant localization tasks: loop closure detection and global localization. Our approach achieves major performance improvements over both existing and improved state-of-the-art systems.</p></details> | 8 pages |

In some cases, a robot needs to work in the same environment. Such applications give rise to the problem of a life-long SLAM system. Life-long SLAM presents two main challenges i.e. the tracking should not fail in a dynamic environment and the need for a robust and efficient mapping strategy. The system should update maps with new information; while also keeping track of older observations. But, mapping for a long time can require higher computational requirements. In this paper, we propose a solution to the problem of life-long SLAM. We represent the global map as a set of rasterized images of local maps along with a map management system responsible for updating local maps and keeping track of older values. We also present an efficient approach of using the bag of visual words method for loop closure detection and relocalization. We evaluate the performance of our system on the KITTI dataset and an indoor dataset. Our loop closure system reported recall and precision of above 90 percent. The computational cost of our system is much lower as compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our method reports lower computational requirements even for long-term operation.</p></details> |  |

With the development of 3D semantic segmentation for point cloud, semantic information can be obtained conveniently and steadily, essential for high-level intelligence and conductive to SLAM. In this paper, we present a novel semantic-aided LiDAR SLAM with loop closure based on LOAM, named SA-LOAM, which leverages semantics in odometry as well as loop closure detection. Specifically, we propose a semantic-assisted ICP, including semantically matching, downsampling and plane constraint, and integrates a semantic graph-based place recognition method in our loop closure detection module. Benefitting from semantics, we can improve the localization accuracy, detect loop closures effectively, and construct a global consistent semantic map even in large-scale scenes. Extensive experiments on KITTI and Ford Campus dataset show that our system significantly improves baseline performance, has generalization ability to unseen data and achieves competitive results compared with state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages.

However, recent advancements in VPR methods have significantly improved performance, challenging the necessity of re-ranking. In this work, we show that modern retrieval systems often reach a point where re-ranking can degrade results, as current VPR datasets are largely saturated. We propose using image matching as a verification step to assess retrieval confidence, demonstrating that inlier counts can reliably predict when re-ranking is beneficial. Our findings shift the paradigm of retrieval pipelines, offering insights for more robust and adaptive VPR systems.

| **[Visual Re-Ranking with Non-Visual Side Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11134v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The standard approach for visual place recognition is to use global image descriptors to retrieve the most similar database images for a given query image. The results can then be further improved with re-ranking methods that re-order the top scoring images. However, existing methods focus on re-ranking based on the same image descriptors that were used for the initial retrieval, which we argue provides limited additional signal. In this work we propose Generalized Contextual Similarity Aggregation (GCSA), which is a graph neural network-based re-ranking method that, in addition to the visual descriptors, can leverage other types of available side information. This can for example be other sensor data (such as signal strength of nearby WiFi or BlueTooth endpoints) or geometric properties such as camera poses for database images. In many applications this information is already present or can be acquired with low effort. Our architecture leverages the concept of affinity vectors to allow for a shared encoding of the heterogeneous multi-modal input. Two large-scale datasets, covering both outdoor and indoor localization scenarios, are utilized for training and evaluation. In experiments we show significant improvement not only on image retrieval metrics, but also for the downstream visual localization task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Scandinavian Conference on Image Analysis (SCIA) 2025</p></details> |
| **[Focus on Local: Finding Reliable Discriminative Regions for Visual Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09881v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is aimed at predicting the location of a query image by referencing a database of geotagged images. For VPR task, often fewer discriminative local regions in an image produce important effects while mundane background regions do not contribute or even cause perceptual aliasing because of easy overlap. However, existing methods lack precisely modeling and full exploitation of these discriminative regions. In this paper, we propose the Focus on Local (FoL) approach to stimulate the performance of image retrieval and re-ranking in VPR simultaneously by mining and exploiting reliable discriminative local regions in images and introducing pseudo-correlation supervision. First, we design two losses, Extraction-Aggregation Spatial Alignment Loss (SAL) and Foreground-Background Contrast Enhancement Loss (CEL), to explicitly model reliable discriminative local regions and use them to guide the generation of global representations and efficient re-ranking. Second, we introduce a weakly-supervised local feature training strategy based on pseudo-correspondences obtained from aggregating global features to alleviate the lack of local correspondences ground truth for the VPR task. Third, we suggest an efficient re-ranking pipeline that is efficiently and precisely based on discriminative region guidance. Finally, experimental results show that our FoL achieves the state-of-the-art on multiple VPR benchmarks in both image retrieval and re-ranking stages and also significantly outperforms existing two-stage VPR methods in terms of computational efficiency.

| **[Distillation Improves Visual Place Recognition for Low Quality Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06906v3)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time visual localization often utilizes online computing, for which query images or videos are transmitted to remote servers for visual place recognition (VPR). However, limited network bandwidth necessitates image-quality reduction and thus the degradation of global image descriptors, reducing VPR accuracy. We address this issue at the descriptor extraction level with a knowledge-distillation methodology that learns feature representations from high-quality images to extract more discriminative descriptors from low-quality images. Our approach includes the Inter-channel Correlation Knowledge Distillation (ICKD) loss, Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss, and Triplet loss. We validate the proposed losses on multiple VPR methods and datasets subjected to JPEG compression, resolution reduction, and video quantization. We obtain significant improvements in VPR recall rates under all three tested modalities of lowered image quality. Furthermore, we fill a gap in VPR literature on video-based data and its influence on VPR performance. This work contributes to more reliable place recognition in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[StructVPR++: Distill Structural and Semantic Knowledge with Weighting Samples for Visual Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06601v2)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual place recognition is a challenging task for autonomous driving and robotics, which is usually considered as an image retrieval problem. A commonly used two-stage strategy involves global retrieval followed by re-ranking using patch-level descriptors. Most deep learning-based methods in an end-to-end manner cannot extract global features with sufficient semantic information from RGB images. In contrast, re-ranking can utilize more explicit structural and semantic information in one-to-one matching process, but it is time-consuming. To bridge the gap between global retrieval and re-ranking and achieve a good trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, we propose StructVPR++, a framework that embeds structural and semantic knowledge into RGB global representations via segmentation-guided distillation. Our key innovation lies in decoupling label-specific features from global descriptors, enabling explicit semantic alignment between image pairs without requiring segmentation during deployment. Furthermore, we introduce a sample-wise weighted distillation strategy that prioritizes reliable training pairs while suppressing noisy ones. Experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that StructVPR++ surpasses state-of-the-art global methods by 5-23% in Recall@1 and even outperforms many two-stage approaches, achieving real-time efficiency with a single RGB input.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by T-PAMI2025</p></details> |

However, most existing VPR datasets are limited to single-viewpoint scenarios, leading to reduced recognition accuracy, particularly in multi-directional driving or feature-sparse scenes. Moreover, obtaining additional data to mitigate these limitations is often expensive. This paper introduces a novel training paradigm to improve the performance of existing VPR networks by enhancing multi-view diversity within current datasets through uncertainty estimation and NeRF-based data augmentation. Specifically, we initially train NeRF using the existing VPR dataset. Then, our devised self-supervised uncertainty estimation network identifies places with high uncertainty. The poses of these uncertain places are input into NeRF to generate new synthetic observations for further training of VPR networks. Additionally, we propose an improved storage method for efficient organization of augmented and original training data. We conducted extensive experiments on three datasets and tested three different VPR backbone networks. The results demonstrate that our proposed training paradigm significantly improves VPR performance by fully utilizing existing data, outperforming other training approaches. We further validated the effectiveness of our approach on self-recorded indoor and outdoor datasets, consistently demonstrating superior results.

Our paper highlights three advancements for SNNs in Visual Place Recognition (VPR). Firstly, we propose Modular SNNs, where each SNN represents a set of non-overlapping geographically distinct places, enabling scalable networks for large environments. Secondly, we present Ensembles of Modular SNNs, where multiple networks represent the same place, significantly enhancing accuracy compared to single-network models. Each of our Modular SNN modules is compact, comprising only 1500 neurons and 474k synapses, making them ideally suited for ensembling due to their small size. Lastly, we investigate the role of sequence matching in SNN-based VPR, a technique where consecutive images are used to refine place recognition. We demonstrate competitive performance of our method on a range of datasets, including higher responsiveness to ensembling compared to conventional VPR techniques and higher R@1 improvements with sequence matching than VPR techniques with comparable baseline performance. Our contributions highlight the viability of SNNs for VPR, offering scalable and robust solutions, and paving the way for their application in various energy-sensitive robotic tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 10 figures, IEEE Transactions on Robotics (TRO)</p></details> |

Existing visual place recognition (VPR) methods, which typically rely on global descriptors or aggregate local features, often struggle in cluttered indoor environments densely populated with man-made objects. These methods tend to overlook the crucial role of object-oriented information. To address this, we propose AirRoom, an object-aware pipeline that integrates multi-level object-oriented information-from global context to object patches, object segmentation, and keypoints-utilizing a coarse-to-fine retrieval approach. Extensive experiments on four newly constructed datasets-MPReID, HMReID, GibsonReID, and ReplicaReID-demonstrate that AirRoom outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) models across nearly all evaluation metrics, with improvements ranging from 6% to 80%. Moreover, AirRoom exhibits significant flexibility, allowing various modules within the pipeline to be substituted with different alternatives without compromising overall performance.

One of the possible approaches suitable for such environments is appearance-based teach-and-repeat navigation, relying on simplified localization and reactive robot motion control - all without a need for standard mapping. This work brings an innovative solution to such a system based on visual place recognition techniques. Here, the major contributions stand in the employment of a new visual place recognition technique, a novel horizontal shift computation approach, and a multi-platform system design for applications across various types of mobile robots. Secondly, a new public dataset for experimental testing of appearance-based navigation methods is introduced. Moreover, the work also provides real-world experimental testing and performance comparison of the introduced navigation system against other state-of-the-art methods. The results confirm that the new system outperforms existing methods in several testing scenarios, is capable of operation indoors and outdoors, and exhibits robustness to day and night scene variations.</p></details> | 6 pages, 5 figures |
| **[CQVPR: Landmark-aware Contextual Queries for Visual Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08170v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Place Recognition (VPR) aims to estimate the location of the given query image within a database of geo-tagged images. To identify the exact location in an image, detecting landmarks is crucial. However, in some scenarios, such as urban environments, there are numerous landmarks, such as various modern buildings, and the landmarks in different cities often exhibit high visual similarity. Therefore, it is essential not only to leverage the landmarks but also to consider the contextual information surrounding them, such as whether there are trees, roads, or other features around the landmarks. We propose the Contextual Query VPR (CQVPR), which integrates contextual information with detailed pixel-level visual features. By leveraging a set of learnable contextual queries, our method automatically learns the high-level contexts with respect to landmarks and their surrounding areas. Heatmaps depicting regions that each query attends to serve as context-aware features, offering cues that could enhance the understanding of each scene. We further propose a query matching loss to supervise the extraction process of contextual queries. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, especially in challenging scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Visual Place Recognition with Sequence-Matching Receptiveness Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06840v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In visual place recognition (VPR), filtering and sequence-based matching approaches can improve performance by integrating temporal information across image sequences, especially in challenging conditions. While these methods are commonly applied, their effects on system behavior can be unpredictable and can actually make performance worse in certain situations. In this work, we present a new supervised learning approach that learns to predict the per-frame sequence matching receptiveness (SMR) of VPR techniques, enabling the system to selectively decide when to trust the output of a sequence matching system. The approach is agnostic to the underlying VPR technique. Our approach predicts SMR-and hence significantly improves VPR performance-across a large range of state-of-the-art and classical VPR techniques (namely CosPlace, MixVPR, EigenPlaces, SALAD, AP-GeM, NetVLAD and SAD), and across three benchmark VPR datasets (Nordland, Oxford RobotCar, and SFU-Mountain). We also provide insights into a complementary approach that uses the predictor to replace discarded matches, as well as ablation studies, including an analysis of the interactions between our SMR predictor and the selected sequence length. We will release our code upon acceptance.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, under review</p></details> |
| **[TextInPlace: Indoor Visual Place Recognition in Repetitive Structures with Scene Text Spotting and Verification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06501v1)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is a crucial capability for long-term autonomous robots, enabling them to identify previously visited locations using visual information. However, existing methods remain limited in indoor settings due to the highly repetitive structures inherent in such environments. We observe that scene text typically appears in indoor spaces, serving to distinguish visually similar but different places. This inspires us to propose TextInPlace, a simple yet effective VPR framework that integrates Scene Text Spotting (STS) to mitigate visual perceptual ambiguity in repetitive indoor environments. Specifically, TextInPlace adopts a dual-branch architecture within a local parameter sharing network. The VPR branch employs attention-based aggregation to extract global descriptors for coarse-grained retrieval, while the STS branch utilizes a bridging text spotter to detect and recognize scene text. Finally, the discriminative text is filtered to compute text similarity and re-rank the top-K retrieved images. To bridge the gap between current text-based repetitive indoor scene datasets and the typical scenarios encountered in robot navigation, we establish an indoor VPR benchmark dataset, called Maze-with-Text. Extensive experiments on both custom and public datasets demonstrate that TextInPlace achieves superior performance over existing methods that rely solely on appearance information. The dataset, code, and trained models are publicly available at https://github.com/HqiTao/TextInPlace.</p></details> | 8 pages,5 figures |
| **[Bridging Text and Vision: A Multi-View Text-Vision Registration Approach for Cross-Modal Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14195v2)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mobile robots necessitate advanced natural language understanding capabilities to accurately identify locations and perform tasks such as package delivery. However, traditional visual place recognition (VPR) methods rely solely on single-view visual information and cannot interpret human language descriptions. To overcome this challenge, we bridge text and vision by proposing a multiview (360{\deg} views of the surroundings) text-vision registration approach called Text4VPR for place recognition task, which is the first method that exclusively utilizes textual descriptions to match a database of images. Text4VPR employs the frozen T5 language model to extract global textual embeddings. Additionally, it utilizes the Sinkhorn algorithm with temperature coefficient to assign local tokens to their respective clusters, thereby aggregating visual descriptors from images. During the training stage, Text4VPR emphasizes the alignment between individual text-image pairs for precise textual description. In the inference stage, Text4VPR uses the Cascaded Cross-Attention Cosine Alignment (CCCA) to address the internal mismatch between text and image groups. Subsequently, Text4VPR performs precisely place match based on the descriptions of text-image groups. On Street360Loc, the first text to image VPR dataset we created, Text4VPR builds a robust baseline, achieving a leading top-1 accuracy of 57% and a leading top-10 accuracy of 92% within a 5-meter radius on the test set, which indicates that localization from textual descriptions to images is not only feasible but also holds significant potential for further advancement, as shown in Figure 1.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, conference</p></details> |

However, automating underwater ecosystem management with robotic platforms remains challenging due to the complexities of underwater imagery, which pose significant difficulties for traditional visual localization methods. We propose an integrated pipeline that combines Visual Place Recognition (VPR), feature matching, and image segmentation on video-derived images. This method enables robust identification of revisited areas, estimation of rigid transformations, and downstream analysis of ecosystem changes. Furthermore, we introduce the SQUIDLE+ VPR Benchmark-the first large-scale underwater VPR benchmark designed to leverage an extensive collection of unstructured data from multiple robotic platforms, spanning time intervals from days to years.

Although Vision Transformer (ViT) solutions deliver high accuracy, their large models often exceed the memory and compute budgets of resource-constrained platforms such as drones and mobile robots. To address this issue, we propose TeTRA, a ternary transformer approach that progressively quantizes the ViT backbone to 2-bit precision and binarizes its final embedding layer, offering substantial reductions in model size and latency. A carefully designed progressive distillation strategy preserves the representational power of a full-precision teacher, allowing TeTRA to retain or even surpass the accuracy of uncompressed convolutional counterparts, despite using fewer resources. Experiments on standard VPR benchmarks demonstrate that TeTRA reduces memory consumption by up to 69% compared to efficient baselines, while lowering inference latency by 35%, with either no loss or a slight improvement in recall@1. These gains enable high-accuracy VPR on power-constrained, memory-limited robotic platforms, making TeTRA an appealing solution for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |

However, existing CL methods often focus on knowledge transfer from a known model to a new one, overlooking the existence of unknown black-box models. We explore a novel multi-robot CL approach that enables knowledge transfer from black-box VPR models (teachers), such as those of local robots encountered by traveler robots (students) in unknown environments. Specifically, we introduce Membership Inference Attack, or MIA, the only major privacy attack applicable to black-box models, and leverage it to reconstruct pseudo training sets, which serve as the key knowledge to be exchanged between robots, from black-box VPR models. Furthermore, we aim to overcome the inherently low sampling efficiency of MIA by leveraging insights on place class prediction distribution and un-learned class detection imported from the VPR literature as a prior distribution. We also analyze both the individual effects of these methods and their combined impact. Experimental results demonstrate that our black-box MIA (BB-MIA) approach is remarkably powerful despite its simplicity, significantly enhancing the VPR capability of lower-performing robots through brief communication with other robots. This study contributes to optimizing knowledge sharing between robots in VPR and enhancing autonomy in open-world environments with multi-robot systems that are fault-tolerant and scalable.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, technical report</p></details> |

The pair classifier can predict whether a given pair of images are from the same place or not. The network only comprises Vision Transformer components for both the encoder and the pair classifier, and both components are trained using their respective class tokens. In existing VPR methods, typically the network is initialized using pre-trained weights from a generic image dataset such as ImageNet. In this work we propose an alternative pre-training strategy, by using Siamese Masked Image Modelling as a pre-training task. We propose a Place-aware image sampling procedure from a collection of large VPR datasets for pre-training our model, to learn visual features tuned specifically for VPR. By re-using the Mask Image Modelling encoder and decoder weights in the second stage of training, Pair-VPR can achieve state-of-the-art VPR performance across five benchmark datasets with a ViT-B encoder, along with further improvements in localization recall with larger encoders.

Compared to single-modal VPR, this approach benefits from the widespread availability of RGB cameras and the robustness of point clouds in providing accurate spatial geometry and distance information. However, current methods rely on intermediate modalities that capture either the vertical or horizontal field of view, limiting their ability to fully exploit the complementary information from both sensors. In this work, we propose an innovative initial retrieval + re-rank method that effectively combines information from range (or RGB) images and Bird's Eye View (BEV) images. Our approach relies solely on a computationally efficient global descriptor similarity search process to achieve re-ranking. Additionally, we introduce a novel similarity label supervision technique to maximize the utility of limited training data. Specifically, we employ points average distance to approximate appearance similarity and incorporate an adaptive margin, based on similarity differences, into the vanilla triplet loss. Experimental results on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[SciceVPR: Stable Cross-Image Correlation Enhanced Model for Visual Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20676v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is a major challenge for robotics and autonomous systems, with the goal of predicting the location of an image based solely on its visual features. State-of-the-art (SOTA) models extract global descriptors using the powerful foundation model DINOv2 as backbone. These models either explore the cross-image correlation or propose a time-consuming two-stage re-ranking strategy to achieve better performance. However, existing works only utilize the final output of DINOv2, and the current cross-image correlation causes unstable retrieval results. To produce both discriminative and constant global descriptors, this paper proposes stable cross-image correlation enhanced model for VPR called SciceVPR. This model explores the full potential of DINOv2 in providing useful feature representations that implicitly encode valuable contextual knowledge. Specifically, SciceVPR first uses a multi-layer feature fusion module to capture increasingly detailed task-relevant channel and spatial information from the multi-layer output of DINOv2. Secondly, SciceVPR considers the invariant correlation between images within a batch as valuable knowledge to be distilled into the proposed self-enhanced encoder. In this way, SciceVPR can acquire fairly robust global features regardless of domain shifts (e.g., changes in illumination, weather and viewpoint between pictures taken in the same place). Experimental results demonstrate that the base variant, SciceVPR-B, outperforms SOTA one-stage methods with single input on multiple datasets with varying domain conditions. The large variant, SciceVPR-L, performs on par with SOTA two-stage models, scoring over 3% higher in Recall@1 compared to existing models on the challenging Tokyo24/7 dataset. Our code will be released at https://github.com/shuimushan/SciceVPR.</p></details> |  |

However, existing solutions are built to specifically work for one of these tasks, and are known to fail when the requirements slightly change or when they meet out-of-distribution data. In this paper we combine a variety of existing methods, training techniques, and datasets to train a retrieval model, called MegaLoc, that is performant on multiple tasks. We find that MegaLoc (1) achieves state of the art on a large number of Visual Place Recognition datasets, (2) impressive results on common Landmark Retrieval datasets, and (3) sets a new state of the art for Visual Localization on the LaMAR datasets, where we only changed the retrieval method to the existing localization pipeline.

In our previous work, we propose a novel method to realize seamless adaptation of foundation models to VPR (SelaVPR). This method can produce both global and local features that focus on discriminative landmarks to recognize places for two-stage VPR by a parameter-efficient adaptation approach. Although SelaVPR has achieved competitive results, we argue that the previous adaptation is inefficient in training time and GPU memory usage, and the re-ranking paradigm is also costly in retrieval latency and storage usage. In pursuit of higher efficiency and better performance, we propose an extension of the SelaVPR, called SelaVPR++. Concretely, we first design a parameter-, time-, and memory-efficient adaptation method that uses lightweight multi-scale convolution (MultiConv) adapters to refine intermediate features from the frozen foundation backbone. This adaptation method does not back-propagate gradients through the backbone during training, and the MultiConv adapter facilitates feature interactions along the spatial axes and introduces proper local priors, thus achieving higher efficiency and better performance. Moreover, we propose an innovative re-ranking paradigm for more efficient VPR. Instead of relying on local features for re-ranking, which incurs huge overhead in latency and storage, we employ compact binary features for initial retrieval and robust floating-point (global) features for re-ranking. To obtain such binary features, we propose a similarity-constrained deep hashing method, which can be easily integrated into the VPR pipeline. Finally, we improve our training strategy and unify the training protocol of several common training datasets to merge them for better training of VPR models. Extensive experiments show that ......</p></details> |  |

However, acquiring such datasets is time-consuming, costly, and sometimes unfeasible. To address these limitations, the use of synthetic data has gained attention as a viable alternative, allowing researchers to generate vast amounts of data while simulating various environmental contexts in a controlled setting. In this study, we investigate the use of synthetic data in robotics and navigation, specifically focusing on Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and Visual Place Recognition (VPR). In particular, we introduce a synthetic dataset created using the virtual environment of the video game Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V), along with an algorithm designed to generate a VPR dataset, without human supervision. Through a series of experiments centered on SLAM and VPR, we demonstrate that synthetic data derived from GTA V are qualitatively comparable to real-world data. Furthermore, these synthetic data can complement or even substitute real-world data in these applications. This study sets the stage for the creation of large-scale synthetic datasets, offering a cost-effective and scalable solution for future research and development.</p></details> |  |

It enables the systems to robustly localize themselves in large-scale environments. Existing VPR methods demonstrate attractive performance at the cost of heavy pre-training and limited generalizability. When deployed in unseen environments, these methods exhibit significant performance drops. Targeting this issue, we present VIPeR, a novel approach for visual incremental place recognition with the ability to adapt to new environments while retaining the performance of previous environments. We first introduce an adaptive mining strategy that balances the performance within a single environment and the generalizability across multiple environments. Then, to prevent catastrophic forgetting in lifelong learning, we draw inspiration from human memory systems and design a novel memory bank for our VIPeR. Our memory bank contains a sensory memory, a working memory and a long-term memory, with the first two focusing on the current environment and the last one for all previously visited environments. Additionally, we propose a probabilistic knowledge distillation to explicitly safeguard the previously learned knowledge. We evaluate our proposed VIPeR on three large-scale datasets, namely Oxford Robotcar, Nordland, and TartanAir. For comparison, we first set a baseline performance with naive finetuning. Then, several more recent lifelong learning methods are compared. Our VIPeR achieves better performance in almost all aspects with the biggest improvement of 13.65% in average performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures.

| **[Learning Street View Representations with Spatiotemporal Contrast](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04638v1)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Street view imagery is extensively utilized in representation learning for urban visual environments, supporting various sustainable development tasks such as environmental perception and socio-economic assessment. However, it is challenging for existing image representations to specifically encode the dynamic urban environment (such as pedestrians, vehicles, and vegetation), the built environment (including buildings, roads, and urban infrastructure), and the environmental ambiance (such as the cultural and socioeconomic atmosphere) depicted in street view imagery to address downstream tasks related to the city. In this work, we propose an innovative self-supervised learning framework that leverages temporal and spatial attributes of street view imagery to learn image representations of the dynamic urban environment for diverse downstream tasks. By employing street view images captured at the same location over time and spatially nearby views at the same time, we construct contrastive learning tasks designed to learn the temporal-invariant characteristics of the built environment and the spatial-invariant neighborhood ambiance. Our approach significantly outperforms traditional supervised and unsupervised methods in tasks such as visual place recognition, socioeconomic estimation, and human-environment perception. Moreover, we demonstrate the varying behaviors of image representations learned through different contrastive learning objectives across various downstream tasks. This study systematically discusses representation learning strategies for urban studies based on street view images, providing a benchmark that enhances the applicability of visual data in urban science.

We propose a strategy to align the input sensor modalities by leveraging stereo image streams to produce metric depth predictions with pose information, followed by fusing multiple scene views from a local window using a probabilistic occupancy framework to expand the limited field-of-view of the camera. Additionally, SOLVR adopts a flexible definition of what constitutes positive examples for different training losses, allowing us to simultaneously optimise place recognition and registration performance. Furthermore, we replace RANSAC with a registration function that weights a simple least-squares fitting with the estimated inlier likelihood of sparse keypoint correspondences, improving performance in scenarios with a low inlier ratio between the query and retrieved place. Our experiments on the KITTI and KITTI360 datasets show that SOLVR achieves state-of-the-art performance for LiDAR-Visual place recognition and registration, particularly improving registration accuracy over larger distances between the query and retrieved place.</p></details> | Accepted to ICRA2025 |

Recent studies in VPR have highlighted the significant advantage of employing pre-trained foundation models like DINOv2 for the VPR task. However, these models are often deemed inadequate for VPR without further fine-tuning on VPR-specific data. In this paper, we present an effective approach to harness the potential of a foundation model for VPR. We show that features extracted from self-attention layers can act as a powerful re-ranker for VPR, even in a zero-shot setting. Our method not only outperforms previous zero-shot approaches but also introduces results competitive with several supervised methods. We then show that a single-stage approach utilizing internal ViT layers for pooling can produce global features that achieve state-of-the-art performance, with impressive feature compactness down to 128D. Moreover, integrating our local foundation features for re-ranking further widens this performance gap. Our method also demonstrates exceptional robustness and generalization, setting new state-of-the-art performance, while handling challenging conditions such as occlusion, day-night transitions, and seasonal variations.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

While cost-effective and easily deployed, camera sensors are sensitive to lighting and weather changes, and even slight image alterations can greatly affect VPR efficiency and precision. Existing methods overcome this by exploiting powerful yet large networks, leading to significant consumption of computational resources. In this paper, we propose a high-performance teacher and lightweight student distillation framework called TSCM. It exploits our devised cross-metric knowledge distillation to narrow the performance gap between the teacher and student models, maintaining superior performance while enabling minimal computational load during deployment. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on large-scale datasets, namely Pittsburgh30k and Pittsburgh250k. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method over baseline models in terms of recognition accuracy and model parameter efficiency.

However, tracking loss can lead to the creation of disjoint submaps in multimap SLAM systems like ORB-SLAM3. Because of that, these systems employ submap merging strategies. As we show, these strategies are not always successful. In this paper, we investigate the impact of using modern VPR approaches for submap merging in visual SLAM. We argue that classical evaluation metrics are not sufficient to estimate the impact of a modern VPR component on the overall system. We show that naively replacing the VPR component does not leverage its full potential without requiring substantial interference in the original system. Because of that, we present a post-processing pipeline along with a set of metrics that allow us to estimate the impact of modern VPR components. We evaluate our approach on the NCLT and Newer College datasets using ORB-SLAM3 with NetVLAD and HDC-DELF as VPR components. Additionally, we present a simple approach for combining VPR with temporal consistency for map merging. We show that the map merging performance of ORB-SLAM3 can be improved. Building on these results, researchers in VPR can assess the potential of their approaches for SLAM systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at TAROS 2024.

While global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) provide low-cost and reliable positioning services, they are often hindered in complex urban canyon environments. Thus, exploring opportunistic signals for positioning in urban areas has become a key solution. Augmented reality (AR) allows pedestrians to acquire real-time visual information. Accordingly, we propose a low-cost visual-inertial positioning solution. This method comprises a lightweight multi-scale group convolution (MSGC)-based visual place recognition (VPR) neural network, a pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) algorithm, and a visual/inertial fusion approach based on a Kalman filter with gross error suppression. The VPR serves as a conditional observation to the Kalman filter, effectively correcting the errors accumulated through the PDR method. This enables the entire algorithm to ensure the reliability of long-term positioning in GNSS-denied areas. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method maintains stable positioning during large-scale movements. Compared to the lightweight MobileNetV3-based VPR method, our proposed VPR solution improves Recall@1 by at least 3\% on two public datasets while reducing the number of parameters by 63.37\%. It also achieves performance that is comparable to the VGG16-based method. The VPR-PDR algorithm improves localization accuracy by more than 40\% compared to the original PDR.</p></details> |  |

However, drastic appearance changes of images captured from different viewpoints at the same location pose incoherent supervision signals for descriptor learning, which severely hinder the performance of VPR. Previous work proposes classifying images based on manually defined rules or ground truth labels for viewpoints, followed by descriptor training based on the classification results. However, not all datasets have ground truth labels of viewpoints and manually defined rules may be suboptimal, leading to degraded descriptor performance.To address these challenges, we introduce the mutual learning of viewpoint self-classification and VPR. Starting from coarse classification based on geographical coordinates, we progress to finer classification of viewpoints using simple clustering techniques. The dataset is partitioned in an unsupervised manner while simultaneously training a descriptor extractor for place recognition. Experimental results show that this approach almost perfectly partitions the dataset based on viewpoints, thus achieving mutually reinforcing effects. Our method even excels state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods that partition datasets using ground truth labels.</p></details> | 8 pages |

While the reliability of VPR methods has been extensively studied under conditions such as changes in illumination, season, weather and viewpoint, the impact of motion blur is relatively unexplored despite its relevance not only in rapid motion scenarios but also in low-light conditions where longer exposure times are necessary. Similarly, the role of image deblurring in enhancing VPR performance under motion blur has received limited attention so far. This paper bridges these gaps by introducing a new benchmark designed to evaluate VPR performance under the influence of motion blur and image deblurring. The benchmark includes three datasets that encompass a wide range of motion blur intensities, providing a comprehensive platform for analysis. Experimental results with several well-established VPR and image deblurring methods provide new insights into the effects of motion blur and the potential improvements achieved through deblurring. Building on these findings, the paper proposes adaptive deblurring strategies for VPR, designed to effectively manage motion blur in dynamic, real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Recent breakthroughs in deep learning architectures and training regimes have led to methods with improved robustness to factors like environment appearance change, but with the downside that the required training and/or matching compute scales with the number of distinct environmental conditions encountered. Here, we propose Hyperdimensional One Place Signatures (HOPS) to simultaneously improve the performance, compute and scalability of these state-of-the-art approaches by fusing the descriptors from multiple reference sets captured under different conditions. HOPS scales to any number of environmental conditions by leveraging the Hyperdimensional Computing framework. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our approach is highly generalizable and consistently improves recall performance across all evaluated VPR methods and datasets by large margins. Arbitrarily fusing reference images without compute penalty enables numerous other useful possibilities, three of which we demonstrate here: descriptor dimensionality reduction with no performance penalty, stacking synthetic images, and coarse localization to an entire traverse or environmental section.</p></details> | Under Review |

This paper bridges the gap by providing a comprehensive review of place recognition methods employing LiDAR sensors, thus facilitating and encouraging further research. We commence by delving into the problem formulation of place recognition, exploring existing challenges, and describing relations to previous surveys. Subsequently, we conduct an in-depth review of related research, which offers detailed classifications, strengths and weaknesses, and architectures. Finally, we summarize existing datasets, commonly used evaluation metrics, and comprehensive evaluation results from various methods on public datasets.

Recent studies have begun to explore representations learned in large generative image models for semantic correspondence, demonstrating promising results. Building on this progress, current state-of-the-art methods rely on combining multiple large models, resulting in high computational demands and reduced efficiency. In this work, we address this challenge by proposing a more computationally efficient approach. We propose a novel knowledge distillation technique to overcome the problem of reduced efficiency. We show how to use two large vision foundation models and distill the capabilities of these complementary models into one smaller model that maintains high accuracy at reduced computational cost. Furthermore, we demonstrate that by incorporating 3D data, we are able to further improve performance, without the need for human-annotated correspondences. Overall, our empirical results demonstrate that our distilled model with 3D data augmentation achieves performance superior to current state-of-the-art methods while significantly reducing computational load and enhancing practicality for real-world applications, such as semantic video correspondence.

We propose a novel visual place recognition approach based on overlap prediction, called VOP, shifting from traditional reliance on global image similarities and local features to image overlap prediction. VOP proceeds co-visible image sections by obtaining patch-level embeddings using a Vision Transformer backbone and establishing patch-to-patch correspondences without requiring expensive feature detection and matching. Our approach uses a voting mechanism to assess overlap scores for potential database images. It provides a nuanced image retrieval metric in challenging scenarios. Experimental results show that VOP leads to more accurate relative pose estimation and localization results on the retrieved image pairs than state-of-the-art baselines on a number of large-scale, real-world indoor and outdoor benchmarks.

| **[EDTformer: An Efficient Decoder Transformer for Visual Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00784v1)** | 2024-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual place recognition (VPR) aims to determine the general geographical location of a query image by retrieving visually similar images from a large geo-tagged database. To obtain a global representation for each place image, most approaches typically focus on the aggregation of deep features extracted from a backbone through using current prominent architectures (e.g., CNNs, MLPs, pooling layer and transformer encoder), giving little attention to the transformer decoder. However, we argue that its strong capability in capturing contextual dependencies and generating accurate features holds considerable potential for the VPR task. To this end, we propose an Efficient Decoder Transformer (EDTformer) for feature aggregation, which consists of several stacked simplified decoder blocks followed by two linear layers to directly generate robust and discriminative global representations for VPR. Specifically, we do this by formulating deep features as the keys and values, as well as a set of independent learnable parameters as the queries. EDTformer can fully utilize the contextual information within deep features, then gradually decode and aggregate the effective features into the learnable queries to form the final global representations. Moreover, to provide powerful deep features for EDTformer and further facilitate the robustness, we use the foundation model DINOv2 as the backbone and propose a Low-Rank Parallel Adaptation (LoPA) method to enhance it, which can refine the intermediate features of the backbone progressively in a memory- and parameter-efficient way. As a result, our method not only outperforms single-stage VPR methods on multiple benchmark datasets, but also outperforms two-stage VPR methods which add a re-ranking with considerable cost. Code will be available at https://github.com/Tong-Jin01/EDTformer.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures |

A scene representation is either metric, such as landmark maps in 3D reconstruction, 3D bounding boxes in object detection, or voxel grids in occupancy prediction, or topological, such as pose graphs with loop closures in SLAM or visibility graphs in SfM. In this work, we propose to build Multiview Scene Graphs (MSG) from unposed images, representing a scene topologically with interconnected place and object nodes. The task of building MSG is challenging for existing representation learning methods since it needs to jointly address both visual place recognition, object detection, and object association from images with limited fields of view and potentially large viewpoint changes. To evaluate any method tackling this task, we developed an MSG dataset and annotation based on a public 3D dataset. We also propose an evaluation metric based on the intersection-over-union score of MSG edges. Moreover, we develop a novel baseline method built on mainstream pretrained vision models, combining visual place recognition and object association into one Transformer decoder architecture. Experiments demonstrate that our method has superior performance compared to existing relevant baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024.

However, most of them require a training set with ground truth sensor poses to obtain positive and negative samples of each observation's spatial neighborhood for supervised learning. When such information is unavailable, temporal neighborhoods from a sequentially collected data stream could be exploited for self-supervised training, although we find its performance suboptimal. Inspired by noisy label learning, we propose a novel self-supervised framework named TF-VPR that uses temporal neighborhoods and learnable feature neighborhoods to discover unknown spatial neighborhoods. Our method follows an iterative training paradigm which alternates between: (1) representation learning with data augmentation, (2) positive set expansion to include the current feature space neighbors, and (3) positive set contraction via geometric verification. We conduct auto-labeling and generalization tests on both simulated and real datasets, with either RGB images or point clouds as inputs. The results show that our method outperforms self-supervised baselines in recall rate, robustness, and heading diversity, a novel metric we propose for VPR.

Previously, SVM classifiers have been used to monitor VPR integrity. This research introduces a novel Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) integrity monitor which demonstrates improved performance and generalizability, removing per-environment training and reducing manual tuning requirements. We test our proposed system in extensive real-world experiments, presenting two real-time integrity-based VPR verification methods: a single-query rejection method for robot navigation to a goal zone (Experiment 1); and a history-of-queries method that takes a best, verified, match from its recent trajectory and uses an odometer to extrapolate a current position estimate (Experiment 2). Noteworthy results for Experiment 1 include a decrease in aggregate mean along-track goal error from ~9.8m to ~3.1m, and an increase in the aggregate rate of successful mission completion from ~41% to ~55%. Experiment 2 showed a decrease in aggregate mean along-track localization error from ~2.0m to ~0.5m, and an increase in the aggregate localization precision from ~97% to ~99%. Overall, our results demonstrate the practical usefulness of a VPR integrity monitor in real-world robotics to improve VPR localization and consequent navigation performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Autho...</summary><p>Author Accepted Preprint for Robotics and Automation Letters</p></details> |

In this paper, we introduce a new technique, called Bag-of-Queries (BoQ), which learns a set of global queries designed to capture universal place-specific attributes. Unlike existing methods that employ self-attention and generate the queries directly from the input features, BoQ employs distinct learnable global queries, which probe the input features via cross-attention, ensuring consistent information aggregation. In addition, our technique provides an interpretable attention mechanism and integrates with both CNN and Vision Transformer backbones. The performance of BoQ is demonstrated through extensive experiments on 14 large-scale benchmarks. It consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques including NetVLAD, MixVPR and EigenPlaces. Moreover, as a global retrieval technique (one-stage), BoQ surpasses two-stage retrieval methods, such as Patch-NetVLAD, TransVPR and R2Former, all while being orders of magnitude faster and more efficient.

While Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are the standard default solution for solving the aerial localization problem, it is subject to a number of limitations, such as, signal instability or solution unreliability that make this option not so desirable. Consequently, visual geolocalization is emerging as a viable alternative. However, adapting Visual Place Recognition (VPR) task to aerial imagery presents significant challenges, including weather variations and repetitive patterns. Current VPR reviews largely neglect the specific context of aerial data. This paper introduces a methodology tailored for evaluating VPR techniques specifically in the domain of aerial imagery, providing a comprehensive assessment of various methods and their performance. However, we not only compare various VPR methods, but also demonstrate the importance of selecting appropriate zoom and overlap levels when constructing map tiles to achieve maximum efficiency of VPR algorithms in the case of aerial imagery.

VPR faces challenges such as accurate image neighbor retrieval and appearance change in scenery. Event cameras, also known as dynamic vision sensors, are a new sensor modality for VPR and offer a promising solution to the challenges with their unique attributes: high temporal resolution (1MHz clock), ultra-low latency (in {\mu}s), and high dynamic range (>120dB). These attributes make event cameras less susceptible to motion blur and more robust in variable lighting conditions, making them suitable for addressing VPR challenges. However, the scarcity of event-based VPR datasets, partly due to the novelty and cost of event cameras, hampers their adoption. To fill this data gap, our paper introduces the NYC-Event-VPR dataset to the robotics and computer vision communities, featuring the Prophesee IMX636 HD event sensor (1280x720 resolution), combined with RGB camera and GPS module. It encompasses over 13 hours of geotagged event data, spanning 260 kilometers across New York City, covering diverse lighting and weather conditions, day/night scenarios, and multiple visits to various locations. Furthermore, our paper employs three frameworks to conduct generalization performance assessments, promoting innovation in event-based VPR and its integration into robotics applications.</p></details> |  |

Model-free approaches compute the image pair similarity based on a spatial comparison of corresponding local visual features, eliminating the need for computationally expensive estimation of a model describing transformation between images. The article focuses on model-free re-ranking based on standard local visual features and their applicability in long-term autonomy systems. It introduces three new model-free re-ranking methods that were designed primarily for deep-learned local visual features. These features evince high robustness to various appearance changes, which stands as a crucial property for use with long-term autonomy systems. All the introduced methods were employed in a new visual place recognition system together with the D2-net feature detector (Dusmanu, 2019) and experimentally tested with diverse, challenging public datasets. The obtained results are on par with current state-of-the-art methods, affirming that model-free approaches are a viable and worthwhile path for long-term visual place recognition.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 9 figures, IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles (Early Access)</p></details> |
| **[Context-Based Visual-Language Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19341v1)** | 2024-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In vision-based robot localization and SLAM, Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is essential. This paper addresses the problem of VPR, which involves accurately recognizing the location corresponding to a given query image. A popular approach to vision-based place recognition relies on low-level visual features. Despite significant progress in recent years, place recognition based on low-level visual features is challenging when there are changes in scene appearance. To address this, end-to-end training approaches have been proposed to overcome the limitations of hand-crafted features. However, these approaches still fail under drastic changes and require large amounts of labeled data to train models, presenting a significant limitation. Methods that leverage high-level semantic information, such as objects or categories, have been proposed to handle variations in appearance. In this paper, we introduce a novel VPR approach that remains robust to scene changes and does not require additional training. Our method constructs semantic image descriptors by extracting pixel-level embeddings using a zero-shot, language-driven semantic segmentation model. We validate our approach in challenging place recognition scenarios using real-world public dataset. The experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms non-learned image representation techniques and off-the-shelf convolutional neural network (CNN) descriptors.

| **[Monocular Visual Place Recognition in LiDAR Maps via Cross-Modal State Space Model and Multi-View Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06285v1)** | 2024-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving monocular camera localization within pre-built LiDAR maps can bypass the simultaneous mapping process of visual SLAM systems, potentially reducing the computational overhead of autonomous localization. To this end, one of the key challenges is cross-modal place recognition, which involves retrieving 3D scenes (point clouds) from a LiDAR map according to online RGB images. In this paper, we introduce an efficient framework to learn descriptors for both RGB images and point clouds. It takes visual state space model (VMamba) as the backbone and employs a pixel-view-scene joint training strategy for cross-modal contrastive learning. To address the field-of-view differences, independent descriptors are generated from multiple evenly distributed viewpoints for point clouds. A visible 3D points overlap strategy is then designed to quantify the similarity between point cloud views and RGB images for multi-view supervision. Additionally, when generating descriptors from pixel-level features using NetVLAD, we compensate for the loss of geometric information, and introduce an efficient scheme for multi-view generation. Experimental results on the KITTI and KITTI-360 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our method. The code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[VLAD-BuFF: Burst-aware Fast Feature Aggregation for Visual Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19293v1)** | 2024-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is a crucial component of many visual localization pipelines for embodied agents. VPR is often formulated as an image retrieval task aimed at jointly learning local features and an aggregation method. The current state-of-the-art VPR methods rely on VLAD aggregation, which can be trained to learn a weighted contribution of features through their soft assignment to cluster centers. However, this process has two key limitations. Firstly, the feature-to-cluster weighting does not account for over-represented repetitive structures within a cluster, e.g., shadows or window panes; this phenomenon is also referred to as the `burstiness' problem, classically solved by discounting repetitive features before aggregation. Secondly, feature to cluster comparisons are compute-intensive for state-of-the-art image encoders with high-dimensional local features. This paper addresses these limitations by introducing VLAD-BuFF with two novel contributions: i) a self-similarity based feature discounting mechanism to learn Burst-aware features within end-to-end VPR training, and ii) Fast Feature aggregation by reducing local feature dimensions specifically through PCA-initialized learnable pre-projection. We benchmark our method on 9 public datasets, where VLAD-BuFF sets a new state of the art. Our method is able to maintain its high recall even for 12x reduced local feature dimensions, thus enabling fast feature aggregation without compromising on recall. Through additional qualitative studies, we show how our proposed weighting method effectively downweights the non-distinctive features.

| **[Revisit Anything: Visual Place Recognition via Image Segment Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18049v1)** | 2024-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately recognizing a revisited place is crucial for embodied agents to localize and navigate. This requires visual representations to be distinct, despite strong variations in camera viewpoint and scene appearance. Existing visual place recognition pipelines encode the "whole" image and search for matches. This poses a fundamental challenge in matching two images of the same place captured from different camera viewpoints: "the similarity of what overlaps can be dominated by the dissimilarity of what does not overlap". We address this by encoding and searching for "image segments" instead of the whole images. We propose to use open-set image segmentation to decompose an image into `meaningful' entities (i.e., things and stuff). This enables us to create a novel image representation as a collection of multiple overlapping subgraphs connecting a segment with its neighboring segments, dubbed SuperSegment. Furthermore, to efficiently encode these SuperSegments into compact vector representations, we propose a novel factorized representation of feature aggregation. We show that retrieving these partial representations leads to significantly higher recognition recall than the typical whole image based retrieval. Our segments-based approach, dubbed SegVLAD, sets a new state-of-the-art in place recognition on a diverse selection of benchmark datasets, while being applicable to both generic and task-specialized image encoders. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of our method to ``revisit anything'' by evaluating our method on an object instance retrieval task, which bridges the two disparate areas of research: visual place recognition and object-goal navigation, through their common aim of recognizing goal objects specific to a place.

While learning-based methods have surpassed traditional handcrafted techniques, their training often relies on simplistic homography-based simulations of multi-view perspectives, limiting model generalisability. This paper presents a novel approach leveraging Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) to generate a diverse and realistic dataset consisting of indoor and outdoor scenes. Our proposed methodology adapts state-of-the-art feature detectors and descriptors for training on multi-view NeRF-synthesised data, with supervision achieved through perspective projective geometry. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed methodology achieves competitive or superior performance on standard benchmarks for relative pose estimation, point cloud registration, and homography estimation while requiring significantly less training data and time compared to existing approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Structured Pruning for Efficient Visual Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07834v1)** | 2024-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is fundamental for the global re-localization of robots and devices, enabling them to recognize previously visited locations based on visual inputs. This capability is crucial for maintaining accurate mapping and localization over large areas. Given that VPR methods need to operate in real-time on embedded systems, it is critical to optimize these systems for minimal resource consumption. While the most efficient VPR approaches employ standard convolutional backbones with fixed descriptor dimensions, these often lead to redundancy in the embedding space as well as in the network architecture. Our work introduces a novel structured pruning method, to not only streamline common VPR architectures but also to strategically remove redundancies within the feature embedding space. This dual focus significantly enhances the efficiency of the system, reducing both map and model memory requirements and decreasing feature extraction and retrieval latencies. Our approach has reduced memory usage and latency by 21% and 16%, respectively, across models, while minimally impacting recall@1 accuracy by less than 1%. This significant improvement enhances real-time applications on edge devices with negligible accuracy loss.</p></details> |  |
| **[Matched Filtering based LiDAR Place Recognition for Urban and Natural Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03998v1)** | 2024-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Place recognition is an important task within autonomous navigation, involving the re-identification of previously visited locations from an initial traverse. Unlike visual place recognition (VPR), LiDAR place recognition (LPR) is tolerant to changes in lighting, seasons, and textures, leading to high performance on benchmark datasets from structured urban environments. However, there is a growing need for methods that can operate in diverse environments with high performance and minimal training. In this paper, we propose a handcrafted matching strategy that performs roto-translation invariant place recognition and relative pose estimation for both urban and unstructured natural environments. Our approach constructs Birds Eye View (BEV) global descriptors and employs a two-stage search using matched filtering -- a signal processing technique for detecting known signals amidst noise. Extensive testing on the NCLT, Oxford Radar, and WildPlaces datasets consistently demonstrates state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance across place recognition and relative pose estimation metrics, with up to 15% higher recall than previous SoTA.</p></details> |  |

Visual place recognition, a critical component for navigation, is often hampered by the high resource demands of conventional systems, making them unsuitable for small-scale robotic platforms which still require to perform complex, long-range tasks. Although neuromorphic approaches offer potential for greater efficiency, real-time edge deployment remains constrained by the complexity and limited scalability of bio-realistic networks. Here, we demonstrate a neuromorphic localization system that performs accurate place recognition in up to 8km of traversal using models as small as 180 KB with 44k parameters, while consuming less than 1% of the energy required by conventional methods. Our Locational Encoding with Neuromorphic Systems (LENS) integrates spiking neural networks, an event-based dynamic vision sensor, and a neuromorphic processor within a single SPECK(TM) chip, enabling real-time, energy-efficient localization on a hexapod robot.

| **[Enhancing Visual Place Recognition via Fast and Slow Adaptive Biasing in Event Cameras](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16425v2)** | 2024-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event cameras are increasingly popular in robotics due to beneficial features such as low latency, energy efficiency, and high dynamic range. Nevertheless, their downstream task performance is greatly influenced by the optimization of bias parameters. These parameters, for instance, regulate the necessary change in light intensity to trigger an event, which in turn depends on factors such as the environment lighting and camera motion. This paper introduces feedback control algorithms that automatically tune the bias parameters through two interacting methods: 1) An immediate, on-the-fly \textit{fast} adaptation of the refractory period, which sets the minimum interval between consecutive events, and 2) if the event rate exceeds the specified bounds even after changing the refractory period repeatedly, the controller adapts the pixel bandwidth and event thresholds, which stabilizes after a short period of noise events across all pixels (\textit{slow} adaptation). Our evaluation focuses on the visual place recognition task, where incoming query images are compared to a given reference database. We conducted comprehensive evaluations of our algorithms' adaptive feedback control in real-time. To do so, we collected the QCR-Fast-and-Slow dataset that contains DAVIS346 event camera streams from 366 repeated traversals of a Scout Mini robot navigating through a 100 meter long indoor lab setting (totaling over 35km distance traveled) in varying brightness conditions with ground truth location information. Our proposed feedback controllers result in superior performance when compared to the standard bias settings and prior feedback control methods. Our findings also detail the impact of bias adjustments on task performance and feature ablation studies on the fast and slow adaptation mechanisms.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 9 figures, paper accepted to the 2024 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2024)</p></details> |

While existing work demonstrates the viability of meshes for visual localization, the impact of using synthetic databases rendered from them in visual place recognition remains largely unexplored. In this work we investigate using dense 3D textured meshes for large-scale Visual Place Recognition (VPR). We identify a significant performance drop when using synthetic mesh-based image databases compared to real-world images for retrieval. To address this, we propose MeshVPR, a novel VPR pipeline that utilizes a lightweight features alignment framework to bridge the gap between real-world and synthetic domains. MeshVPR leverages pre-trained VPR models and is efficient and scalable for city-wide deployments. We introduce novel datasets with freely available 3D meshes and manually collected queries from Berlin, Paris, and Melbourne.

The motivation arises from two key observations about place recognition methods based on both appearance and structure: 1) For the methods relying on LiDAR sensors, the integration of LiDAR in robotic systems has led to increased expenses, while the alignment of data between different sensors is also a major challenge. 2) Other image-/camera-based methods, involving integrating RGB images and their derived variants (eg, pseudo depth images, pseudo 3D point clouds), exhibit several limitations, such as the failure to effectively exploit the explicit spatial relationships between different objects. To tackle the above issues, we design a new BEV-enhanced VPR framework, namely BEV$^2$PR, generating a composite descriptor with both visual cues and spatial awareness based on a single camera. The key points lie in: 1) We use BEV features as an explicit source of structural knowledge in constructing global features. 2) The lower layers of the pre-trained backbone from BEV generation are shared for visual and structural streams in VPR, facilitating the learning of fine-grained local features in the visual stream. 3) The complementary visual and structural features can jointly enhance VPR performance. Our BEV$^2$PR framework enables consistent performance improvements over several popular aggregation modules for RGB global features. The experiments on our collected VPR-NuScenes dataset demonstrate an absolute gain of 2.47% on Recall@1 for the strong Conv-AP baseline to achieve the best performance in our setting, and notably, a 18.06% gain on the hard set.

| **[LVLM-empowered Multi-modal Representation Learning for Visual Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06730v1)** | 2024-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual place recognition (VPR) remains challenging due to significant viewpoint changes and appearance variations. Mainstream works tackle these challenges by developing various feature aggregation methods to transform deep features into robust and compact global representations. Unfortunately, satisfactory results cannot be achieved under challenging conditions. We start from a new perspective and attempt to build a discriminative global representations by fusing image data and text descriptions of the the visual scene. The motivation is twofold: (1) Current Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate extraordinary emergent capability in visual instruction following, and thus provide an efficient and flexible manner in generating text descriptions of images; (2) The text descriptions, which provide high-level scene understanding, show strong robustness against environment variations. Although promising, leveraging LVLMs to build multi-modal VPR solutions remains challenging in efficient multi-modal fusion. Furthermore, LVLMs will inevitably produces some inaccurate descriptions, making it even harder. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel multi-modal VPR solution. It first adapts pre-trained visual and language foundation models to VPR for extracting image and text features, which are then fed into the feature combiner to enhance each other. As the main component, the feature combiner first propose a token-wise attention block to adaptively recalibrate text tokens according to their relevance to the image data, and then develop an efficient cross-attention fusion module to propagate information across different modalities. The enhanced multi-modal features are compressed into the feature descriptor for performing retrieval. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin with significantly smaller image descriptor dimension.</p></details> |  |
| **[Close, But Not There: Boosting Geographic Distance Sensitivity in Visual Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02422v1)** | 2024-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Place Recognition (VPR) plays a critical role in many localization and mapping pipelines. It consists of retrieving the closest sample to a query image, in a certain embedding space, from a database of geotagged references. The image embedding is learned to effectively describe a place despite variations in visual appearance, viewpoint, and geometric changes. In this work, we formulate how limitations in the Geographic Distance Sensitivity of current VPR embeddings result in a high probability of incorrectly sorting the top-k retrievals, negatively impacting the recall. In order to address this issue in single-stage VPR, we propose a novel mining strategy, CliqueMining, that selects positive and negative examples by sampling cliques from a graph of visually similar images. Our approach boosts the sensitivity of VPR embeddings at small distance ranges, significantly improving the state of the art on relevant benchmarks. In particular, we raise recall@1 from 75% to 82% in MSLS Challenge, and from 76% to 90% in Nordland. Models and code are available at https://github.com/serizba/cliquemining.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamically Modulating Visual Place Recognition Sequence Length For Minimum Acceptable Performance Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00863v1)** | 2024-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mobile robots and autonomous vehicles are often required to function in environments where critical position estimates from sensors such as GPS become uncertain or unreliable. Single image visual place recognition (VPR) provides an alternative for localization but often requires techniques such as sequence matching to improve robustness, which incurs additional computation and latency costs. Even then, the sequence length required to localize at an acceptable performance level varies widely; and simply setting overly long fixed sequence lengths creates unnecessary latency, computational overhead, and can even degrade performance. In these scenarios it is often more desirable to meet or exceed a set target performance at minimal expense. In this paper we present an approach which uses a calibration set of data to fit a model that modulates sequence length for VPR as needed to exceed a target localization performance. We make use of a coarse position prior, which could be provided by any other localization system, and capture the variation in appearance across this region. We use the correlation between appearance variation and sequence length to curate VPR features and fit a multilayer perceptron (MLP) for selecting the optimal length. We demonstrate that this method is effective at modulating sequence length to maximize the number of sections in a dataset which meet or exceed a target performance whilst minimizing the median length used. We show applicability across several datasets and reveal key phenomena like generalization capabilities, the benefits of curating features and the utility of non-state-of-the-art feature extractors with nuanced properties.</p></details> | DOI TBC |
| **[Optimal Transport Aggregation for Visual Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15937v2)** | 2024-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The task of Visual Place Recognition (VPR) aims to match a query image against references from an extensive database of images from different places, relying solely on visual cues. State-of-the-art pipelines focus on the aggregation of features extracted from a deep backbone, in order to form a global descriptor for each image. In this context, we introduce SALAD (Sinkhorn Algorithm for Locally Aggregated Descriptors), which reformulates NetVLAD's soft-assignment of local features to clusters as an optimal transport problem. In SALAD, we consider both feature-to-cluster and cluster-to-feature relations and we also introduce a 'dustbin' cluster, designed to selectively discard features deemed non-informative, enhancing the overall descriptor quality. Additionally, we leverage and fine-tune DINOv2 as a backbone, which provides enhanced description power for the local features, and dramatically reduces the required training time. As a result, our single-stage method not only surpasses single-stage baselines in public VPR datasets, but also surpasses two-stage methods that add a re-ranking with significantly higher cost.

However, their performance in place recognition is still underexplored. In this work, we introduce multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) to visual place recognition (VPR), where a robot must localize itself using visual observations. Our key design is to use vision-based retrieval to propose several candidates and then leverage language-based reasoning to carefully inspect each candidate for a final decision. Specifically, we leverage the robust visual features produced by off-the-shelf vision foundation models (VFMs) to obtain several candidate locations. We then prompt an MLLM to describe the differences between the current observation and each candidate in a pairwise manner, and reason about the best candidate based on these descriptions. Our results on three datasets demonstrate that integrating the general-purpose visual features from VFMs with the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs already provides an effective place recognition solution, without any VPR-specific supervised training. We believe our work can inspire new possibilities for applying and designing foundation models, i.e., VFMs, LLMs, and MLLMs, to enhance the localization and navigation of mobile robots.</p></details> |  |

Contemporary methods in visual place recognition employ convolutional neural networks and utilize every region within the image for the place recognition task. However, the presence of dynamic and distracting elements in the image may impact the effectiveness of the place recognition process. Therefore, it is meaningful to focus on task-relevant regions of the image for improved recognition. In this paper, we present PlaceFormer, a novel transformer-based approach for visual place recognition. PlaceFormer employs patch tokens from the transformer to create global image descriptors, which are then used for image retrieval. To re-rank the retrieved images, PlaceFormer merges the patch tokens from the transformer to form multi-scale patches. Utilizing the transformer's self-attention mechanism, it selects patches that correspond to task-relevant areas in an image. These selected patches undergo geometric verification, generating similarity scores across different patch sizes. Subsequently, spatial scores from each patch size are fused to produce a final similarity score. This score is then used to re-rank the images initially retrieved using global image descriptors. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that PlaceFormer outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency, requiring less time and memory.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Robotics and Automation Letters</p></details> |

Due to the significant changes in appearance caused by season, lighting, and time spans between query images and database images for retrieval, these differences increase the difficulty of place recognition. Previous methods often discarded useless features (such as sky, road, vehicles) while uncontrolled discarding features that help improve recognition accuracy (such as buildings, trees). To preserve these useful features, we propose a new feature aggregation method to address this issue. Specifically, in order to obtain global and local features that contain discriminative place information, we added some registers on top of the original image tokens to assist in model training. After reallocating attention weights, these registers were discarded. The experimental results show that these registers surprisingly separate unstable features from the original image representation and outperform state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

VPR uses a database of geo-tagged images and leverages deep neural networks to extract a global representation, called descriptor, from each image. While the training data for VPR models often originates from diverse, geographically scattered sources (geo-tagged images), the training process itself is typically assumed to be centralized. This research revisits the task of VPR through the lens of Federated Learning (FL), addressing several key challenges associated with this adaptation. VPR data inherently lacks well-defined classes, and models are typically trained using contrastive learning, which necessitates a data mining step on a centralized database. Additionally, client devices in federated systems can be highly heterogeneous in terms of their processing capabilities. The proposed FedVPR framework not only presents a novel approach for VPR but also introduces a new, challenging, and realistic task for FL research, paving the way to other image retrieval tasks in FL.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 7 figures, CVPR - The 3rd International Workshop on Federated Learning for Computer Vision (FedVision-2024)</p></details> |

However, the analogous robotics capability, visual place recognition (VPR) with limited field of view cameras under 180 degree rotations, has proven to be challenging to achieve. To address this problem, this paper presents Same Place Opposing Trajectory (SPOT), a technique for opposing viewpoint VPR that relies exclusively on structure estimated through stereo visual odometry (VO). The method extends recent advances in lidar descriptors and utilizes a novel double (similar and opposing) distance matrix sequence matching method. We evaluate SPOT on a publicly available dataset with 6.7-7.6 km routes driven in similar and opposing directions under various lighting conditions. The proposed algorithm demonstrates remarkable improvement over the state-of-the-art, achieving up to 91.7% recall at 100% precision in opposing viewpoint cases, while requiring less storage than all baselines tested and running faster than all but one. Moreover, the proposed method assumes no a priori knowledge of whether the viewpoint is similar or opposing, and also demonstrates competitive performance in similar viewpoint cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICRA 2024, project website: https://umautobots.github.io/spot</p></details> |

Thanks to the practical feature extraction ability of the lightweight convolution neural networks (CNNs) and the train-ability of the vector of locally aggregated descriptors (VLAD) layer, we propose a lightweight weakly supervised end-to-end neural network consisting of a front-ended perception model called GhostCNN and a learnable VLAD layer as a back-end. GhostCNN is based on Ghost modules that are lightweight CNN-based architectures. They can generate redundant feature maps using linear operations instead of the traditional convolution process, making a good trade-off between computation resources and recognition accuracy. To enhance our proposed lightweight model further, we add dilated convolutions to the Ghost module to get features containing more spatial semantic information, improving accuracy. Finally, rich experiments conducted on a commonly used public benchmark and our private dataset validate that the proposed neural network reduces the FLOPs and parameters of VGG16-NetVLAD by 99.04% and 80.16%, respectively. Besides, both models achieve similar accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Seamless Adaptation of Pre-trained Models for Visual Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14505v3)** | 2024-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies show that vision models pre-trained in generic visual learning tasks with large-scale data can provide useful feature representations for a wide range of visual perception problems. However, few attempts have been made to exploit pre-trained foundation models in visual place recognition (VPR). Due to the inherent difference in training objectives and data between the tasks of model pre-training and VPR, how to bridge the gap and fully unleash the capability of pre-trained models for VPR is still a key issue to address. To this end, we propose a novel method to realize seamless adaptation of pre-trained models for VPR. Specifically, to obtain both global and local features that focus on salient landmarks for discriminating places, we design a hybrid adaptation method to achieve both global and local adaptation efficiently, in which only lightweight adapters are tuned without adjusting the pre-trained model. Besides, to guide effective adaptation, we propose a mutual nearest neighbor local feature loss, which ensures proper dense local features are produced for local matching and avoids time-consuming spatial verification in re-ranking. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with less training data and training time, and uses about only 3% retrieval runtime of the two-stage VPR methods with RANSAC-based spatial verification. It ranks 1st on the MSLS challenge leaderboard (at the time of submission). The code is released at https://github.com/Lu-Feng/SelaVPR.</p></details> | ICLR2024 |

These networks typically produce a global representation of a place image using only this image itself and neglect the cross-image variations (e.g. viewpoint and illumination), which limits their robustness in challenging scenes. In this paper, we propose a robust global representation method with cross-image correlation awareness for VPR, named CricaVPR. Our method uses the attention mechanism to correlate multiple images within a batch. These images can be taken in the same place with different conditions or viewpoints, or even captured from different places. Therefore, our method can utilize the cross-image variations as a cue to guide the representation learning, which ensures more robust features are produced. To further facilitate the robustness, we propose a multi-scale convolution-enhanced adaptation method to adapt pre-trained visual foundation models to the VPR task, which introduces the multi-scale local information to further enhance the cross-image correlation-aware representation. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin with significantly less training time.

| **[On the Estimation of Image-matching Uncertainty in Visual Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00546v1)** | 2024-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Visual Place Recognition (VPR) the pose of a query image is estimated by comparing the image to a map of reference images with known reference poses. As is typical for image retrieval problems, a feature extractor maps the query and reference images to a feature space, where a nearest neighbor search is then performed. However, till recently little attention has been given to quantifying the confidence that a retrieved reference image is a correct match. Highly certain but incorrect retrieval can lead to catastrophic failure of VPR-based localization pipelines. This work compares for the first time the main approaches for estimating the image-matching uncertainty, including the traditional retrieval-based uncertainty estimation, more recent data-driven aleatoric uncertainty estimation, and the compute-intensive geometric verification. We further formulate a simple baseline method, ``SUE'', which unlike the other methods considers the freely-available poses of the reference images in the map. Our experiments reveal that a simple L2-distance between the query and reference descriptors is already a better estimate of image-matching uncertainty than current data-driven approaches. SUE outperforms the other efficient uncertainty estimation methods, and its uncertainty estimates complement the computationally expensive geometric verification approach. Future works for uncertainty estimation in VPR should consider the baselines discussed in this work.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in the proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) 2024</p></details> |

It is challenging due to appearance changes at various frequencies, and difficulties of obtaining ground truth metric trajectories for training and evaluation. This paper introduces the NYC-Indoor-VPR dataset, a unique and rich collection of over 36,000 images compiled from 13 distinct crowded scenes in New York City taken under varying lighting conditions with appearance changes. Each scene has multiple revisits across a year. To establish the ground truth for VPR, we propose a semiautomatic annotation approach that computes the positional information of each image. Our method specifically takes pairs of videos as input and yields matched pairs of images along with their estimated relative locations. The accuracy of this matching is refined by human annotators, who utilize our annotation software to correlate the selected keyframes. Finally, we present a benchmark evaluation of several state-of-the-art VPR algorithms using our annotated dataset, revealing its challenge and thus value for VPR research.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 7 figures, published in 2024 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA 2024)</p></details> |

Since typically a mobile robot has access to a continuous stream of frames, this task is naturally cast as a sequence-to-sequence localization problem. Nevertheless, obtaining sequences of labelled data is much more expensive than collecting isolated images, which can be done in an automated way with little supervision. As a mitigation to this problem, we propose a novel Joint Image and Sequence Training protocol (JIST) that leverages large uncurated sets of images through a multi-task learning framework. With JIST we also introduce SeqGeM, an aggregation layer that revisits the popular GeM pooling to produce a single robust and compact embedding from a sequence of single-frame embeddings. We show that our model is able to outperform previous state of the art while being faster, using 8 times smaller descriptors, having a lighter architecture and allowing to process sequences of various lengths.

However, like many vision tasks, VPR always degrades at night due to the scarcity of nighttime images. Moreover, VPR needs to address the cross-domain problem of night-to-day rather than just the issue of a single nighttime domain. In response to these issues, we present NocPlace, which leverages generative and inherited knowledge transfer to embed resilience against dazzling lights and extreme darkness in the global descriptor. First, we establish a day-night urban scene dataset called NightCities, capturing diverse lighting variations and dark scenarios across 60 cities globally. Then, an image generation network is trained on this dataset and processes a large-scale VPR dataset, obtaining its nighttime version. Finally, VPR models are fine-tuned using descriptors inherited from themselves and night-style images, which builds explicit cross-domain contrastive relationships. Comprehensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate our contributions and the superiority of NocPlace. Without adding any real-time computing resources, NocPlace improves the performance of Eigenplaces by 7.6% on Tokyo 24/7 Night and 16.8% on SVOX Night.</p></details> | 28 pages,9 figures |
| **[Deep Homography Estimation for Visual Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16086v2)** | 2024-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual place recognition (VPR) is a fundamental task for many applications such as robot localization and augmented reality. Recently, the hierarchical VPR methods have received considerable attention due to the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. They usually first use global features to retrieve the candidate images, then verify the spatial consistency of matched local features for re-ranking. However, the latter typically relies on the RANSAC algorithm for fitting homography, which is time-consuming and non-differentiable. This makes existing methods compromise to train the network only in global feature extraction. Here, we propose a transformer-based deep homography estimation (DHE) network that takes the dense feature map extracted by a backbone network as input and fits homography for fast and learnable geometric verification. Moreover, we design a re-projection error of inliers loss to train the DHE network without additional homography labels, which can also be jointly trained with the backbone network to help it extract the features that are more suitable for local matching. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method can outperform several state-of-the-art methods. And it is more than one order of magnitude faster than the mainstream hierarchical VPR methods using RANSAC.

Further, a well-balanced combination of data-based and training-free approaches can decrease the required amount of training data and effort and can reduce the influence of distribution shifts between the training and application phases. This paper proposes a runtime and data-efficient hierarchical VPR pipeline that extends existing approaches and presents novel ideas. There are three main contributions: First, we propose Local Positional Graphs (LPG), a training-free and runtime-efficient approach to encode spatial context information of local image features. LPG can be combined with existing local feature detectors and descriptors and considerably improves the image-matching quality compared to existing techniques in our experiments. Second, we present Attentive Local SPED (ATLAS), an extension of our previous local features approach with an attention module that improves the feature quality while maintaining high data efficiency. The influence of the proposed modifications is evaluated in an extensive ablation study. Third, we present a hierarchical pipeline that exploits hyperdimensional computing to use the same local features as holistic HDC-descriptors for fast candidate selection and for candidate reranking. We combine all contributions in a runtime and data-efficient VPR pipeline that shows benefits over the state-of-the-art method Patch-NetVLAD on a large collection of standard place recognition datasets with 15$\%$ better performance in VPR accuracy, 54$\times$ faster feature comparison speed, and 55$\times$ less descriptor storage occupancy, making our method promising for real-world high-performance large-scale VPR in changing environments.

Two parallel lines of work on VPR have shown, on one side, that general-purpose off-the-shelf feature representations can provide robustness to domain shifts, and, on the other, that fused information from sequences of images improves performance. In our recent work on measuring domain gaps between image datasets, we proposed a Visual Distribution of Neuron Activations (VDNA) representation to represent datasets of images. This representation can naturally handle image sequences and provides a general and granular feature representation derived from a general-purpose model. Moreover, our representation is based on tracking neuron activation values over the list of images to represent and is not limited to a particular neural network layer, therefore having access to high- and low-level concepts. This work shows how VDNAs can be used for VPR by learning a very lightweight and simple encoder to generate task-specific descriptors. Our experiments show that our representation can allow for better robustness than current solutions to serious domain shifts away from the training data distribution, such as to indoor environments and aerial imagery.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICRA 2024</p></details> |

Ideas like multi-process fusion, Fly-Inspired Voting Units, SwitchHit or Switch-Fuse involve combining different VPR techniques together, utilizing different strategies. However, a major aspect often common to many of these strategies is voting. Voting is an extremely relevant topic to explore in terms of its application and significance for any ensemble VPR setup. This paper analyses several voting schemes to maximise the place detection accuracy of a VPR ensemble set up and determine the optimal voting schemes for selection. We take inspiration from a variety of voting schemes that are widely employed in fields such as politics and sociology and it is evident via empirical data that the selection of the voting method influences the results drastically. The paper tests a wide variety of voting schemes to present the improvement in the VPR results for several data sets. We aim to determine whether a single optimal voting scheme exists or, much like in other fields of research, the selection of a voting technique is relative to its application and environment. We propose a ranking of these different voting methods from best to worst which allows for better selection. While presenting our results in terms of voting method's performance bounds, in form of radar charts, PR curves to showcase the difference in performance and a comparison methodology using a McNemar test variant to determine the statistical significance of the differences.

While these capabilities are well suited for robotics tasks, SNNs have seen limited adaptation in this field thus far. This work introduces a SNN for Visual Place Recognition (VPR) that is both trainable within minutes and queryable in milliseconds, making it well suited for deployment on compute-constrained robotic systems. Our proposed system, VPRTempo, overcomes slow training and inference times using an abstracted SNN that trades biological realism for efficiency. VPRTempo employs a temporal code that determines the timing of a single spike based on a pixel's intensity, as opposed to prior SNNs relying on rate coding that determined the number of spikes; improving spike efficiency by over 100%. VPRTempo is trained using Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity and a supervised delta learning rule enforcing that each output spiking neuron responds to just a single place. We evaluate our system on the Nordland and Oxford RobotCar benchmark localization datasets, which include up to 27k places. We found that VPRTempo's accuracy is comparable to prior SNNs and the popular NetVLAD place recognition algorithm, while being several orders of magnitude faster and suitable for real-time deployment -- with inference speeds over 50 Hz on CPU. VPRTempo could be integrated as a loop closure component for online SLAM on resource-constrained systems such as space and underwater robots.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, accepted to the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) 2024</p></details> |

In this work, we present PlaceNav, subdividing the robot-independent part into navigation-specific and generic computer vision components. We utilize visual place recognition for the subgoal selection of the topological navigation pipeline. This makes subgoal selection more efficient and enables leveraging large-scale datasets from non-robotics sources, increasing training data availability. Bayesian filtering, enabled by place recognition, further improves navigation performance by increasing the temporal consistency of subgoals. Our experimental results verify the design and the new method obtains a 76% higher success rate in indoor and 23% higher in outdoor navigation tasks with higher computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICRA2...</summary><p>ICRA2024 camera ready</p></details> |

However, the city-scale Lidar maps generally need to be compressed for storage efficiency, which increases the difficulty of direct visual place recognition in compressed Lidar maps. This paper proposes VOLoc, an accurate and efficient visual place recognition method that exploits geometric similarity to directly query the compressed Lidar map via the real-time captured image sequence. In the offline phase, VOLoc compresses the Lidar maps using a \emph{Geometry-Preserving Compressor} (GPC), in which the compression is reversible, a crucial requirement for the downstream 6DoF pose estimation. In the online phase, VOLoc proposes an online Geometric Recovery Module (GRM), which is composed of online Visual Odometry (VO) and a point cloud optimization module, such that the local scene structure around the camera is online recovered to build the \emph{Querying Point Cloud} (QPC). Then the QPC is compressed by the same GPC, and is aggregated into a global descriptor by an attention-based aggregation module, to query the compressed Lidar map in the vector space. A transfer learning mechanism is also proposed to improve the accuracy and the generality of the aggregation network. Extensive evaluations show that VOLoc provides localization accuracy even better than the Lidar-to-Lidar place recognition, setting up a new record for utilizing the compressed Lidar map by low-end mobile cameras.

However, previously proposed deep ANN architectures are often unable to harness the abundant temporal information presented in event streams. In contrast, deep spiking networks exhibit more intricate spatiotemporal dynamics and are inherently well-suited to process sparse asynchronous event streams. Unfortunately, directly inputting temporal-dense event volumes into the spiking network introduces excessive time steps, resulting in prohibitively high training costs for large-scale VPR tasks. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a novel deep spiking network architecture called Spike-EVPR for event-based VPR tasks. First, we introduce two novel event representations tailored for SNN to fully exploit the spatio-temporal information from the event streams, and reduce the video memory occupation during training as much as possible. Then, to exploit the full potential of these two representations, we construct a Bifurcated Spike Residual Encoder (BSR-Encoder) with powerful representational capabilities to better extract the high-level features from the two event representations. Next, we introduce a Shared & Specific Descriptor Extractor (SSD-Extractor). This module is designed to extract features shared between the two representations and features specific to each. Finally, we propose a Cross-Descriptor Aggregation Module (CDA-Module) that fuses the above three features to generate a refined, robust global descriptor of the scene. Our experimental results indicate the superior performance of our Spike-EVPR compared to several existing EVPR pipelines on Brisbane-Event-VPR and DDD20 datasets, with the average Recall@1 increased by 7.61% on Brisbane and 13.20% on DDD20.</p></details> | 14 pages, 10 figures |

However, this approach struggles to ensure accurate distance-based image similarity representation, particularly when training with binary pairwise labels, and complex re-ranking strategies are required. This work introduces a fresh perspective by framing place recognition as a regression problem, using camera field-of-view overlap as similarity ground truth for learning. By optimizing image descriptors to align directly with graded similarity labels, this approach enhances ranking capabilities without expensive re-ranking, offering data-efficient training and strong generalization across several benchmark datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in ICRA 2024</p></details> |

To improve the robustness of VPR in perceptually aliasing scenarios, sequence-based VPR methods are proposed. These methods are either based on matching between frame sequences or extracting sequence descriptors for direct retrieval. However, the former is usually based on the assumption of constant velocity, which is difficult to hold in practice, and is computationally expensive and subject to sequence length. Although the latter overcomes these problems, existing sequence descriptors are constructed by aggregating features of multiple frames only, without interaction on temporal information, and thus cannot obtain descriptors with spatio-temporal discrimination.In this paper, we propose a sequence descriptor that effectively incorporates spatio-temporal information. Specifically, spatial attention within the same frame is utilized to learn spatial feature patterns, while attention in corresponding local regions of different frames is utilized to learn the persistence or change of features over time. We use a sliding window to control the temporal range of attention and use relative positional encoding to construct sequential relationships between different features. This allows our descriptors to capture the intrinsic dynamics in a sequence of frames.Comprehensive experiments on challenging benchmark datasets show that the proposed approach outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods.The code is available at https://github.com/tiev-tongji/Spatio-Temporal-SeqVPR.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, published to RA-L</p></details> |

The proposed approach is formulated as a minimization problem in terms of dominating set algorithm for graph, constructed from spatial information, and referred as DominatingSet. Our algorithm shows better scene coverage in comparison to other methodologies that are used for database creation. Also, we demonstrate that using DominatingSet, a database size could be up to 250-1400 times smaller than the original scanning sequence while maintaining a recall rate of more than 80% on testing sequences. We evaluated our algorithm on 7-scenes and BundleFusion datasets and an additionally recorded sequence in a highly repetitive office setting. In addition, the database selection can produce weakly-supervised labels for fine-tuning neural place recognition algorithms to particular settings, improving even more their accuracy.

| **[Multi-Technique Sequential Information Consistency For Dynamic Visual Place Recognition In Changing Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08263v1)** | 2024-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual place recognition (VPR) is an essential component of robot navigation and localization systems that allows them to identify a place using only image data. VPR is challenging due to the significant changes in a place's appearance driven by different daily illumination, seasonal weather variations and diverse viewpoints. Currently, no single VPR technique excels in every environmental condition, each exhibiting unique benefits and shortcomings, and therefore combining multiple techniques can achieve more reliable VPR performance. Present multi-method approaches either rely on online ground-truth information, which is often not available, or on brute-force technique combination, potentially lowering performance with high variance technique sets. Addressing these shortcomings, we propose a VPR system dubbed Multi-Sequential Information Consistency (MuSIC) which leverages sequential information to select the most cohesive technique on an online per-frame basis. For each technique in a set, MuSIC computes their respective sequential consistencies by analysing the frame-to-frame continuity of their top match candidates, which are then directly compared to select the optimal technique for the current query image. The use of sequential information to select between VPR methods results in an overall VPR performance increase across different benchmark datasets, while avoiding the need for extra ground-truth of the runtime environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2303.14247</p></details> |

While state-of-the-art approaches are trained in a supervised manner and therefore hardly capture the information needed for generalizing to unusual conditions, we argue that self-supervised learning may help abstracting the place representation so that it can be foreseen, irrespective of the conditions. More precisely, in this paper, we investigate learning features that are robust to appearance modifications while sensitive to geometric transformations in a self-supervised manner. This dual-purpose training is made possible by combining the two self-supervision main paradigms, \textit{i.e.} contrastive and predictive learning. Our results on standard benchmarks reveal that jointly learning such appearance-robust and geometry-sensitive image descriptors leads to competitive visual place recognition results across adverse seasonal and illumination conditions, without requiring any human-annotated labels.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 figures, WACV 2024</p></details> |

While VPR techniques built upon a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) backbone dominate state-of-the-art VPR performance, their high computational requirements make them unsuitable for platforms equipped with low-end hardware. Recently, a lightweight VPR system based on multiple bio-inspired classifiers, dubbed DrosoNets, has been proposed, achieving great computational efficiency at the cost of reduced absolute place retrieval performance. In this work, we propose a novel multi-DrosoNet localization system, dubbed RegionDrosoNet, with significantly improved VPR performance, while preserving a low-computational profile. Our approach relies on specializing distinct groups of DrosoNets on differently sliced partitions of the original image, increasing extrinsic model differentiation. Furthermore, we introduce a novel voting module to combine the outputs of all DrosoNets into the final place prediction which considers multiple top refence candidates from each DrosoNet. RegionDrosoNet outperforms other lightweight VPR techniques when dealing with both appearance changes and viewpoint variations. Moreover, it competes with computationally expensive methods on some benchmark datasets at a small fraction of their online inference time.</p></details> |  |

Nonetheless, integrating additional sensors comes with elevated costs and may not be feasible for systems that demand lightweight operation, thereby impacting the practical deployment of VPR. To address this issue, we resort to knowledge distillation, which empowers single-modal students to learn from cross-modal teachers without introducing additional sensors during inference. Despite the notable advancements achieved by current distillation approaches, the exploration of feature relationships remains an under-explored area. In order to tackle the challenge of cross-modal distillation in VPR, we present DistilVPR, a novel distillation pipeline for VPR. We propose leveraging feature relationships from multiple agents, including self-agents and cross-agents for teacher and student neural networks. Furthermore, we integrate various manifolds, characterized by different space curvatures for exploring feature relationships. This approach enhances the diversity of feature relationships, including Euclidean, spherical, and hyperbolic relationship modules, thereby enhancing the overall representational capacity. The experiments demonstrate that our proposed pipeline achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other distillation baselines. We also conduct necessary ablation studies to show design effectiveness.

It requires the ability to accurately recognize a previously visited location under variations such as illumination, occlusion, appearance and viewpoint. In the case of robotic systems and augmented reality, the target devices for deployment are battery powered edge devices. Therefore whilst the accuracy of VPR methods is important so too is memory consumption and latency. Recently new works have focused on the recall@1 metric as a performance measure with limited focus on resource utilization. This has resulted in methods that use deep learning models too large to deploy on low powered edge devices. We hypothesize that these large models are highly over-parameterized and can be optimized to satisfy the constraints of a low powered embedded system whilst maintaining high recall performance. Our work studies the impact of compact convolutional network architecture design in combination with full-precision and mixed-precision post-training quantization on VPR performance. Importantly we not only measure performance via the recall@1 score but also measure memory consumption and latency. We characterize the design implications on memory, latency and recall scores and provide a number of design recommendations for VPR systems under these resource limitations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Divide&Classify: Fine-Grained Classification for City-Wide Visual Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08417v2)** | 2023-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Place recognition is commonly addressed as an image retrieval problem. However, retrieval methods are impractical to scale to large datasets, densely sampled from city-wide maps, since their dimension impact negatively on the inference time. Using approximate nearest neighbour search for retrieval helps to mitigate this issue, at the cost of a performance drop. In this paper we investigate whether we can effectively approach this task as a classification problem, thus bypassing the need for a similarity search. We find that existing classification methods for coarse, planet-wide localization are not suitable for the fine-grained and city-wide setting. This is largely due to how the dataset is split into classes, because these methods are designed to handle a sparse distribution of photos and as such do not consider the visual aliasing problem across neighbouring classes that naturally arises in dense scenarios. Thus, we propose a partitioning scheme that enables a fast and accurate inference, preserving a simple learning procedure, and a novel inference pipeline based on an ensemble of novel classifiers that uses the prototypes learned via an angular margin loss. Our method, Divide&Classify (D&C), enjoys the fast inference of classification solutions and an accuracy competitive with retrieval methods on the fine-grained, city-wide setting. Moreover, we show that D&C can be paired with existing retrieval pipelines to speed up computations by over 20 times while increasing their recall, leading to new state-of-the-art results.</p></details> | Accepted to ICCV23 |

Although most current VPR methods achieve favorable results under ideal conditions, their performance in complex environments, characterized by lighting variations, seasonal changes, and occlusions caused by moving objects, is generally unsatisfactory. In this study, we utilize the DINOv2 model as the backbone network for trimming and fine-tuning to extract robust image features. We propose a novel VPR architecture called DINO-Mix, which combines a foundational vision model with feature aggregation. This architecture relies on the powerful image feature extraction capabilities of foundational vision models. We employ an MLP-Mixer-based mix module to aggregate image features, resulting in globally robust and generalizable descriptors that enable high-precision VPR. We experimentally demonstrate that the proposed DINO-Mix architecture significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. In test sets having lighting variations, seasonal changes, and occlusions (Tokyo24/7, Nordland, SF-XL-Testv1), our proposed DINO-Mix architecture achieved Top-1 accuracy rates of 91.75%, 80.18%, and 82%, respectively. Compared with SOTA methods, our architecture exhibited an average accuracy improvement of 5.14%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review / Open source code</p></details> |

To date, the most performant VPR approaches are environment- and task-specific: while they exhibit strong performance in structured environments (predominantly urban driving), their performance degrades severely in unstructured environments, rendering most approaches brittle to robust real-world deployment. In this work, we develop a universal solution to VPR -- a technique that works across a broad range of structured and unstructured environments (urban, outdoors, indoors, aerial, underwater, and subterranean environments) without any re-training or fine-tuning. We demonstrate that general-purpose feature representations derived from off-the-shelf self-supervised models with no VPR-specific training are the right substrate upon which to build such a universal VPR solution. Combining these derived features with unsupervised feature aggregation enables our suite of methods, AnyLoc, to achieve up to 4X significantly higher performance than existing approaches. We further obtain a 6% improvement in performance by characterizing the semantic properties of these features, uncovering unique domains which encapsulate datasets from similar environments. Our detailed experiments and analysis lay a foundation for building VPR solutions that may be deployed anywhere, anytime, and across anyview.

It aims to summarize a long video walkthrough of a scene into a small set of frames that are spatially diverse in the scene, which has many impotant applications, such as in surveillance, real estate, and robotics. It stems from video summarization but focuses on long and continuous videos from moving cameras, instead of user-edited fragmented video clips that are more commonly studied in existing video summarization works. Our solution to this task is a two-stage self-supervised pipeline named SceneSum. Its first stage uses clustering to segment the video sequence. Our key idea is to combine visual place recognition (VPR) into this clustering process to promote spatial diversity. Its second stage needs to select a representative keyframe from each cluster as the summary while respecting resource constraints such as memory and disk space limits. Additionally, if the ground truth image trajectory is available, our method can be easily augmented with a supervised loss to enhance the clustering and keyframe selection. Extensive experiments on both real-world and simulated datasets show our method outperforms common video summarization baselines by 50%</p></details> |  |
| **[Similarity Min-Max: Zero-Shot Day-Night Domain Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08779v3)** | 2023-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-light conditions not only hamper human visual experience but also degrade the model's performance on downstream vision tasks. While existing works make remarkable progress on day-night domain adaptation, they rely heavily on domain knowledge derived from the task-specific nighttime dataset. This paper challenges a more complicated scenario with border applicability, i.e., zero-shot day-night domain adaptation, which eliminates reliance on any nighttime data. Unlike prior zero-shot adaptation approaches emphasizing either image-level translation or model-level adaptation, we propose a similarity min-max paradigm that considers them under a unified framework. On the image level, we darken images towards minimum feature similarity to enlarge the domain gap. Then on the model level, we maximize the feature similarity between the darkened images and their normal-light counterparts for better model adaptation. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the pioneering effort in jointly optimizing both aspects, resulting in a significant improvement of model generalizability. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method's effectiveness and broad applicability on various nighttime vision tasks, including classification, semantic segmentation, visual place recognition, and video action recognition.

Current methods either rely heavily on GNSS, face limitations in visual-based localization due to appearance variances and stylistic dissimilarities between camera and reference imagery, or operate under the assumption of a known initial pose. In this paper, we developed a GNSS-denied localization approach for UAVs that harnesses both Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) and Visual Place Recognition (VPR) using a foundation model. This paper presents a novel vision-based pipeline that works exclusively with a nadir-facing camera, an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), and pre-existing satellite imagery for robust, accurate localization in varied environments and conditions. Our system demonstrated average localization accuracy within a $20$-meter range, with a minimum error below $1$ meter, under real-world conditions marked by drastic changes in environmental appearance and with no assumption of the vehicle's initial pose. The method is proven to be effective and robust, addressing the crucial need for reliable UAV localization in GNSS-denied environments, while also being computationally efficient enough to be deployed on resource-constrained platforms.</p></details> |  |

Recently, an approach for synthesizing database images from unseen viewpoints using NeRF (Neural Radiance Fields) technology has emerged with impressive performance. However, synthesized images provided by these techniques are often of lower quality than the original images, and furthermore they significantly increase the storage cost of the database. In this study, we explore a new hybrid scene model that combines the advantages of view-invariant appearance features computed from raw images and view-dependent spatial-semantic features computed from synthesized images. These two types of features are then fused into scene graphs, and compressively learned and recognized by a graph neural network. The effectiveness of the proposed method was verified using a novel cross-view self-localization dataset with many unseen views generated using a photorealistic Habitat simulator.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 5 figures, technical report</p></details> |

VPR is particularly difficult due to the presence of duplicate regions and the lack of attention to small objects in complex scenes, resulting in recognition deviations. In this paper, we present ClusVPR, a novel approach that tackles the specific issues of redundant information in duplicate regions and representations of small objects. Different from existing methods that rely on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature map generation, ClusVPR introduces a unique paradigm called Clustering-based Weighted Transformer Network (CWTNet). CWTNet leverages the power of clustering-based weighted feature maps and integrates global dependencies to effectively address visual deviations encountered in large-scale VPR problems. We also introduce the optimized-VLAD (OptLAD) layer that significantly reduces the number of parameters and enhances model efficiency. This layer is specifically designed to aggregate the information obtained from scale-wise image patches. Additionally, our pyramid self-supervised strategy focuses on extracting representative and diverse information from scale-wise image patches instead of entire images, which is crucial for capturing representative and diverse information in VPR. Extensive experiments on four VPR datasets show our model's superior performance compared to existing models while being less complex.</p></details> |  |

Most research efforts focus on enhancing the accuracy and robustness of single-robot VPR but often encounter issues such as occlusion due to individual viewpoints. Despite a number of research on multi-robot metric-based localization, there is a notable gap in research concerning more robust and efficient place-based localization with a multi-robot system. This work proposes collaborative VPR, where multiple robots share abstracted visual features to enhance place recognition capabilities. We also introduce a novel collaborative VPR framework based on similarity-regularized information fusion, reducing irrelevant noise while harnessing valuable data from collaborators. This framework seamlessly integrates with well-established single-robot VPR techniques and supports end-to-end training with a weakly-supervised contrastive loss. We conduct experiments in urban, rural, and indoor scenes, achieving a notable improvement over single-agent VPR in urban environments (~12\%), along with consistent enhancements in rural (~3\%) and indoor (~1\%) scenarios.

Recently, the hierarchical two-stage VPR methods have become popular in this field due to the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. These methods retrieve the top-k candidate images using the global features in the first stage, then re-rank the candidates by matching the local features in the second stage. However, they usually require additional algorithms (e.g. RANSAC) for geometric consistency verification in re-ranking, which is time-consuming. Here we propose a Dynamically Aligning Local Features (DALF) algorithm to align the local features under spatial constraints. It is significantly more efficient than the methods that need geometric consistency verification. We present a unified network capable of extracting global features for retrieving candidates via an aggregation module and aligning local features for re-ranking via the DALF alignment module. We call this network AANet. Meanwhile, many works use the simplest positive samples in triplet for weakly supervised training, which limits the ability of the network to recognize harder positive pairs. To address this issue, we propose a Semi-hard Positive Sample Mining (ShPSM) strategy to select appropriate hard positive images for training more robust VPR networks. Extensive experiments on four benchmark VPR datasets show that the proposed AANet can outperform several state-of-the-art methods with less time consumption.

Current approaches face a clear limitation: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods produce high-quality results but require multiple views or video sequences, while video diffusion models can generate animations from single images but struggle with consistency and identity preservation. We present SVAD, a novel approach that addresses these limitations by leveraging complementary strengths of existing techniques. Our method generates synthetic training data through video diffusion, enhances it with identity preservation and image restoration modules, and utilizes this refined data to train 3DGS avatars. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that SVAD outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) single-image methods in maintaining identity consistency and fine details across novel poses and viewpoints, while enabling real-time rendering capabilities. Through our data augmentation pipeline, we overcome the dependency on dense monocular or multi-view training data typically required by traditional 3DGS approaches. Extensive quantitative, qualitative comparisons show our method achieves superior performance across multiple metrics against baseline models. By effectively combining the generative power of diffusion models with both the high-quality results and rendering efficiency of 3DGS, our work establishes a new approach for high-fidelity avatar generation from a single image input.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025 SyntaGen Workshop, Project Page: https://yc4ny.github.io/SVAD/</p></details> |

Quickly achieving high-fidelity dynamic 3D reconstruction from a single viewpoint is a significant challenge in computer vision. In C-ToF radiance field reconstruction, the property of interest-depth-is not directly measured, causing an additional challenge. This problem has a large and underappreciated impact upon the optimization when using a fast primitive-based scene representation like 3D Gaussian splatting, which is commonly used with multi-view data to produce satisfactory results and is brittle in its optimization otherwise. We incorporate two heuristics into the optimization to improve the accuracy of scene geometry represented by Gaussians. Experimental results show that our approach produces accurate reconstructions under constrained C-ToF sensing conditions, including for fast motions like swinging baseball bats. https://visual.cs.brown.edu/gftorf</p></details> |  |

However, training a 3DGS model remains a time-intensive task, especially in load imbalance scenarios where workload diversity among pixels and Gaussian spheres causes poor renderCUDA kernel performance. We introduce Balanced 3DGS, a Gaussian-wise parallelism rendering with fine-grained tiling approach in 3DGS training process, perfectly solving load-imbalance issues. First, we innovatively introduce the inter-block dynamic workload distribution technique to map workloads to Streaming Multiprocessor(SM) resources within a single GPU dynamically, which constitutes the foundation of load balancing. Second, we are the first to propose the Gaussian-wise parallel rendering technique to significantly reduce workload divergence inside a warp, which serves as a critical component in addressing load imbalance. Based on the above two methods, we further creatively put forward the fine-grained combined load balancing technique to uniformly distribute workload across all SMs, which boosts the forward renderCUDA kernel performance by up to 7.52x. Besides, we present a self-adaptive render kernel selection strategy during the 3DGS training process based on different load-balance situations, which effectively improves training efficiency.</p></details> |  |

We further refine these material parameters using video diffusion with a differentiable Material Point Method (MPM) and optical flow guidance rather than render loss or Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) loss. This integrated framework enables accurate prediction and realistic simulation of dynamic interactions in real-world scenarios, advancing both accuracy and flexibility in physics-based simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

In this work, we propose Coupled Score Distillation (CSD), a framework that couples multi-view joint distribution priors to ensure geometrically consistent 3D generation while enabling the stable and direct optimization of 3D Gaussian Splatting. Specifically, by reformulating the optimization as a multi-view joint optimization problem, we derive an effective optimization rule that effectively couples multi-view priors to guide optimization across different viewpoints while preserving the diversity of generated 3D assets. Additionally, we propose a framework that directly optimizes 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) with random initialization to generate geometrically consistent 3D content. We further employ a deformable tetrahedral grid, initialized from 3D-GS and refined through CSD, to produce high-quality, refined meshes. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and competitive quality of our approach.</p></details> |  |

The latest 3D Gaussian Splatting technique has achieved high quality novel view synthesis as well as fast rendering speed. However, 3D Gaussians lack proficiency in defining accurate 3D geometric structures despite their explicit primitive representations. This is due to the fact that Gaussian's attributes are primarily tailored and fine-tuned for rendering diverse 2D images by their anisotropic nature. To pave the way for efficient 3D reconstruction, we present Spherical Gaussians, a simple and effective representation for 3D geometric boundaries, from which we can directly reconstruct 3D feature curves from a set of calibrated multi-view images. Spherical Gaussians is optimized from grid initialization with a view-based rendering loss, where a 2D edge map is rendered at a specific view and then compared to the ground-truth edge map extracted from the corresponding image, without the need for any 3D guidance or supervision. Given Spherical Gaussians serve as intermedia for the robust edge representation, we further introduce a novel optimization-based algorithm called SGCR to directly extract accurate parametric curves from aligned Spherical Gaussians. We demonstrate that SGCR outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in 3D edge reconstruction while enjoying great efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>The I...</summary><p>The IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition 2025, 8 pages</p></details> |
| **[TranSplat: Lighting-Consistent Cross-Scene Object Transfer with 3D Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22676v2)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present TranSplat, a 3D scene rendering algorithm that enables realistic cross-scene object transfer (from a source to a target scene) based on the Gaussian Splatting framework. Our approach addresses two critical challenges: (1) precise 3D object extraction from the source scene, and (2) faithful relighting of the transferred object in the target scene without explicit material property estimation. TranSplat fits a splatting model to the source scene, using 2D object masks to drive fine-grained 3D segmentation. Following user-guided insertion of the object into the target scene, along with automatic refinement of position and orientation, TranSplat derives per-Gaussian radiance transfer functions via spherical harmonic analysis to adapt the object's appearance to match the target scene's lighting environment. This relighting strategy does not require explicitly estimating physical scene properties such as BRDFs.

| **[3D Gaussian Splatting Data Compression with Mixture of Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03310v1)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) data compression is crucial for enabling efficient storage and transmission in 3D scene modeling. However, its development remains limited due to inadequate entropy models and suboptimal quantization strategies for both lossless and lossy compression scenarios, where existing methods have yet to 1) fully leverage hyperprior information to construct robust conditional entropy models, and 2) apply fine-grained, element-wise quantization strategies for improved compression granularity. In this work, we propose a novel Mixture of Priors (MoP) strategy to simultaneously address these two challenges. Specifically, inspired by the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) paradigm, our MoP approach processes hyperprior information through multiple lightweight MLPs to generate diverse prior features, which are subsequently integrated into the MoP feature via a gating mechanism. To enhance lossless compression, the resulting MoP feature is utilized as a hyperprior to improve conditional entropy modeling. Meanwhile, for lossy compression, we employ the MoP feature as guidance information in an element-wise quantization procedure, leveraging a prior-guided Coarse-to-Fine Quantization (C2FQ) strategy with a predefined quantization step value. Specifically, we expand the quantization step value into a matrix and adaptively refine it from coarse to fine granularity, guided by the MoP feature, thereby obtaining a quantization step matrix that facilitates element-wise quantization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed 3DGS data compression framework achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, including Mip-NeRF360, BungeeNeRF, DeepBlending, and Tank&Temples.</p></details> |  |

However, its reliance on Gaussian kernels for geometry and low-order Spherical Harmonics (SH) for color encoding limits its ability to capture complex geometries and diverse colors. We introduce Deformable Beta Splatting (DBS), a deformable and compact approach that enhances both geometry and color representation. DBS replaces Gaussian kernels with deformable Beta Kernels, which offer bounded support and adaptive frequency control to capture fine geometric details with higher fidelity while achieving better memory efficiency. In addition, we extended the Beta Kernel to color encoding, which facilitates improved representation of diffuse and specular components, yielding superior results compared to SH-based methods. Furthermore, Unlike prior densification techniques that depend on Gaussian properties, we mathematically prove that adjusting regularized opacity alone ensures distribution-preserved Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), independent of the splatting kernel type. Experimental results demonstrate that DBS achieves state-of-the-art visual quality while utilizing only 45% of the parameters and rendering 1.5x faster than 3DGS-MCMC, highlighting the superior performance of DBS for real-time radiance field rendering. Interactive demonstrations and source code are available on our project website: https://rongliu-leo.github.io/beta-splatting/.</p></details> | SIGGRAPH 2025 |

Unlike existing methods (e.g., NeRF and 3D Gaussian Splatting), which struggle with view-dependent effects, RGS-DR utilizes a 2D Gaussian surfel representation to accurately estimate geometry and surface normals, an essential property for high-quality inverse rendering. Our approach explicitly models geometric and material properties through learnable primitives rasterized into a deferred shading pipeline, effectively reducing rendering artifacts and preserving sharp reflections. By employing a multi-level cube mipmap, RGS-DR accurately approximates environment lighting integrals, facilitating high-quality reconstruction and relighting. A residual pass with spherical-mipmap-based directional encoding further refines the appearance modeling. Experiments demonstrate that RGS-DR achieves high-quality reconstruction and rendering quality for shiny objects, often outperforming reconstruction-exclusive state-of-the-art methods incapable of relighting.</p></details> |  |

The advent of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enabled real-time, photorealistic NVS. Following this, 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) leveraged perspective accurate 2D Gaussian primitive rasterization to achieve accurate geometry representation during rendering, improving 3D scene reconstruction while maintaining real-time performance. Recent approaches have tackled the problem of sparse real-time NVS using 3DGS within a generalizable, MVS-based learning framework to regress 3D Gaussian parameters. Our work extends this line of research by addressing the challenge of generalizable sparse 3D reconstruction and NVS jointly, and manages to perform successfully at both tasks. We propose an MVS-based learning pipeline that regresses 2DGS surface element parameters in a feed-forward fashion to perform 3D shape reconstruction and NVS from sparse-view images. We further show that our generalizable pipeline can benefit from preexisting foundational multi-view deep visual features. The resulting model attains the state-of-the-art results on the DTU sparse 3D reconstruction benchmark in terms of Chamfer distance to ground-truth, as-well as state-of-the-art NVS. It also demonstrates strong generalization on the BlendedMVS and Tanks and Temples datasets. We note that our model outperforms the prior state-of-the-art in feed-forward sparse view reconstruction based on volume rendering of implicit representations, while offering an almost 2 orders of magnitude higher inference speed.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page : https://shubhendu-jena.github.io/SparSplat/</p></details> |

Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting has achieved breakthrough progress in 3D scene reconstruction and rendering, attracting widespread attention and opening new pathways for 3D garment reconstruction. However, due to the unstructured and irregular nature of Gaussian primitives, it is difficult to reconstruct high-fidelity, non-watertight 3D garments. In this paper, we present GarmentGS, a dense point cloud-guided method that can reconstruct high-fidelity garment surfaces with high geometric accuracy and generate non-watertight, single-layer meshes. Our method introduces a fast dense point cloud reconstruction module that can complete garment point cloud reconstruction in 10 minutes, compared to traditional methods that require several hours. Furthermore, we use dense point clouds to guide the movement, flattening, and rotation of Gaussian primitives, enabling better distribution on the garment surface to achieve superior rendering effects and geometric accuracy. Through numerical and visual comparisons, our method achieves fast training and real-time rendering while maintaining competitive quality.</p></details> |  |

They have long coding times and highly customized data format, making it difficult for widespread deployment. This paper presents a new 3DGS compression framework called HybridGS, which takes advantage of both compact generation and standardized point cloud data encoding. HybridGS first generates compact and explicit 3DGS data. A dual-channel sparse representation is introduced to supervise the primitive position and feature bit depth. It then utilizes a canonical point cloud encoder to perform further data compression and form standard output bitstreams. A simple and effective rate control scheme is proposed to pivot the interpretable data compression scheme. At the current stage, HybridGS does not include any modules aimed at improving 3DGS quality during generation. But experiment results show that it still provides comparable reconstruction performance against state-of-the-art methods, with evidently higher encoding and decoding speed. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/Qi-Yangsjtu/HybridGS.</p></details> | Accepted by ICML2025 |

However, the quality of underwater images is often degraded due to medium interference, which limits the effectiveness of Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pose estimation, leading to subsequent reconstruction failures. Additionally, SfM methods typically operate at slower speeds, further hindering their applicability in real-time scenarios. In this paper, we introduce AquaGS, an SfM-free underwater scene reconstruction model based on the SeaThru algorithm, which facilitates rapid and accurate separation of scene details and medium features. Our approach initializes Gaussians by integrating state-of-the-art multi-view stereo (MVS) technology, employs implicit Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) for rendering translucent media and utilizes the latest explicit 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) technique to render object surfaces, which effectively addresses the limitations of traditional methods and accurately simulates underwater optical phenomena. Experimental results on the data set and the robot platform show that our model can complete high-precision reconstruction in 30 seconds with only 3 image inputs, significantly enhancing the practical application of the algorithm in robotic platforms.</p></details> |  |

The hardware platform integrates a small camera, a standard airframe, offboard computation, and radio communication for manual overrides. We demonstrate FalconWing's capabilities by developing and deploying a purely vision-based control policy for autonomous landing (without IMU or motion capture) using a novel real-to-sim-to-real learning approach. Our learning approach: (1) constructs a photorealistic simulation environment via 3D Gaussian splatting trained on real-world images; (2) identifies nonlinear dynamics from vision-estimated real-flight data; and (3) trains a multi-modal Vision Transformer (ViT) policy through simulation-only imitation learning. The ViT architecture fuses single RGB image with the history of control actions via self-attention, preserving temporal context while maintaining real-time 20 Hz inference. When deployed zero-shot on the hardware platform, this policy achieves an 80% success rate in vision-based autonomous landings. Together with the hardware specifications, we also open-source the system dynamics, the software for photorealistic simulator and the learning approach.</p></details> |  |

However, previous online reconstruction approaches have primarily focused on efficiency and rendering quality, overlooking the temporal consistency of their results, which often contain noticeable artifacts in static regions. This paper identifies that errors such as noise in real-world recordings affect temporal inconsistency in online reconstruction. We propose a method that enhances temporal consistency in online reconstruction from observations with temporal inconsistency which is inevitable in cameras. We show that our method restores the ideal observation by subtracting the learned error.

Existing dynamic novel view synthesis (NVS) methods are highly sensitive to motion blur in casually captured videos, resulting in significant degradation of rendering quality. While recent approaches address motion-blurred inputs for NVS, they primarily focus on static scene reconstruction and lack dedicated motion modeling for dynamic objects. To overcome these limitations, our MoBGS introduces a novel Blur-adaptive Latent Camera Estimation (BLCE) method for effective latent camera trajectory estimation, improving global camera motion deblurring. In addition, we propose a physically-inspired Latent Camera-induced Exposure Estimation (LCEE) method to ensure consistent deblurring of both global camera and local object motion. Our MoBGS framework ensures the temporal consistency of unseen latent timestamps and robust motion decomposition of static and dynamic regions. Extensive experiments on the Stereo Blur dataset and real-world blurry videos show that our MoBGS significantly outperforms the very recent advanced methods (DyBluRF and Deblur4DGS), achieving state-of-the-art performance for dynamic NVS under motion blur.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally to this work (equal contribution).

Nonetheless, specular reflection and refraction continue to pose significant challenges due to the instability and incorrect overfitting of radiance fields to high-frequency light variations. Currently, even 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS), as a powerful and efficient tool, falls short in recovering transparent objects with nearby contents due to the existence of apparent secondary ray effects. To address this issue, we propose TransparentGS, a fast inverse rendering pipeline for transparent objects based on 3D-GS. The main contributions are three-fold. Firstly, an efficient representation of transparent objects, transparent Gaussian primitives, is designed to enable specular refraction through a deferred refraction strategy. Secondly, we leverage Gaussian light field probes (GaussProbe) to encode both ambient light and nearby contents in a unified framework. Thirdly, a depth-based iterative probes query (IterQuery) algorithm is proposed to reduce the parallax errors in our probe-based framework. Experiments demonstrate the speed and accuracy of our approach in recovering transparent objects from complex environments, as well as several applications in computer graphics and vision.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by SIGGRAPH 2025; https://letianhuang.github.io/transparentgs/</p></details> |

First, the method uses 3DGS to render a synthetic RGBD image at some initial pose estimate. Second, it establishes 2D-2D correspondences between the query image and this synthetic image. Third, it uses the depth map to lift the 2D-2D correspondences to 2D-3D correspondences and solves a perspective-n-point (PnP) problem to produce a final pose estimate. Results from evaluation across three existing datasets with 38 scenes and over 2,700 test images show that our method significantly reduces both inference time (by over two orders of magnitude, from more than 10 seconds to as fast as 0.1 seconds) and estimation error compared to baseline methods that use photometric loss minimization. Results also show that our method tolerates large errors in the initial pose estimate of up to 55{\deg} in rotation and 1.1 units in translation (normalized by scene scale), achieving final pose errors of less than 5{\deg} in rotation and 0.05 units in translation on 90% of images from the Synthetic NeRF and Mip-NeRF360 datasets and on 42% of images from the more challenging Tanks and Temples dataset.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce 4DGS-CC, a contextual coding framework that compresses 4DGS data to meet specific storage constraints. Building upon the established deformable 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) method, our approach decomposes 4DGS data into 4D neural voxels and a canonical 3DGS component, which are then compressed using Neural Voxel Contextual Coding (NVCC) and Vector Quantization Contextual Coding (VQCC), respectively. Specifically, we first decompose the 4D neural voxels into distinct quantized features by separating the temporal and spatial dimensions. To losslessly compress each quantized feature, we leverage the previously compressed features from the temporal and spatial dimensions as priors and apply NVCC to generate the spatiotemporal context for contextual coding. Next, we employ a codebook to store spherical harmonics information from canonical 3DGS as quantized vectors, which are then losslessly compressed by using VQCC with the auxiliary learned hyperpriors for contextual coding, thereby reducing redundancy within the codebook. By integrating NVCC and VQCC, our contextual coding framework, 4DGS-CC, enables multi-rate 4DGS data compression tailored to specific storage requirements. Extensive experiments on three 4DGS data compression benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves an average storage reduction of approximately 12 times while maintaining rendering fidelity compared to our baseline 4DGS approach.</p></details> |  |

This paper provides a comprehensive review of the 3D reconstruction techniques for plant phenotyping, covering classical reconstruction methods, emerging Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), and the novel 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) approach. Classical methods, which often rely on high-resolution sensors, are widely adopted due to their simplicity and flexibility in representing plant structures.

This paper presents the first systematic study of backdoor threats in 3DGS pipelines. We identify that adversaries may implant backdoor views to induce malicious scene confusion during inference, potentially leading to environmental misperception in autonomous navigation or spatial distortion in immersive environments. To uncover this risk, we propose GuassTrap, a novel poisoning attack method targeting 3DGS models. GuassTrap injects malicious views at specific attack viewpoints while preserving high-quality rendering in non-target views, ensuring minimal detectability and maximizing potential harm. Specifically, the proposed method consists of a three-stage pipeline (attack, stabilization, and normal training) to implant stealthy, viewpoint-consistent poisoned renderings in 3DGS, jointly optimizing attack efficacy and perceptual realism to expose security risks in 3D rendering. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that GuassTrap can effectively embed imperceptible yet harmful backdoor views while maintaining high-quality rendering in normal views, validating its robustness, adaptability, and practical applicability.</p></details> |  |

Visual quality is a critical aspect of 3D reconstruction. Recent advancements such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have notably enhanced the image rendering quality of reconstruction models. Nonetheless, the efficient and effective acquisition of input images for reconstruction-specifically, the selection of the most informative viewpoint-remains an open challenge, which is crucial for active reconstruction. Existing studies have primarily focused on evaluating geometric completeness and exploring unobserved or unknown regions, without direct evaluation of the visual uncertainty within the reconstruction model. To address this gap, this paper introduces a probabilistic model that quantifies visual uncertainty for each Gaussian. Leveraging Shannon Mutual Information, we formulate a criterion, Gaussian Splatting Shannon Mutual Information (GauSS-MI), for real-time assessment of visual mutual information from novel viewpoints, facilitating the selection of next best view. GauSS-MI is implemented within an active reconstruction system integrated with a view and motion planner. Extensive experiments across various simulated and real-world scenes showcase the superior visual quality and reconstruction efficiency performance of the proposed system.</p></details> |  |

Existing Neural SLAM or 3DGS-based SLAM methods often trade off between rendering quality and geometry accuracy, our research demonstrates that both can be achieved simultaneously with RGB input alone. The key idea of our approach is to enhance the ability for geometry estimation by combining easy-to-obtain monocular priors with learning-based dense SLAM, and then using 3D Gaussian splatting as our core map representation to efficiently model the scene. Upon loop closure, our method ensures on-the-fly global consistency through efficient pose graph bundle adjustment and instant map updates by explicitly deforming the 3D Gaussian units based on anchored keyframe updates. Furthermore, we introduce a grid-based scale alignment strategy to maintain improved scale consistency in prior depths for finer depth details. Through extensive experiments on Replica, ScanNet, and ScanNet++, we demonstrate significant improvements over existing Neural SLAM methods and even surpass RGB-D-based methods in both reconstruction and rendering quality.

Recent work on reconstructing the 3D human body using 3DGS attempts to leverage prior information on human pose to enhance rendering quality and improve training speed. However, it struggles to effectively fit dynamic surface planes due to multi-view inconsistency and redundant Gaussians. This inconsistency arises because Gaussian ellipsoids cannot accurately represent the surfaces of dynamic objects, which hinders the rapid reconstruction of the dynamic human body. Meanwhile, the prevalence of redundant Gaussians means that the training time of these works is still not ideal for quickly fitting a dynamic human body. To address these, we propose EfficientHuman, a model that quickly accomplishes the dynamic reconstruction of the human body using Articulated 2D Gaussian while ensuring high rendering quality. The key innovation involves encoding Gaussian splats as Articulated 2D Gaussian surfels in canonical space and then transforming them to pose space via Linear Blend Skinning (LBS) to achieve efficient pose transformations. Unlike 3D Gaussians, Articulated 2D Gaussian surfels can quickly conform to the dynamic human body while ensuring view-consistent geometries. Additionally, we introduce a pose calibration module and an LBS optimization module to achieve precise fitting of dynamic human poses, enhancing the model's performance. Extensive experiments on the ZJU-MoCap dataset demonstrate that EfficientHuman achieves rapid 3D dynamic human reconstruction in less than a minute on average, which is 20 seconds faster than the current state-of-the-art method, while also reducing the number of redundant Gaussians.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 figures |

Previous studies have explored the feasibility of 3D editing, but often struggle to generate visually pleasing results, possibly due to the unstable representation learning under mixed optimization of geometry and texture in complicated reconstructed scenarios. In this paper, we aim to provide an accessible solution for ordinary users to create their editable 3D avatars with precise region localization, geometric adaptability, and photorealistic renderings. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a meticulously designed framework that decouples the editing process into local spatial adaptation and realistic appearance learning, utilizing a hybrid Tetrahedron-constrained Gaussian Splatting (TetGS) as the underlying representation. TetGS combines the controllable explicit structure of tetrahedral grids with the high-precision rendering capabilities of 3D Gaussian Splatting and is optimized in a progressive manner comprising three stages: 3D avatar instantiation from real-world monocular videos to provide accurate priors for TetGS initialization; localized spatial adaptation with explicitly partitioned tetrahedrons to guide the redistribution of Gaussian kernels; and geometry-based appearance generation with a coarse-to-fine activation strategy. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our approach in generating photorealistic 3D editable avatars.</p></details> |  |

Images are rendered by interpolating surrounding SH Texels at each pixel s sampling point using a novel interpolation method. Conversely, gradients from each pixel are back-propagated to the related SH Texels in SH textures. Mesh-Learner exploits graphic features of rasterization pipeline (texture sampling, deferred rendering) to render, which makes Mesh-Learner naturally compatible with tools (e.g., Blender) and tasks (e.g., 3D reconstruction, scene rendering, reinforcement learning for robotics) that are based on rasterization pipelines. Our system can train vast, unlimited scenes because we transfer only the SH textures within the frustum to the GPU for training. At other times, the SH textures are stored in CPU RAM, which results in moderate GPU memory usage. The rendering results on interpolation and extrapolation sequences in the Replica and FAST-LIVO2 datasets achieve state-of-the-art performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods (e.g., 3D Gaussian Splatting and M2-Mapping). To benefit the society, the code will be available at https://github.com/hku-mars/Mesh-Learner.</p></details> |  |
| **[3D Gaussian Inpainting with Depth-Guided Cross-View Consistency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11801v2)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When performing 3D inpainting using novel-view rendering methods like Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) or 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), how to achieve texture and geometry consistency across camera views has been a challenge. In this paper, we propose a framework of 3D Gaussian Inpainting with Depth-Guided Cross-View Consistency (3DGIC) for cross-view consistent 3D inpainting. Guided by the rendered depth information from each training view, our 3DGIC exploits background pixels visible across different views for updating the inpainting mask, allowing us to refine the 3DGS for inpainting purposes.Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we confirm that our 3DGIC outperforms current state-of-the-art 3D inpainting methods quantitatively and qualitatively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025.

| **[CE-NPBG: Connectivity Enhanced Neural Point-Based Graphics for Novel View Synthesis in Autonomous Driving Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19557v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current point-based approaches encounter limitations in scalability and rendering quality when using large 3D point cloud maps because using them directly for novel view synthesis (NVS) leads to degraded visualizations. We identify the primary issue behind these low-quality renderings as a visibility mismatch between geometry and appearance, stemming from using these two modalities together. To address this problem, we present CE-NPBG, a new approach for novel view synthesis (NVS) in large-scale autonomous driving scenes. Our method is a neural point-based technique that leverages two modalities: posed images (cameras) and synchronized raw 3D point clouds (LiDAR). We first employ a connectivity relationship graph between appearance and geometry, which retrieves points from a large 3D point cloud map observed from the current camera perspective and uses them for rendering. By leveraging this connectivity, our method significantly improves rendering quality and enhances run-time and scalability by using only a small subset of points from the large 3D point cloud map. Our approach associates neural descriptors with the points and uses them to synthesize views. To enhance the encoding of these descriptors and elevate rendering quality, we propose a joint adversarial and point rasterization training. During training, we pair an image-synthesizer network with a multi-resolution discriminator. At inference, we decouple them and use the image-synthesizer to generate novel views. We also integrate our proposal into the recent 3D Gaussian Splatting work to highlight its benefits for improved rendering and scalability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in 2025 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW)</p></details> |
| **[GS-ROR$^2$: Bidirectional-guided 3DGS and SDF for Reflective Object Relighting and Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18544v3)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has shown a powerful capability for novel view synthesis due to its detailed expressive ability and highly efficient rendering speed. Unfortunately, creating relightable 3D assets and reconstructing faithful geometry with 3DGS is still problematic, particularly for reflective objects, as its discontinuous representation raises difficulties in constraining geometries. Volumetric signed distance field (SDF) methods provide robust geometry reconstruction, while the expensive ray marching hinders its real-time application and slows the training. Besides, these methods struggle to capture sharp geometric details. To this end, we propose to guide 3DGS and SDF bidirectionally in a complementary manner, including an SDF-aided Gaussian splatting for efficient optimization of the relighting model and a GS-guided SDF enhancement for high-quality geometry reconstruction. At the core of our SDF-aided Gaussian splatting is the mutual supervision of the depth and normal between blended Gaussians and SDF, which avoids the expensive volume rendering of SDF. Thanks to this mutual supervision, the learned blended Gaussians are well-constrained with a minimal time cost. As the Gaussians are rendered in a deferred shading mode, the alpha-blended Gaussians are smooth, while individual Gaussians may still be outliers, yielding floater artifacts. Therefore, we introduce an SDF-aware pruning strategy to remove Gaussian outliers located distant from the surface defined by SDF, avoiding floater issue. This way, our GS framework provides reasonable normal and achieves realistic relighting, while the mesh from depth is still problematic. Therefore, we design a GS-guided SDF refinement, which utilizes the blended normal from Gaussians to finetune SDF. With this enhancement, our method can further provide high-quality meshes for reflective objects at the cost of 17% extra training time.</p></details> |  |

While existing 3DGS methods perform well in scenes with minor view variation, large view changes from cross-view data pose optimization challenges for these methods. To address these issues, we propose a novel cross-view Gaussian Splatting method for large-scale scene reconstruction based on multi-branch construction and fusion. Our method independently reconstructs models from different sets of views as multiple independent branches to establish the baselines of Gaussian distribution, providing reliable priors for cross-view reconstruction during initialization and densification. Specifically, a gradient-aware regularization strategy is introduced to mitigate smoothing issues caused by significant view disparities. Additionally, a unique Gaussian supplementation strategy is utilized to incorporate complementary information of multi-branch into the cross-view model. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance in novel view synthesis compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Semantic SLAM, an online approach, integrates pose tracking, geometric reconstruction, and semantic mapping into a unified framework, shows significant potential. However, existing systems, which rely on 2D ground truth priors for supervision, are often limited by the sparsity and noise of these signals in real-world environments. To address this challenge, we propose GSFF-SLAM, a novel dense semantic SLAM system based on 3D Gaussian Splatting that leverages feature fields to achieve joint rendering of appearance, geometry, and N-dimensional semantic features. By independently optimizing feature gradients, our method supports semantic reconstruction using various forms of 2D priors, particularly sparse and noisy signals. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous methods in both tracking accuracy and photorealistic rendering quality. When utilizing 2D ground truth priors, GSFF-SLAM achieves state-of-the-art semantic segmentation performance with 95.03\% mIoU, while achieving up to 2.9$\times$ speedup with only marginal performance degradation.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods suffer several drawbacks, such as requiring multi-view data, time-consuming per-scene optimization, distorted geometry in occluded areas, and low visual quality in backgrounds. Our novel 3D scene reconstruction pipeline overcomes these limitations to tackle the aforesaid challenge. Specifically, we introduce a large-scale reconstruction model that leverages latents from a video diffusion model to predict 3D Gaussian Splattings of scenes in a feed-forward manner. The video diffusion model is designed to create videos precisely following specified camera trajectories, allowing it to generate compressed video latents that encode multi-view information while maintaining 3D consistency. We train the 3D reconstruction model to operate on the video latent space with a progressive learning strategy, enabling the efficient generation of high-quality, wide-scope, and generic 3D scenes. Extensive evaluations across various datasets affirm that our model significantly outperforms existing single-view 3D scene generation methods, especially with out-of-domain images. Thus, we demonstrate for the first time that a 3D reconstruction model can effectively be built upon the latent space of a diffusion model in order to realize efficient 3D scene generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://snap-research.github.io/wonderland/</p></details> |

We validate the effectiveness of PerfCam through a practical deployment within realistic test production lines in the pharmaceutical industry and contribute an openly published dataset to support further research and development in the field. The results demonstrate PerfCam's ability to deliver actionable insights through its precise digital twin capabilities, underscoring its value as an effective tool for developing usable digital twins in smart manufacturing environments and extracting operational analytics.</p></details> |  |

However, rendering large-scale volumes demands powerful GPUs and high-speed memory access for real-time performance. While existing novel view synthesis (NVS) methods offer faster rendering speeds with lower hardware requirements, the visible parts of a reconstructed scene are fixed and constrained by preset TF settings, significantly limiting user exploration. This paper introduces inverse volume rendering via Gaussian splatting (iVR-GS), an innovative NVS method that reduces the rendering cost while enabling scene editing for interactive volume exploration. Specifically, we compose multiple iVR-GS models associated with basic TFs covering disjoint visible parts to make the entire volumetric scene visible. Each basic model contains a collection of 3D editable Gaussians, where each Gaussian is a 3D spatial point that supports real-time scene rendering and editing. We demonstrate the superior reconstruction quality and composability of iVR-GS against other NVS solutions (Plenoxels, CCNeRF, and base 3DGS) on various volume datasets.

However, most works rely on low dynamic range (LDR) images, which limits the capturing of richer scene details. Some prior works have focused on high dynamic range (HDR) scene reconstruction, typically require capturing of multi-view sharp images with different exposure times at fixed camera positions during exposure times, which is time-consuming and challenging in practice. For a more flexible data acquisition, we propose a one-stage method: \textbf{CasualHDRSplat} to easily and robustly reconstruct the 3D HDR scene from casually captured videos with auto-exposure enabled, even in the presence of severe motion blur and varying unknown exposure time. \textbf{CasualHDRSplat} contains a unified differentiable physical imaging model which first applies continuous-time trajectory constraint to imaging process so that we can jointly optimize exposure time, camera response function (CRF), camera poses, and sharp 3D HDR scene.

We utilize neural radiance field submaps as supervision and achieve high-quality scene expression and online loop closure adjustments through Gaussian rendering of fused submaps. Our results on multiple real-world scenes and large-scale scene datasets demonstrate that our method can achieve accurate hole filling and high-quality scene expression, supporting monocular, stereo, and RGB-D inputs, and achieving state-of-the-art scene reconstruction and tracking performance.</p></details> | 9pages, 4 figures |

This challenge becomes more pronounced in multi-view scenarios, where variations in lighting and image signal processor (ISP) settings across viewpoints introduce photometric inconsistencies. Such lighting degradations and view-dependent variations pose substantial challenges to novel view synthesis (NVS) frameworks based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). To address this, we introduce Luminance-GS, a novel approach to achieving high-quality novel view synthesis results under diverse challenging lighting conditions using 3DGS. By adopting per-view color matrix mapping and view-adaptive curve adjustments, Luminance-GS achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results across various lighting conditions -- including low-light, overexposure, and varying exposure -- while not altering the original 3DGS explicit representation. Compared to previous NeRF- and 3DGS-based baselines, Luminance-GS provides real-time rendering speed with improved reconstruction quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025, project page: https://cuiziteng.github.io/Luminance_GS_web/</p></details> |

While recent advances like neural rendering and 3D Gaussian splatting have enabled high-quality digital human avatar creation and animation, most methods rely on multiple images or multi-view inputs, limiting their practicality for real-world use. In this paper, we propose SEGA, a novel approach for Single-imagE-based 3D drivable Gaussian head Avatar creation that combines generalized prior models with a new hierarchical UV-space Gaussian Splatting framework. SEGA seamlessly combines priors derived from large-scale 2D datasets with 3D priors learned from multi-view, multi-expression, and multi-ID data, achieving robust generalization to unseen identities while ensuring 3D consistency across novel viewpoints and expressions. We further present a hierarchical UV-space Gaussian Splatting framework that leverages FLAME-based structural priors and employs a dual-branch architecture to disentangle dynamic and static facial components effectively. The dynamic branch encodes expression-driven fine details, while the static branch focuses on expression-invariant regions, enabling efficient parameter inference and precomputation. This design maximizes the utility of limited 3D data and achieves real-time performance for animation and rendering. Additionally, SEGA performs person-specific fine-tuning to further enhance the fidelity and realism of the generated avatars. Experiments show our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in generalization ability, identity preservation, and expression realism, advancing one-shot avatar creation for practical applications.</p></details> |  |

Our method optimizes data partitioning and the reconstruction pipeline by incorporating a hierarchical neural Gaussian representation. We employ an enhanced block-based reconstruction pipeline focusing on improving reconstruction quality within each block and reducing the need for redundant training regions around block boundaries. By integrating neural Gaussian representation with a hierarchical architecture, we achieve high-quality scene rendering at a low computational cost. This is demonstrated by our state-of-the-art results on public benchmarks, which prove the effectiveness and advantages in large-scale urban scene representation.</p></details> |  |

However, such extreme sparsity levels limit the seamless usage of ToF depth in SLAM. In this work, we propose ToF-Splatting, the first 3D Gaussian Splatting-based SLAM pipeline tailored for using effectively very sparse ToF input data. Our approach improves upon the state of the art by introducing a multi-frame integration module, which produces dense depth maps by merging cues from extremely sparse ToF depth, monocular color, and multi-view geometry. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real sparse ToF datasets demonstrate the viability of our approach, as it achieves state-of-the-art tracking and mapping performances on reference datasets.</p></details> |  |

Training to get a 3DGS scene often takes a lot of time and resources and even valuable inspiration. The increasing amount of 3DGS digital asset have brought great challenges to the copyright protection. However, it still lacks profound exploration targeted at 3DGS. In this paper, we propose a new framework X-SG$^2$S which can simultaneously watermark 1 to 3D messages while keeping the original 3DGS scene almost unchanged. Generally, we have a X-SG$^2$S injector for adding multi-modal messages simultaneously and an extractor for extract them. Specifically, we first split the watermarks into message patches in a fixed manner and sort the 3DGS points. A self-adaption gate is used to pick out suitable location for watermarking. Then use a XD(multi-dimension)-injection heads to add multi-modal messages into sorted 3DGS points. A learnable gate can recognize the location with extra messages and XD-extraction heads can restore hidden messages from the location recommended by the learnable gate. Extensive experiments demonstrated that the proposed X-SG$^2$S can effectively conceal multi modal messages without changing pretrained 3DGS pipeline or the original form of 3DGS parameters. Meanwhile, with simple and efficient model structure and high practicality, X-SG$^2$S still shows good performance in hiding and extracting multi-modal inner structured or unstructured messages. X-SG$^2$S is the first to unify 1 to 3D watermarking model for 3DGS and the first framework to add multi-modal watermarks simultaneous in one 3DGS which pave the wave for later researches.</p></details> |  |

This paper extends 3DGS capabilities to inpainting, where masked objects in a scene are replaced with new contents that blend seamlessly with the surroundings. Unlike 2D image inpainting, 3D Gaussian inpainting (3DGI) is challenging in effectively leveraging complementary visual and semantic cues from multiple input views, as occluded areas in one view may be visible in others. To address this, we propose a method that measures the visibility uncertainties of 3D points across different input views and uses them to guide 3DGI in utilizing complementary visual cues. We also employ uncertainties to learn a semantic concept of scene without the masked object and use a diffusion model to fill masked objects in input images based on the learned concept. Finally, we build a novel 3DGI framework, VISTA, by integrating VISibility-uncerTainty-guided 3DGI with scene conceptuAl learning. VISTA generates high-quality 3DGS models capable of synthesizing artifact-free and naturally inpainted novel views. Furthermore, our approach extends to handling dynamic distractors arising from temporal object changes, enhancing its versatility in diverse scene reconstruction scenarios. We demonstrate the superior performance of our method over state-of-the-art techniques using two challenging datasets: the SPIn-NeRF dataset, featuring 10 diverse static 3D inpainting scenes, and an underwater 3D inpainting dataset derived from UTB180, including fast-moving fish as inpainting targets.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 12 figures, ICCV</p></details> |

Building on anchor-based 3DGS methodologies, our approach compresses all attributes within each anchor by introducing a novel Hybrid Entropy Model for 3D Gaussian Splatting (HEMGS) to achieve hybrid lossy-lossless compression. It consists of three main components: a variable-rate predictor, a hyperprior network, and an autoregressive network. First, unlike previous methods that adopt multiple models to achieve multi-rate lossy compression, thereby increasing training overhead, our variable-rate predictor enables variable-rate compression with a single model and a hyperparameter $\lambda$ by producing a learned Quantization Step feature for versatile lossy compression. Second, to improve lossless compression, the hyperprior network captures both scene-agnostic and scene-specific features to generate a prior feature, while the autoregressive network employs an adaptive context selection algorithm with flexible receptive fields to produce a contextual feature. By integrating these two features, HEMGS can accurately estimate the distribution of the current coding element within each attribute, enabling improved entropy coding and reduced storage. We integrate HEMGS into a compression framework, and experimental results on four benchmarks indicate that HEMGS achieves about a 40% average reduction in size while maintaining rendering quality over baseline methods and achieving state-of-the-art compression results.</p></details> |  |

To unleash the potential of 3DGR for CT imaging scenario, we propose two key innovations: (i) FBP-image-guided Guassian initialization and (ii) efficient integration with a differentiable CT projector. Extensive experiments and ablations on diverse datasets demonstrate the proposed 3DGR-CT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art counterpart methods, achieving higher reconstruction accuracy with faster convergence.

Some recent methods based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) are proposed to reconstruct the thermal scenes in 3D from a set of thermal and RGB images. However, unlike NeRF, 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) prevails due to its rapid training and real-time rendering. In this work, we propose ThermalGaussian, the first thermal 3DGS approach capable of rendering high-quality images in RGB and thermal modalities. We first calibrate the RGB camera and the thermal camera to ensure that both modalities are accurately aligned. Subsequently, we use the registered images to learn the multimodal 3D Gaussians. To prevent the overfitting of any single modality, we introduce several multimodal regularization constraints. We also develop smoothing constraints tailored to the physical characteristics of the thermal modality. Besides, we contribute a real-world dataset named RGBT-Scenes, captured by a hand-hold thermal-infrared camera, facilitating future research on thermal scene reconstruction. We conduct comprehensive experiments to show that ThermalGaussian achieves photorealistic rendering of thermal images and improves the rendering quality of RGB images.

We propose StyleMe3D, a holistic framework for 3D GS style transfer that integrates multi-modal style conditioning, multi-level semantic alignment, and perceptual quality enhancement. Our key insights include: (1) optimizing only RGB attributes preserves geometric integrity during stylization; (2) disentangling low-, medium-, and high-level semantics is critical for coherent style transfer; (3) scalability across isolated objects and complex scenes is essential for practical deployment. StyleMe3D introduces four novel components: Dynamic Style Score Distillation (DSSD), leveraging Stable Diffusion's latent space for semantic alignment; Contrastive Style Descriptor (CSD) for localized, content-aware texture transfer; Simultaneously Optimized Scale (SOS) to decouple style details and structural coherence; and 3D Gaussian Quality Assessment (3DG-QA), a differentiable aesthetic prior trained on human-rated data to suppress artifacts and enhance visual harmony. Evaluated on NeRF synthetic dataset (objects) and tandt db (scenes) datasets, StyleMe3D outperforms state-of-the-art methods in preserving geometric details (e.g., carvings on sculptures) and ensuring stylistic consistency across scenes (e.g., coherent lighting in landscapes), while maintaining real-time rendering.

Geometry reconstruction can benefit from incorporating differentiable appearance models, such as Neural Radiance Fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). However, existing methods encounter efficiency issues due to indirect geometry learning and the paradigm of separately modeling geometry and surface appearance. In this work, we propose a learnable scene model that incorporates 3DGS with an explicit geometry representation, namely a mesh. Our model learns the mesh and appearance in an end-to-end manner, where we bind 3D Gaussians to the mesh faces and perform differentiable rendering of 3DGS to obtain photometric supervision. The model creates an effective information pathway to supervise the learning of both 3DGS and mesh. Experimental results demonstrate that the learned scene model not only improves efficiency and rendering quality but also enables manipulation via the explicit mesh. In addition, our model has a unique advantage in adapting to scene updates, thanks to the end-to-end learning of both mesh and appearance.</p></details> |  |
| **[DARB-Splatting: Generalizing Splatting with Decaying Anisotropic Radial Basis Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12369v2)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Splatting-based 3D reconstruction methods have gained popularity with the advent of 3D Gaussian Splatting, efficiently synthesizing high-quality novel views. These methods commonly resort to using exponential family functions, such as the Gaussian function, as reconstruction kernels due to their anisotropic nature, ease of projection, and differentiability in rasterization. However, the field remains restricted to variations within the exponential family, leaving generalized reconstruction kernels largely underexplored, partly due to the lack of easy integrability in 3D to 2D projections. In this light, we show that a class of decaying anisotropic radial basis functions (DARBFs), which are non-negative functions of the Mahalanobis distance, supports splatting by approximating the Gaussian function's closed-form integration advantage. With this fresh perspective, we demonstrate up to 34% faster convergence during training and a 45% reduction in memory consumption across various DARB reconstruction kernels, while maintaining comparable PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS results. We will make the code available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Link ...</summary><p>Link to the project page: https://randomnerds.github.io/darbs.github.io/</p></details> |

However, the limited information from single-view input, combined with the complex head poses and facial movements, makes this challenging. Previous methods achieve real-time performance by combining 3D Gaussian Splatting with a parametric head model, but the resulting head quality suffers from inaccurate face tracking and limited expressiveness of the deformation model. These methods also fail to produce realistic effects under novel lighting conditions. To address these issues, we propose HRAvatar, a 3DGS-based method that reconstructs high-fidelity, relightable 3D head avatars. HRAvatar reduces tracking errors through end-to-end optimization and better captures individual facial deformations using learnable blendshapes and learnable linear blend skinning. Additionally, it decomposes head appearance into several physical properties and incorporates physically-based shading to account for environmental lighting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HRAvatar not only reconstructs superior-quality heads but also achieves realistic visual effects under varying lighting conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025,Project page: https://eastbeanzhang.github.io/HRAvatar</p></details> |
| **[Scene4U: Hierarchical Layered 3D Scene Reconstruction from Single Panoramic Image for Your Immerse Exploration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00387v2)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The reconstruction of immersive and realistic 3D scenes holds significant practical importance in various fields of computer vision and computer graphics. Typically, immersive and realistic scenes should be free from obstructions by dynamic objects, maintain global texture consistency, and allow for unrestricted exploration. The current mainstream methods for image-driven scene construction involves iteratively refining the initial image using a moving virtual camera to generate the scene. However, previous methods struggle with visual discontinuities due to global texture inconsistencies under varying camera poses, and they frequently exhibit scene voids caused by foreground-background occlusions. To this end, we propose a novel layered 3D scene reconstruction framework from panoramic image, named Scene4U. Specifically, Scene4U integrates an open-vocabulary segmentation model with a large language model to decompose a real panorama into multiple layers. Then, we employs a layered repair module based on diffusion model to restore occluded regions using visual cues and depth information, generating a hierarchical representation of the scene. The multi-layer panorama is then initialized as a 3D Gaussian Splatting representation, followed by layered optimization, which ultimately produces an immersive 3D scene with semantic and structural consistency that supports free exploration. Scene4U outperforms state-of-the-art method, improving by 24.24% in LPIPS and 24.40% in BRISQUE, while also achieving the fastest training speed. Additionally, to demonstrate the robustness of Scene4U and allow users to experience immersive scenes from various landmarks, we build WorldVista3D dataset for 3D scene reconstruction, which contains panoramic images of globally renowned sites. The implementation code and dataset will be released at https://github.com/LongHZ140516/Scene4U .</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025, 11 pages, 7 figures</p></details> |

Our method simulates realistic 3D perspectives, effectively augmenting existing hard visual prompts by enforcing geometric consistency across viewpoints. This training-free strategy seamlessly integrates with prior hard visual prompts, enriching object-descriptive features and enabling VLMs to achieve more robust and accurate 3D instance segmentation in diverse 3D scenes.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 4 figures, Scandinavian Conference on Image Analysis 2025</p></details> |

Recently, many methods based on the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) framework have been proposed to address sparse-view 3D reconstruction. Although these methods have made considerable advancements, they still show significant issues with overfitting. To reduce the overfitting, we introduce VGNC, a novel Validation-guided Gaussian Number Control (VGNC) approach based on generative novel view synthesis (NVS) models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to alleviate the overfitting issue of sparse-view 3DGS with generative validation images. Specifically, we first introduce a validation image generation method based on a generative NVS model. We then propose a Gaussian number control strategy that utilizes generated validation images to determine the optimal Gaussian numbers, thereby reducing the issue of overfitting. We conducted detailed experiments on various sparse-view 3DGS baselines and datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of VGNC. Extensive experiments show that our approach not only reduces overfitting but also improves rendering quality on the test set while decreasing the number of Gaussian points. This reduction lowers storage demands and accelerates both training and rendering. The code will be released.</p></details> | 10 pages,8 figures |
| **[Metamon-GS: Enhancing Representability with Variance-Guided Densification and Light Encoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14460v1)** | 2025-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The introduction of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has advanced novel view synthesis by utilizing Gaussians to represent scenes. Encoding Gaussian point features with anchor embeddings has significantly enhanced the performance of newer 3DGS variants. While significant advances have been made, it is still challenging to boost rendering performance. Feature embeddings have difficulty accurately representing colors from different perspectives under varying lighting conditions, which leads to a washed-out appearance. Another reason is the lack of a proper densification strategy that prevents Gaussian point growth in thinly initialized areas, resulting in blurriness and needle-shaped artifacts. To address them, we propose Metamon-GS, from innovative viewpoints of variance-guided densification strategy and multi-level hash grid. The densification strategy guided by variance specifically targets Gaussians with high gradient variance in pixels and compensates for the importance of regions with extra Gaussians to improve reconstruction. The latter studies implicit global lighting conditions and accurately interprets color from different perspectives and feature embeddings. Our thorough experiments on publicly available datasets show that Metamon-GS surpasses its baseline model and previous versions, delivering superior quality in rendering novel views.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Gaussian Splatting with Localized Points Management](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04251v3)** | 2025-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Point management is critical for optimizing 3D Gaussian Splatting models, as point initiation (e.g., via structure from motion) is often distributionally inappropriate. Typically, Adaptive Density Control (ADC) algorithm is adopted, leveraging view-averaged gradient magnitude thresholding for point densification, opacity thresholding for pruning, and regular all-points opacity reset. We reveal that this strategy is limited in tackling intricate/special image regions (e.g., transparent) due to inability of identifying all 3D zones requiring point densification, and lacking an appropriate mechanism to handle ill-conditioned points with negative impacts (e.g., occlusion due to false high opacity). To address these limitations, we propose a Localized Point Management (LPM) strategy, capable of identifying those error-contributing zones in greatest need for both point addition and geometry calibration. Zone identification is achieved by leveraging the underlying multiview geometry constraints, subject to image rendering errors. We apply point densification in the identified zones and then reset the opacity of the points in front of these regions, creating a new opportunity to correct poorly conditioned points. Serving as a versatile plugin, LPM can be seamlessly integrated into existing static 3D and dynamic 4D Gaussian Splatting models with minimal additional cost. Experimental evaluations validate the efficacy of our LPM in boosting a variety of existing 3D/4D models both quantitatively and qualitatively. Notably, LPM improves both static 3DGS and dynamic SpaceTimeGS to achieve state-of-the-art rendering quality while retaining real-time speeds, excelling on challenging datasets such as Tanks & Temples and the Neural 3D Video dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025 (Highlight).

While recent NeRF-based approaches have shown promising results, most suffer from high computational costs, and some rely on carefully captured or pre-processed data--such as RAW sensor inputs or multi-exposure sequences--which severely limits their practicality. In contrast, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables real-time rendering with competitive visual fidelity; however, existing 3DGS-based methods struggle with low-light sRGB inputs, resulting in unstable Gaussian initialization and ineffective noise suppression. To address these challenges, we propose LL-Gaussian, a novel framework for 3D reconstruction and enhancement from low-light sRGB images, enabling pseudo normal-light novel view synthesis. Our method introduces three key innovations: 1) an end-to-end Low-Light Gaussian Initialization Module (LLGIM) that leverages dense priors from learning-based MVS approach to generate high-quality initial point clouds; 2) a dual-branch Gaussian decomposition model that disentangles intrinsic scene properties (reflectance and illumination) from transient interference, enabling stable and interpretable optimization; 3) an unsupervised optimization strategy guided by both physical constrains and diffusion prior to jointly steer decomposition and enhancement. Additionally, we contribute a challenging dataset collected in extreme low-light environments and demonstrate the effectiveness of LL-Gaussian. Compared to state-of-the-art NeRF-based methods, LL-Gaussian achieves up to 2,000 times faster inference and reduces training time to just 2%, while delivering superior reconstruction and rendering quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://sunhao242.github.io/LL-Gaussian_web.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[SwinGS: Sliding Window Gaussian Splatting for Volumetric Video Streaming with Arbitrary Length](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07759v3)** | 2025-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have garnered significant attention in computer vision and computer graphics due to its high rendering speed and remarkable quality. While extant research has endeavored to extend the application of 3DGS from static to dynamic scenes, such efforts have been consistently impeded by excessive model sizes, constraints on video duration, and content deviation. These limitations significantly compromise the streamability of dynamic 3D Gaussian models, thereby restricting their utility in downstream applications, including volumetric video, autonomous vehicle, and immersive technologies such as virtual, augmented, and mixed reality. This paper introduces SwinGS, a novel framework for training, delivering, and rendering volumetric video in a real-time streaming fashion. To address the aforementioned challenges and enhance streamability, SwinGS integrates spacetime Gaussian with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to adapt the model to fit various 3D scenes across frames, in the meantime employing a sliding window captures Gaussian snapshots for each frame in an accumulative way. We implement a prototype of SwinGS and demonstrate its streamability across various datasets and scenes. Additionally, we develop an interactive WebGL viewer enabling real-time volumetric video playback on most devices with modern browsers, including smartphones and tablets. Experimental results show that SwinGS reduces transmission costs by 83.6% compared to previous work and could be easily scaled to volumetric videos with arbitrary length with no increasing of required GPU resources.</p></details> |  |

Recent neural rendering advances have enabled holistic human-scene reconstruction but require pre-calibrated camera and human poses, and days of training time. In this work, we introduce a novel unified framework that simultaneously performs camera tracking, human pose estimation and human-scene reconstruction in an online fashion. 3D Gaussian Splatting is utilized to learn Gaussian primitives for humans and scenes efficiently, and reconstruction-based camera tracking and human pose estimation modules are designed to enable holistic understanding and effective disentanglement of pose and appearance. Specifically, we design a human deformation module to reconstruct the details and enhance generalizability to out-of-distribution poses faithfully. Aiming to learn the spatial correlation between human and scene accurately, we introduce occlusion-aware human silhouette rendering and monocular geometric priors, which further improve reconstruction quality. Experiments on the EMDB and NeuMan datasets demonstrate superior or on-par performance with existing methods in camera tracking, human pose estimation, novel view synthesis and runtime.

Recent methods have adopt 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to produce 3D scenes due to its efficient training process. However, these methodologies may generate incomplete 3D scenes or blurred multiviews. This is because of (1) inaccurate 3DGS point initialization and (2) the tendency of 3DGS to flatten 3D Gaussians with the sparse-view input. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework EG-Gaussian, which utilizes epipolar geometry and graph networks for 3D scene reconstruction. Initially, we integrate epipolar geometry into the 3DGS initialization phase to enhance initial 3DGS point construction. Then, we specifically design a graph learning module to refine 3DGS spatial features, in which we incorporate both spatial coordinates and angular relationships among neighboring points. Experiments on indoor and outdoor benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves reconstruction accuracy compared to 3DGS-based methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Volume Encoding Gaussians: Transfer Function-Agnostic 3D Gaussians for Volume Rendering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13339v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While HPC resources are increasingly being used to produce adaptively refined or unstructured volume datasets, current research in applying machine learning-based representation to visualization has largely ignored this type of data. To address this, we introduce Volume Encoding Gaussians (VEG), a novel 3D Gaussian-based representation for scientific volume visualization focused on unstructured volumes. Unlike prior 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods that store view-dependent color and opacity for each Gaussian, VEG decouple the visual appearance from the data representation by encoding only scalar values, enabling transfer-function-agnostic rendering of 3DGS models for interactive scientific visualization. VEG are directly initialized from volume datasets, eliminating the need for structure-from-motion pipelines like COLMAP. To ensure complete scalar field coverage, we introduce an opacity-guided training strategy, using differentiable rendering with multiple transfer functions to optimize our data representation. This allows VEG to preserve fine features across the full scalar range of a dataset while remaining independent of any specific transfer function. Each Gaussian is scaled and rotated to adapt to local geometry, allowing for efficient representation of unstructured meshes without storing mesh connectivity and while using far fewer primitives. Across a diverse set of data, VEG achieve high reconstruction quality, compress large volume datasets by up to 3600x, and support lightning-fast rendering on commodity GPUs, enabling interactive visualization of large-scale structured and unstructured volumes.</p></details> |  |

However, current methods rely on 2D diffusion models without adequately considering multi-view information, resulting in multi-view inconsistency. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) significantly improves rendering quality and speed, its 3D editing process encounters difficulties with inefficient optimization, as pre-trained Gaussians retain excessive source information, hindering optimization. To address these limitations, we propose EditSplat, a novel text-driven 3D scene editing framework that integrates Multi-view Fusion Guidance (MFG) and Attention-Guided Trimming (AGT). Our MFG ensures multi-view consistency by incorporating essential multi-view information into the diffusion process, leveraging classifier-free guidance from the text-to-image diffusion model and the geometric structure inherent to 3DGS. Additionally, our AGT utilizes the explicit representation of 3DGS to selectively prune and optimize 3D Gaussians, enhancing optimization efficiency and enabling precise, semantically rich local editing. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations, EditSplat achieves state-of-the-art performance, establishing a new benchmark for text-driven 3D scene editing.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches address these issues by augmenting image observations in RGB space or employing Real-to-Sim-to-Real pipelines based on physical simulators. However, the former is constrained to 2D data augmentation, while the latter suffers from imprecise physical simulation caused by inaccurate geometric reconstruction. This paper introduces RoboSplat, a novel method that generates diverse, visually realistic demonstrations by directly manipulating 3D Gaussians. Specifically, we reconstruct the scene through 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), directly edit the reconstructed scene, and augment data across six types of generalization with five techniques: 3D Gaussian replacement for varying object types, scene appearance, and robot embodiments; equivariant transformations for different object poses; visual attribute editing for various lighting conditions; novel view synthesis for new camera perspectives; and 3D content generation for diverse object types. Comprehensive real-world experiments demonstrate that RoboSplat significantly enhances the generalization of visuomotor policies under diverse disturbances. Notably, while policies trained on hundreds of real-world demonstrations with additional 2D data augmentation achieve an average success rate of 57.2%, RoboSplat attains 87.8% in one-shot settings across six types of generalization in the real world.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at Robotics: Science and Systems (RSS) 2025</p></details> |

While recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled fast and high-quality scene reconstruction, research has also explored incorporating open-vocabulary understanding into 3DGS. However, most existing methods require iterative optimization over per-view 2D semantic feature maps, which not only results in inefficiencies but also leads to inconsistent 3D semantics across views. To address these limitations, we introduce a training-free framework that constructs a superpoint graph directly from Gaussian primitives. The superpoint graph partitions the scene into spatially compact and semantically coherent regions, forming view-consistent 3D entities and providing a structured foundation for open-vocabulary understanding. Based on the graph structure, we design an efficient reprojection strategy that lifts 2D semantic features onto the superpoints, avoiding costly multi-view iterative training. The resulting representation ensures strong 3D semantic coherence and naturally supports hierarchical understanding, enabling both coarse- and fine-grained open-vocabulary perception within a unified semantic field. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art open-vocabulary segmentation performance, with semantic field reconstruction completed over $30\times$ faster.

These avatars bridge the gap between the physical and digital worlds, improving the user experience through realistic human representation. However, existing avatar creation techniques face significant challenges, including high costs, long creation times, and limited utility in virtual applications. Manual methods, such as MetaHuman, require extensive time and expertise, while automatic approaches, such as NeRF-based pipelines often lack efficiency, detailed facial expression fidelity, and are unable to be rendered at a speed sufficent for real-time applications. By involving several cutting-edge modern techniques, we introduce an end-to-end 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) avatar creation pipeline that leverages monocular video input to create a scalable and efficient photorealistic avatar directly compatible with the Unity game engine. Our pipeline incorporates a novel Gaussian splatting technique with customized preprocessing that enables the user of "in the wild" monocular video capture, detailed facial expression reconstruction and embedding within a fully rigged avatar model. Additionally, we present a Unity-integrated Gaussian Splatting Avatar Editor, offering a user-friendly environment for VR/AR application development. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our preprocessing pipeline in standardizing custom data for 3DGS training and demonstrate the versatility of Gaussian avatars in Unity, highlighting the scalability and practicality of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Second-order Optimization of Gaussian Splats with Importance Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12905v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is widely used for novel view synthesis due to its high rendering quality and fast inference time. However, 3DGS predominantly relies on first-order optimizers such as Adam, which leads to long training times. To address this limitation, we propose a novel second-order optimization strategy based on Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) and Conjugate Gradient (CG), which we specifically tailor towards Gaussian Splatting. Our key insight is that the Jacobian in 3DGS exhibits significant sparsity since each Gaussian affects only a limited number of pixels. We exploit this sparsity by proposing a matrix-free and GPU-parallelized LM optimization. To further improve its efficiency, we propose sampling strategies for both the camera views and loss function and, consequently, the normal equation, significantly reducing the computational complexity. In addition, we increase the convergence rate of the second-order approximation by introducing an effective heuristic to determine the learning rate that avoids the expensive computation cost of line search methods. As a result, our method achieves a $3\times$ speedup over standard LM and outperforms Adam by $~6\times$ when the Gaussian count is low while remaining competitive for moderate counts.

We argue that incorporating full 3D evaluation of Gaussians throughout the 3DGS pipeline can effectively address these issues while preserving rasterization efficiency. Specifically, we introduce an adaptive 3D smoothing filter to mitigate aliasing and present a stable view-space bounding method that eliminates popping artifacts when Gaussians extend beyond the view frustum. Furthermore, we promote tile-based culling to 3D with screen-space planes, accelerating rendering and reducing sorting costs for hierarchical rasterization. Our method achieves state-of-the-art quality on in-distribution evaluation sets and significantly outperforms other approaches for out-of-distribution views. Our qualitative evaluations further demonstrate the effective removal of aliasing, distortions, and popping artifacts, ensuring real-time, artifact-free rendering.</p></details> |  |

We introduce CAGE-GS, a cage-based 3DGS deformation method that seamlessly aligns a source 3DGS scene with a user-defined target shape. Our approach learns a deformation cage from the target, which guides the geometric transformation of the source scene. While the cages effectively control structural alignment, preserving the textural appearance of 3DGS remains challenging due to the complexity of covariance parameters. To address this, we employ a Jacobian matrix-based strategy to update the covariance parameters of each Gaussian, ensuring texture fidelity post-deformation. Our method is highly flexible, accommodating various target shape representations, including texts, images, point clouds, meshes and 3DGS models. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on both public datasets and newly proposed scenes demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing techniques in both efficiency and deformation quality.</p></details> |  |

These methods often encounter a transparency-depth dilemma, where the pursuit of photorealistic rendering through standard $\alpha$-blending undermines geometric precision, resulting in considerable depth estimation errors for transparent materials. To address this issue, we introduce Transparent Surface Gaussian Splatting (TSGS), a new framework that separates geometry learning from appearance refinement. In the geometry learning stage, TSGS focuses on geometry by using specular-suppressed inputs to accurately represent surfaces. In the second stage, TSGS improves visual fidelity through anisotropic specular modeling, crucially maintaining the established opacity to ensure geometric accuracy. To enhance depth inference, TSGS employs a first-surface depth extraction method. This technique uses a sliding window over $\alpha$-blending weights to pinpoint the most likely surface location and calculates a robust weighted average depth. To evaluate the transparent surface reconstruction task under realistic conditions, we collect a TransLab dataset that includes complex transparent laboratory glassware. Extensive experiments on TransLab show that TSGS achieves accurate geometric reconstruction and realistic rendering of transparent objects simultaneously within the efficient 3DGS framework. Specifically, TSGS significantly surpasses current leading methods, achieving a 37.3% reduction in chamfer distance and an 8.0% improvement in F1 score compared to the top baseline.

This drag operation has been incorporated into numerous methods to facilitate the editing of 2D images and 3D meshes in design. However, few studies have explored drag-driven editing for the widely-used 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation, as deforming 3DGS while preserving shape coherence and visual continuity remains challenging. In this paper, we introduce ARAP-GS, a drag-driven 3DGS editing framework based on As-Rigid-As-Possible (ARAP) deformation. Unlike previous 3DGS editing methods, we are the first to apply ARAP deformation directly to 3D Gaussians, enabling flexible, drag-driven geometric transformations. To preserve scene appearance after deformation, we incorporate an advanced diffusion prior for image super-resolution within our iterative optimization process. This approach enhances visual quality while maintaining multi-view consistency in the edited results. Experiments show that ARAP-GS outperforms current methods across diverse 3D scenes, demonstrating its effectiveness and superiority for drag-driven 3DGS editing. Additionally, our method is highly efficient, requiring only 10 to 20 minutes to edit a scene on a single RTX 3090 GPU.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we combine 3D human pose and shape estimation with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), a representation of the scene composed of a mixture of Gaussians. This allows training or fine-tuning a human model predictor on multi-view images alone, without 3D ground truth. Predicting such mixtures for a human from a single input image is challenging due to self-occlusions and dependence on articulations, while also needing to retain enough flexibility to accommodate a variety of clothes and poses. Our key observation is that the vertices of standardized human meshes (such as SMPL) can provide an adequate spatial density and approximate initial position for the Gaussians. We can then train a transformer model to jointly predict comparatively small adjustments to these positions, as well as the other 3DGS attributes and the SMPL parameters. We show empirically that this combination (using only multi-view supervision) can achieve near real-time inference of 3D human models from a single image without expensive diffusion models or 3D points supervision, thus making it ideal for the sport industry at any level. More importantly, rendering is an effective auxiliary objective to refine 3D pose estimation by accounting for clothes and other geometric variations.

While recent advances leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for high-fidelity and real-time rendering, existing methods are often specialized and task-focused, lacking a unified framework for both generation and editing. In this paper, we introduce SplatFlow, a comprehensive framework that addresses this gap by enabling direct 3DGS generation and editing. SplatFlow comprises two main components: a multi-view rectified flow (RF) model and a Gaussian Splatting Decoder (GSDecoder). The multi-view RF model operates in latent space, generating multi-view images, depths, and camera poses simultaneously, conditioned on text prompts, thus addressing challenges like diverse scene scales and complex camera trajectories in real-world settings. Then, the GSDecoder efficiently translates these latent outputs into 3DGS representations through a feed-forward 3DGS method. Leveraging training-free inversion and inpainting techniques, SplatFlow enables seamless 3DGS editing and supports a broad range of 3D tasks-including object editing, novel view synthesis, and camera pose estimation-within a unified framework without requiring additional complex pipelines. We validate SplatFlow's capabilities on the MVImgNet and DL3DV-7K datasets, demonstrating its versatility and effectiveness in various 3D generation, editing, and inpainting-based tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://gohyojun15.github.io/SplatFlow/</p></details> |

While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offers a powerful representation for scene reconstruction, integrating it with open-vocabulary frameworks reveals a key challenge: cross-view granularity inconsistency. This issue, stemming from 2D segmentation methods like SAM, results in inconsistent object segmentations across views (e.g., a "coffee set" segmented as a single entity in one view but as "cup + coffee + spoon" in another). Existing 3DGS-based methods often rely on isolated per-Gaussian feature learning, neglecting the spatial context needed for cohesive object reasoning, leading to fragmented representations. We propose Context-Aware Gaussian Splatting (CAGS), a novel framework that addresses this challenge by incorporating spatial context into 3DGS. CAGS constructs local graphs to propagate contextual features across Gaussians, reducing noise from inconsistent granularity, employs mask-centric contrastive learning to smooth SAM-derived features across views, and leverages a precomputation strategy to reduce computational cost by precomputing neighborhood relationships, enabling efficient training in large-scale scenes. By integrating spatial context, CAGS significantly improves 3D instance segmentation and reduces fragmentation errors on datasets like LERF-OVS and ScanNet, enabling robust language-guided 3D scene understanding.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances have explored two promising directions: multiview generative models that train on 3D consistent datasets but struggle with out-of-distribution generalization, and 3D scene inpainting and completion frameworks that suffer from cross-view inconsistency and suboptimal error handling, as they depend exclusively on depth data or 3D smoothness, which ultimately degrades output quality and computational performance. Building upon these approaches, we present GaussVideoDreamer, which advances generative multimedia approaches by bridging the gap between image, video, and 3D generation, integrating their strengths through two key innovations: (1) A progressive video inpainting strategy that harnesses temporal coherence for improved multiview consistency and faster convergence. (2) A 3D Gaussian Splatting consistency mask to guide the video diffusion with 3D consistent multiview evidence. Our pipeline combines three core components: a geometry-aware initialization protocol, Inconsistency-Aware Gaussian Splatting, and a progressive video inpainting strategy. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves 32% higher LLaVA-IQA scores and at least 2x speedup compared to existing methods while maintaining robust performance across diverse scenes.</p></details> |  |

However, current methods, which predominantly depend on sparse 3D point clouds, exhibit limited generalizability and robustness due to their sensitivity to coordinate variations and the inherent sparsity of the data. By contrast, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) delivers high-fidelity, real-time rendering with minimal computational overhead by representing scenes as dense, continuous distributions. This positions 3DGS as a highly effective approach for capturing fine-grained affordance details and improving recognition accuracy. Nevertheless, its full potential remains largely untapped due to the absence of large-scale, 3DGS-specific affordance datasets. To overcome these limitations, we present 3DAffordSplat, the first large-scale, multi-modal dataset tailored for 3DGS-based affordance reasoning. This dataset includes 23,677 Gaussian instances, 8,354 point cloud instances, and 6,631 manually annotated affordance labels, encompassing 21 object categories and 18 affordance types. Building upon this dataset, we introduce AffordSplatNet, a novel model specifically designed for affordance reasoning using 3DGS representations. AffordSplatNet features an innovative cross-modal structure alignment module that exploits structural consistency priors to align 3D point cloud and 3DGS representations, resulting in enhanced affordance recognition accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the 3DAffordSplat dataset significantly advances affordance learning within the 3DGS domain, while AffordSplatNet consistently outperforms existing methods across both seen and unseen settings, highlighting its robust generalization capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first large-scale 3D Gaussians Affordance Reasoning Benchmark</p></details> |
| **[EDGS: Eliminating Densification for Efficient Convergence of 3DGS](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13204v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting reconstructs scenes by starting from a sparse Structure-from-Motion initialization and iteratively refining under-reconstructed regions. This process is inherently slow, as it requires multiple densification steps where Gaussians are repeatedly split and adjusted, following a lengthy optimization path. Moreover, this incremental approach often leads to suboptimal renderings, particularly in high-frequency regions where detail is critical. We propose a fundamentally different approach: we eliminate densification process with a one-step approximation of scene geometry using triangulated pixels from dense image correspondences. This dense initialization allows us to estimate rough geometry of the scene while preserving rich details from input RGB images, providing each Gaussian with well-informed colors, scales, and positions. As a result, we dramatically shorten the optimization path and remove the need for densification. Unlike traditional methods that rely on sparse keypoints, our dense initialization ensures uniform detail across the scene, even in high-frequency regions where 3DGS and other methods struggle. Moreover, since all splats are initialized in parallel at the start of optimization, we eliminate the need to wait for densification to adjust new Gaussians. Our method not only outperforms speed-optimized models in training efficiency but also achieves higher rendering quality than state-of-the-art approaches, all while using only half the splats of standard 3DGS. It is fully compatible with other 3DGS acceleration techniques, making it a versatile and efficient solution that can be integrated with existing approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[InstanceGaussian: Appearance-Semantic Joint Gaussian Representation for 3D Instance-Level Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19235v2)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D scene understanding has become an essential area of research with applications in autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality. Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful approach, combining explicit modeling with neural adaptability to provide efficient and detailed scene representations. However, three major challenges remain in leveraging 3DGS for scene understanding: 1) an imbalance between appearance and semantics, where dense Gaussian usage for fine-grained texture modeling does not align with the minimal requirements for semantic attributes; 2) inconsistencies between appearance and semantics, as purely appearance-based Gaussians often misrepresent object boundaries; and 3) reliance on top-down instance segmentation methods, which struggle with uneven category distributions, leading to over- or under-segmentation. In this work, we propose InstanceGaussian, a method that jointly learns appearance and semantic features while adaptively aggregating instances. Our contributions include: i) a novel Semantic-Scaffold-GS representation balancing appearance and semantics to improve feature representations and boundary delineation; ii) a progressive appearance-semantic joint training strategy to enhance stability and segmentation accuracy; and iii) a bottom-up, category-agnostic instance aggregation approach that addresses segmentation challenges through farthest point sampling and connected component analysis. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in category-agnostic, open-vocabulary 3D point-level segmentation, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed representation and training strategies.

Unfortunately, these directions require either a large number of small Gaussians or expensive per-pixel post-processing for reconstructing fine details, which negatively impacts rendering performance. To meet the high performance demands of virtual reality (VR) systems, primitive or pixel counts therefore must be kept low, affecting visual quality. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid approach based on foveated rendering as a promising solution that combines the strengths of both point rendering directions regarding performance sweet spots. Analyzing the compatibility with the human visual system, we find that using a low-detailed, few primitive smooth Gaussian representation for the periphery is cheap to compute and meets the perceptual demands of peripheral vision. For the fovea only, we use neural points with a convolutional neural network for the small pixel footprint, which provides sharp, detailed output within the rendering budget. This combination also allows for synergistic method accelerations with point occlusion culling and reducing the demands on the neural network. Our evaluation confirms that our approach increases sharpness and details compared to a standard VR-ready 3DGS configuration, and participants of a user study overwhelmingly preferred our method. Our system meets the necessary performance requirements for real-time VR interactions, ultimately enhancing the user's immersive experience.

The lightweight and differentiable representation of the radiance field using the Gaussian enables rapid and high-quality reconstruction and fast rendering. However, reconstructing objects with high-frequency surface textures (e.g., fine stripes) requires many skinny Gaussian kernels because each Gaussian represents only one color if viewed from one direction. Thus, reconstructing the stripes pattern, for example, requires Gaussians for at least the number of stripes. We present 3D Gabor splatting, which augments the Gaussian kernel to represent spatially high-frequency signals using Gabor noise. The Gabor kernel is a combination of a Gaussian term and spatially fluctuating wave functions, making it suitable for representing spatial high-frequency texture. We demonstrate that our 3D Gabor splatting can reconstruct various high-frequency textures on the objects.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 5 figures, Eurographics 2025 Short Paper</p></details> |

The divide-and-conquer paradigm has enabled large-scale scene reconstruction, but significant challenges remain in scene partitioning, optimization, and merging processes. This paper introduces BlockGaussian, a novel framework incorporating a content-aware scene partition strategy and visibility-aware block optimization to achieve efficient and high-quality large-scale scene reconstruction. Specifically, our approach considers the content-complexity variation across different regions and balances computational load during scene partitioning, enabling efficient scene reconstruction. To tackle the supervision mismatch issue during independent block optimization, we introduce auxiliary points during individual block optimization to align the ground-truth supervision, which enhances the reconstruction quality. Furthermore, we propose a pseudo-view geometry constraint that effectively mitigates rendering degradation caused by airspace floaters during block merging. Extensive experiments on large-scale scenes demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in both reconstruction efficiency and rendering quality, with a 5x speedup in optimization and an average PSNR improvement of 1.21 dB on multiple benchmarks. Notably, BlockGaussian significantly reduces computational requirements, enabling large-scale scene reconstruction on a single 24GB VRAM device.

Achieving high quality typically requires dense sampling of input views, which can lead to frustrating and tedious manual labor. Manually positioning cameras to maintain an optimal desired distribution can be difficult for humans, and if a good distribution is found, it is not easy to replicate. Additionally, the captured data can suffer from motion blur and defocus due to human error. In this paper, we present a lightweight object capture pipeline to reduce the manual workload and standardize the acquisition setup. We use a consumer turntable to carry the object and a tripod to hold the camera. As the turntable rotates, we automatically capture dense samples from various views and lighting conditions; we can repeat this for several camera positions. This way, we can easily capture hundreds of valid images in several minutes without hands-on effort. However, in the object reference frame, the light conditions vary; this is harmful to a standard NVS method like 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) which assumes fixed lighting. We design a neural radiance representation conditioned on light rotations, which addresses this issue and allows relightability as an additional benefit. We demonstrate our pipeline using 3DGS as the underlying framework, achieving competitive quality compared to previous methods with exhaustive acquisition and showcasing its potential for relighting and harmonization tasks.</p></details> |  |

While 3D meshes provide robustness for various modifications, they often yield lower-quality view synthesis compared to 3D Gaussian Splatting, which, in turn, suffers from instability during extensive editing. A straightforward combination of these two representations results in suboptimal performance and fails to meet memory constraints. In this paper, we introduce SplatMesh, a novel fine-grained interactive 3D segmentation and editing algorithm that integrates 3D Gaussian Splat with a precomputed mesh and could adjust the memory request based on the requirement. Specifically, given a mesh, \method simplifies it while considering both color and shape, ensuring it meets memory constraints. Then, SplatMesh aligns Gaussian splats with the simplified mesh by treating each triangle as a new reference point. By segmenting and editing the simplified mesh, we can effectively edit the Gaussian splats as well, which will lead to extensive experiments on real and synthetic datasets, coupled with illustrative visual examples, highlighting the superiority of our approach in terms of representation quality and editing performance.

However, existing methods struggle to achieve a desirable balance among consistency, usability, and computational efficiency in multi-view settings. These limitations are primarily due to unintuitive user interaction in the source view, inefficient multi-view object mask generation, computationally expensive inpainting procedures, and a lack of applicability across different radiance field representations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel pipeline that improves the quality and efficiency of multi-view object mask generation and inpainting. Our method introduces an intuitive region-based interaction mechanism in the source view and eliminates the need for camera poses or extra model training. Our lightweight HoMM module is employed to achieve high-quality multi-view mask propagation with enhanced efficiency. In the inpainting stage, we further reduce computational costs by performing inpainting only on selected key views and propagating the results to other views via homography-based mapping. Our pipeline is compatible with a variety of radiance field frameworks, including NeRF and 3D Gaussian Splatting, demonstrating improved generalizability and practicality in real-world scenarios. Additionally, we present a new 3D multi-object removal dataset with greater object diversity and viewpoint variation than existing datasets. Experiments on public benchmarks and our proposed dataset show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while reducing runtime to one-fifth of that required by leading baselines.</p></details> |  |

In scenarios with rapid motion or low-light conditions, existing RGB-based deblurring methods struggle to model camera pose and radiance changes during exposure, reducing reconstruction accuracy. Event cameras, capturing continuous brightness changes during exposure, can effectively assist in modeling motion blur and improving reconstruction quality. Therefore, we propose Event-driven Bundle Adjusted Deblur Gaussian Splatting (EBAD-Gaussian), which reconstructs sharp 3D Gaussians from event streams and severely blurred images. This method jointly learns the parameters of these Gaussians while recovering camera motion trajectories during exposure time. Specifically, we first construct a blur loss function by synthesizing multiple latent sharp images during the exposure time, minimizing the difference between real and synthesized blurred images. Then we use event stream to supervise the light intensity changes between latent sharp images at any time within the exposure period, supplementing the light intensity dynamic changes lost in RGB images. Furthermore, we optimize the latent sharp images at intermediate exposure times based on the event-based double integral (EDI) prior, applying consistency constraints to enhance the details and texture information of the reconstructed images. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that EBAD-Gaussian can achieve high-quality 3D scene reconstruction under the condition of blurred images and event stream inputs.</p></details> |  |

As the number of training views decreases, the novel view synthesis task degrades to a highly under-determined problem such that existing methods suffer from the notorious overfitting issue. Interestingly, we observe that models with fewer Gaussian primitives exhibit less overfitting under sparse inputs. Inspired by this observation, we propose a Random Dropout Regularization (RDR) to exploit the advantages of low-complexity models to alleviate overfitting. In addition, to remedy the lack of high-frequency details for these models, an Edge-guided Splitting Strategy (ESS) is developed. With these two techniques, our method (termed DropoutGS) provides a simple yet effective plug-in approach to improve the generalization performance of existing 3DGS methods. Extensive experiments show that our DropoutGS produces state-of-the-art performance under sparse views on benchmark datasets including Blender, LLFF, and DTU.

Typically, the initialization is taken from Structure-from-Motion (SfM) algorithms; however, SfM is time-consuming and restricts the application of 3DGS in real-world scenarios and large-scale scene reconstruction. We introduce a constrained optimization method for simultaneous camera pose estimation and 3D reconstruction that does not require SfM support. Core to our approach is decomposing a camera pose into a sequence of camera-to-(device-)center and (device-)center-to-world optimizations. To facilitate, we propose two optimization constraints conditioned to the sensitivity of each parameter group and restricts each parameter's search space. In addition, as we learn the scene geometry directly from the noisy point clouds, we propose geometric constraints to improve the reconstruction quality. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms the existing (multi-modal) 3DGS baseline and methods supplemented by COLMAP on both our collected dataset and two public benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Despite recent advances, there is no comprehensive pipeline yet for bimanual class-agnostic interaction reconstruction from a monocular RGB video, where two hands and an unknown object are interacting with each other. Previous works tackled the limited hand-object interaction case, where object templates are pre-known or only one hand is involved in the interaction. The bimanual interaction reconstruction exhibits severe occlusions introduced by complex interactions between two hands and an object. To solve this, we first introduce BIGS (Bimanual Interaction 3D Gaussian Splatting), a method that reconstructs 3D Gaussians of hands and an unknown object from a monocular video. To robustly obtain object Gaussians avoiding severe occlusions, we leverage prior knowledge of pre-trained diffusion model with score distillation sampling (SDS) loss, to reconstruct unseen object parts. For hand Gaussians, we exploit the 3D priors of hand model (i.e., MANO) and share a single Gaussian for two hands to effectively accumulate hand 3D information, given limited views. To further consider the 3D alignment between hands and objects, we include the interacting-subjects optimization step during Gaussian optimization. Our method achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy on two challenging datasets, in terms of 3D hand pose estimation (MPJPE), 3D object reconstruction (CDh, CDo, F10), and rendering quality (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS), respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |

Panoramic images offer a 360$\times$ 180 field of view (FoV), capturing the entire scene in a single shot. However, panoramic images introduce severe distortion, making it challenging to render 3D Gaussians into 2D distorted equirectangular space directly. Converting equirectangular images to cubemap projections partially alleviates this problem but introduces new challenges, such as projection distortion and discontinuities across cube-face boundaries. To address these limitations, we present a novel framework, named TPGS, to bridge continuous panoramic 3D scene reconstruction with perspective Gaussian splatting. Firstly, we introduce a Transition Plane between adjacent cube faces to enable smoother transitions in splatting directions and mitigate optimization ambiguity in the boundary region. Moreover, an intra-to-inter face optimization strategy is proposed to enhance local details and restore visual consistency across cube-face boundaries. Specifically, we optimize 3D Gaussians within individual cube faces and then fine-tune them in the stitched panoramic space. Additionally, we introduce a spherical sampling technique to eliminate visible stitching seams. Extensive experiments on indoor and outdoor, egocentric, and roaming benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

| **[Depth Estimation Based on 3D Gaussian Splatting Siamese Defocus](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12323v2)** | 2025-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Depth estimation is a fundamental task in 3D geometry. While stereo depth estimation can be achieved through triangulation methods, it is not as straightforward for monocular methods, which require the integration of global and local information. The Depth from Defocus (DFD) method utilizes camera lens models and parameters to recover depth information from blurred images and has been proven to perform well. However, these methods rely on All-In-Focus (AIF) images for depth estimation, which is nearly impossible to obtain in real-world applications. To address this issue, we propose a self-supervised framework based on 3D Gaussian splatting and Siamese networks. By learning the blur levels at different focal distances of the same scene in the focal stack, the framework predicts the defocus map and Circle of Confusion (CoC) from a single defocused image, using the defocus map as input to DepthNet for monocular depth estimation. The 3D Gaussian splatting model renders defocused images using the predicted CoC, and the differences between these and the real defocused images provide additional supervision signals for the Siamese Defocus self-supervised network. This framework has been validated on both artificially synthesized and real blurred datasets. Subsequent quantitative and visualization experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework is highly effective as a DFD method.</p></details> |  |

While differentiable rendering techniques such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) address some of these challenges, their high computational costs make them unsuitable for real-time applications. Additionally, existing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods often focus on photometric consistency, neglecting geometric accuracy and failing to exploit SLAM's dynamic depth and pose updates for scene refinement. We propose a framework integrating dense SLAM with 3DGS for real-time, high-fidelity dense reconstruction. Our approach introduces SLAM-Informed Adaptive Densification, which dynamically updates and densifies the Gaussian model by leveraging dense point clouds from SLAM. Additionally, we incorporate Geometry-Guided Optimization, which combines edge-aware geometric constraints and photometric consistency to jointly optimize the appearance and geometry of the 3DGS scene representation, enabling detailed and accurate SLAM mapping reconstruction. Experiments on the Replica and TUM-RGBD datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art results among monocular systems. Specifically, our method achieves a PSNR of 36.864, SSIM of 0.985, and LPIPS of 0.040 on Replica, representing improvements of 10.7%, 6.4%, and 49.4%, respectively, over the previous SOTA. On TUM-RGBD, our method outperforms the closest baseline by 10.2%, 6.6%, and 34.7% in the same metrics. These results highlight the potential of our framework in bridging the gap between photometric and geometric dense 3D scene representations, paving the way for practical and efficient monocular dense reconstruction.</p></details> |  |

However, multi-granularity interaction remains a challenging task due to the ambiguity of language and degraded quality when it comes to queries upon object components. In this work, we present FMLGS, an approach that supports part-level open-vocabulary query within 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). We propose an efficient pipeline for building and querying consistent object- and part-level semantics based on Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2). We designed a semantic deviation strategy to solve the problem of language ambiguity among object parts, which interpolates the semantic features of fine-grained targets for enriched information. Once trained, we can query both objects and their describable parts using natural language. Comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods prove that our method can not only better locate specified part-level targets, but also achieve first-place performance concerning both speed and accuracy, where FMLGS is 98 x faster than LERF, 4 x faster than LangSplat and 2.5 x faster than LEGaussians. Meanwhile, we further integrate FMLGS as a virtual agent that can interactively navigate through 3D scenes, locate targets, and respond to user demands through a chat interface, which demonstrates the potential of our work to be further expanded and applied in the future.</p></details> |  |
| **[3D Student Splatting and Scooping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10148v4)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) provides a new framework for novel view synthesis, and has spiked a new wave of research in neural rendering and related applications. As 3DGS is becoming a foundational component of many models, any improvement on 3DGS itself can bring huge benefits. To this end, we aim to improve the fundamental paradigm and formulation of 3DGS. We argue that as an unnormalized mixture model, it needs to be neither Gaussians nor splatting. We subsequently propose a new mixture model consisting of flexible Student's t distributions, with both positive (splatting) and negative (scooping) densities. We name our model Student Splatting and Scooping, or SSS. When providing better expressivity, SSS also poses new challenges in learning. Therefore, we also propose a new principled sampling approach for optimization. Through exhaustive evaluation and comparison, across multiple datasets, settings, and metrics, we demonstrate that SSS outperforms existing methods in terms of quality and parameter efficiency, e.g. achieving matching or better quality with similar numbers of components, and obtaining comparable results while reducing the component number by as much as 82%.</p></details> |  |

However, in real-world scenarios, challenges such as motion blur and insufficient illumination often limit the performance of standard frame-based cameras in delivering high-quality images. To address these limitations, we incorporate a transmittance adjustment device at the hardware level, enabling event cameras to capture both motion and exposure events for diverse 3D reconstruction scenarios. Motion events (triggered by camera or object movement) are collected in fast-motion scenarios when the device is inactive, while exposure events (generated through controlled camera exposure) are captured during slower motion to reconstruct grayscale images for high-quality training and optimization of event-based 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Our framework supports three modes: High-Quality Reconstruction using exposure events, Fast Reconstruction relying on motion events, and Balanced Hybrid optimizing with initial exposure events followed by high-speed motion events. On the EventNeRF dataset, we demonstrate that exposure events significantly improve fine detail reconstruction compared to motion events and outperform frame-based cameras under challenging conditions such as low illumination and overexposure. Furthermore, we introduce EME-3D, a real-world 3D dataset with exposure events, motion events, camera calibration parameters, and sparse point clouds. Our method achieves faster and higher-quality reconstruction than event-based NeRF and is more cost-effective than methods combining event and RGB data. E-3DGS sets a new benchmark for event-based 3D reconstruction with robust performance in challenging conditions and lower hardware demands.

However, 3DGS suffers from substantial memory requirements to store the multitude of Gaussians, hindering its practicality. To address this challenge, we introduce GaussianSpa, an optimization-based simplification framework for compact and high-quality 3DGS. Specifically, we formulate the simplification as an optimization problem associated with the 3DGS training. Correspondingly, we propose an efficient "optimizing-sparsifying" solution that alternately solves two independent sub-problems, gradually imposing strong sparsity onto the Gaussians in the training process. Our comprehensive evaluations on various datasets show the superiority of GaussianSpa over existing state-of-the-art approaches. Notably, GaussianSpa achieves an average PSNR improvement of 0.9 dB on the real-world Deep Blending dataset with 10$\times$ fewer Gaussians compared to the vanilla 3DGS.

Previous efforts to accelerate 3DGS rely on dedicated accelerators that require substantial integration overhead and hardware costs. This work proposes an acceleration strategy that leverages the similarities between the 3DGS pipeline and the highly optimized conventional graphics pipeline in modern GPUs. Instead of developing a dedicated accelerator, we enhance existing GPU rasterizer hardware to efficiently support 3DGS operations. Our results demonstrate a 23$\times$ increase in processing speed and a 24$\times$ reduction in energy consumption, with improvements yielding 6$\times$ faster end-to-end runtime for the original 3DGS algorithm and 4$\times$ for the latest efficiency-improved pipeline, achieving 24 FPS and 46 FPS respectively. These enhancements incur only a minimal area overhead of 0.2\% relative to the entire SoC chip area, underscoring the practicality and efficiency of our approach for enabling 3DGS rendering on resource-constrained platforms.</p></details> | DAC 2025 |

Opportunistic CT involves repurposing routine CT images to extract diagnostic information and is an emerging tool for detecting underdiagnosed conditions such as sarcopenia, hepatic steatosis, and ascites. This study utilizes deep learning methods to promote accurate diagnosis and clinical documentation. We analyze 2,674 inpatient CT scans to identify discrepancies between imaging phenotypes (characteristics derived from opportunistic CT scans) and their corresponding documentation in radiology reports and ICD coding. Through our analysis, we find that only 0.5%, 3.2%, and 30.7% of scans diagnosed with sarcopenia, hepatic steatosis, and ascites (respectively) through either opportunistic imaging or radiology reports were ICD-coded. Our findings demonstrate opportunistic CT's potential to enhance diagnostic precision and accuracy of risk adjustment models, offering advancements in precision medicine.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose two novel neural network based orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) receivers performing channel estimation and equalization tasks and directly predicting log likelihood ratios (LLRs) from the received in phase and quadrature phase (IQ) signals. The first network, the Dual Attention Transformer (DAT), employs a state of the art (SOTA) transformer architecture with an attention mechanism. The second network, the Residual Dual Non Local Attention Network (RDNLA), utilizes a parallel residual architecture with a non local attention block. The bit error rate (BER) and block error rate (BLER) performance of various SOTA neural receiver architectures is compared with our proposed methods across different signal to noise ratio (SNR) levels. The simulation results show that DAT and RDNLA outperform both traditional communication systems and existing neural receiver models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Globecom 2025</p></details> |

Although most biometric age estimation studies have focused on facial features and adult subjects, pediatric-specific analysis, particularly of the iris and periocular regions, remains relatively unexplored. This study presents a comparative evaluation of iris and periocular images for estimating the ages of children aged between 4 and 16 years. We utilized a longitudinal dataset comprising more than 21,000 near-infrared (NIR) images, collected from 288 pediatric subjects over eight years using two different imaging sensors. A multi-task deep learning framework was employed to jointly perform age prediction and age-group classification, enabling a systematic exploration of how different convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures, particularly those adapted for non-square ocular inputs, capture the complex variability inherent in pediatric eye images. The results show that periocular models consistently outperform iris-based models, achieving a mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.33 years and an age-group classification accuracy of 83.82%. These results mark the first demonstration that reliable age estimation is feasible from children's ocular images, enabling privacy-preserving age checks in child-centric applications. This work establishes the first longitudinal benchmark for pediatric ocular age estimation, providing a foundation for designing robust, child-focused biometric systems. The developed models proved resilient across different imaging sensors, confirming their potential for real-world deployment. They also achieved inference speeds of less than 10 milliseconds per image on resource-constrained VR headsets, demonstrating their suitability for real-time applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Differential Testing With LLMs For Testing Deep Learning Libraries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07944v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differential testing offers a promising strategy to alleviate the test oracle problem by comparing the test results between alternative implementations. However, existing differential testing techniques for deep learning (DL) libraries are limited by the key challenges of finding alternative implementations (called counterparts) for a given API and subsequently generating diverse test inputs. To address the two challenges, this paper introduces DLLens, an LLM-enhanced differential testing technique for DL libraries. To address the first challenge, DLLens incorporates an LLM-based counterpart synthesis workflow, with the insight that the counterpart of a given DL library API's computation could be successfully synthesized through certain composition and adaptation of the APIs from another DL library. To address the second challenge, DLLens incorporates a static analysis technique that extracts the path constraints from the implementations of a given API and its counterpart to guide diverse test input generation. The extraction is facilitated by LLM's knowledge of the concerned DL library and its upstream libraries. We evaluate DLLens on two popular DL libraries, TensorFlow and PyTorch. Our evaluation shows that DLLens synthesizes counterparts for 1.84 times as many APIs as those found by state-of-the-art techniques on these libraries. Moreover, under the same time budget, DLLens covers 7.23% more branches and detects 1.88 times as many bugs as state-of-the-art techniques on 200 randomly sampled APIs. DLLens has successfully detected 71 bugs in recent TensorFlow and PyTorch libraries. Among them, 59 are confirmed by developers, including 46 confirmed as previously unknown bugs, and 10 of these previously unknown bugs have been fixed in the latest version of TensorFlow and PyTorch.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted by ACM TOSEM.

In this work, we introduce a machine learning framework that combines a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory networks with an Autoencoder to efficiently predict grain growth evolution. Our approach captures both spatial and temporal aspects of grain evolution while encoding high-dimensional grain structure data into a compact latent space for pattern learning, enhanced by a novel composite loss function combining Mean Squared Error, Structural Similarity Index Measurement, and Boundary Preservation to maintain structural integrity of grain boundary topology of the prediction. Results demonstrated that our machine learning approach accelerates grain growth prediction by up to \SI{89}{\times} faster, reducing computation time from \SI{10}{\minute} to approximately \SI{10}{\second} while maintaining high-fidelity predictions. The best model (S-30-30) achieving a structural similarity score of \SI{86.71}{\percent} and mean grain size error of just \SI{0.07}{\percent}. All models accurately captured grain boundary topology, morphology, and size distributions. This approach enables rapid microstructural prediction for applications where conventional simulations are prohibitively time-consuming, potentially accelerating innovation in materials science and manufacturing.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we present a comprehensive deep learning framework for multiscale building segmentation using RGB aerial and satellite imagery with spatial resolutions ranging from 0.4m to 2.7m. We curate a diverse, multi-sensor dataset and introduce feature-augmented inputs by deriving secondary representations including Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Visible Difference Vegetation Index (VDVI), Morphological Building Index (MBI), and Sobel edge filters from RGB channels. These features guide a Res-U-Net architecture in learning complex spatial patterns more effectively. We also propose training policies incorporating layer freezing, cyclical learning rates, and SuperConvergence to reduce training time and resource usage. Evaluated on a held-out WorldView-3 image, our model achieves an overall accuracy of 96.5%, an F1-score of 0.86, and an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.80, outperforming existing RGB-based benchmarks.

Furthermore, a virtual cotton farm was designed and developed as a Robot Operating System (ROS 1) package to deploy the robotic cotton picker in the Gazebo environment for simulating autonomous field navigation. The navigation was assisted by the map coordinates and an RGB-depth camera, while the ROS navigation algorithm utilized a trained YOLOv8n-seg model for instance segmentation. The model achieved a desired mean Average Precision (mAP) of 85.2%, a recall of 88.9%, and a precision of 93.0% for scene segmentation. The developed ROS navigation packages enabled our robotic cotton-picking system to autonomously navigate through the cotton field using map-based and GPS-based approaches, visually aided by a deep learning-based perception system. The GPS-based navigation approach achieved a 100% completion rate (CR) with a threshold of 5 x 10^-6 degrees, while the map-based navigation approach attained a 96.7% CR with a threshold of 0.25 m.

However, a gap remains between the ring hardware and reliable methods for estimating cardiovascular parameters, partly due to the lack of publicly available datasets and standardized analysis tools. In this work, we present $\tau$-Ring, the first open-source ring-based dataset designed for cardiovascular physiological sensing. The dataset comprises photoplethysmography signals (infrared and red channels) and 3-axis accelerometer data collected from two rings (reflective and transmissive optical paths), with 28.21 hours of raw data from 34 subjects across seven activities. $\tau$-Ring encompasses both stationary and motion scenarios, as well as stimulus-evoked abnormal physiological states, annotated with four ground-truth labels: heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and blood pressure. Using our proposed RingTool toolkit, we evaluated three widely-used physics-based methods and four cutting-edge deep learning approaches. Our results show superior performance compared to commercial rings, achieving best MAE values of 5.18 BPM for heart rate, 2.98 BPM for respiratory rate, 3.22\% for oxygen saturation, and 13.33/7.56 mmHg for systolic/diastolic blood pressure estimation. The open-sourced dataset and toolkit aim to foster further research and community-driven advances in ring-based cardiovascular health sensing.</p></details> |  |

Whilst lung and airway cell atlases have been attempted, there is a lack of fine-grained morphological atlases that are clinically deployable. In this work, we introduce AirMorph, a robust, end-to-end deep learning pipeline enabling fully automatic and comprehensive airway anatomical labeling at lobar, segmental, and subsegmental resolutions that can be used to create digital atlases of the lung. Evaluated across large-scale multi-center datasets comprising diverse pulmonary conditions, the AirMorph consistently outperformed existing segmentation and labeling methods in terms of accuracy, topological consistency, and completeness. To simplify clinical interpretation, we further introduce a compact anatomical signature quantifying critical morphological airway features, including stenosis, ectasia, tortuosity, divergence, length, and complexity. When applied to various pulmonary diseases such as pulmonary fibrosis, emphysema, atelectasis, consolidation, and reticular opacities, it demonstrates strong discriminative power, revealing disease-specific morphological patterns with high interpretability and explainability. Additionally, AirMorph supports efficient automated branching pattern analysis, potentially enhancing bronchoscopic navigation planning and procedural safety, offering a valuable clinical tool for improved diagnosis, targeted treatment, and personalized patient care.</p></details> | Under Review |

However, its success largely depends on large-scale, high-quality labeled datasets, which are costly and time-consuming to obtain due to the need for expert annotation. To mitigate this limitation, label-efficient deep learning methods have emerged to improve model performance under limited supervision by leveraging labeled, unlabeled, and weakly labeled data. In this survey, we systematically review over 350 peer-reviewed studies and present a comprehensive taxonomy of label-efficient learning methods in MIA. These methods are categorized into four labeling paradigms: no label, insufficient label, inexact label, and label refinement. For each category, we analyze representative techniques across imaging modalities and clinical applications, highlighting shared methodological principles and task-specific adaptations. We also examine the growing role of health foundation models (HFMs) in enabling label-efficient learning through large-scale pre-training and transfer learning, enhancing the use of limited annotations in downstream tasks. Finally, we identify current challenges and future directions to facilitate the translation of label-efficient learning from research promise to everyday clinical care.</p></details> | Under Review |

While this method has saved many lives, human error remains a significant challenge, as missing a polyp could have fatal consequences for the patient. Deep learning (DL) polyp detectors offer a promising solution. However, existing DL polyp detectors often mistake white light reflections from the endoscope for polyps, which can lead to false positives.To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose a novel data augmentation approach that artificially adds more white light reflections to create harder training scenarios. Specifically, we first generate a bank of artificial lights using the training dataset. Then we find the regions of the training images that we should not add these artificial lights on. Finally, we propose a sliding window method to add the artificial light to the areas that fit of the training images, resulting in augmented images. By providing the model with more opportunities to make mistakes, we hypothesize that it will also have more chances to learn from those mistakes, ultimately improving its performance in polyp detection. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our new data augmentation method.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 Figures, paper accepted by the ISBI (International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging) 2025 Conference</p></details> |

We propose a method that improves the performance of deep learning-based monocular 3D human pose estimation models by using multiview data only during training, but not during inference. We introduce a novel loss function, consistency loss, which operates on two synchronized views. This approach is simpler than previous models that require 3D ground truth or intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters. Our consistency loss penalizes differences in two pose sequences after rigid alignment. We also demonstrate that our consistency loss substantially improves performance for fine-tuning without requiring 3D data. Furthermore, we show that using our consistency loss can yield state-of-the-art performance when training models from scratch in a semi-supervised manner. Our findings provide a simple way to capture new data, e.g in a new domain. This data can be added using off-the-shelf cameras with no calibration requirements. We make all our code and data publicly available.</p></details> |  |

The use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for tumor detection has shown promise, but existing models often suffer from overparameterization, which limits their performance gains. In this study, fuzzy sigmoid convolution (FSC) is introduced along with two additional modules: top-of-the-funnel and middle-of-the-funnel. The proposed methodology significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters without compromising classification accuracy. A novel convolutional operator is central to this approach, effectively dilating the receptive field while preserving input data integrity. This enables efficient feature map reduction and enhances the model's tumor detection capability. In the FSC-based model, fuzzy sigmoid activation functions are incorporated within convolutional layers to improve feature extraction and classification. The inclusion of fuzzy logic into the architecture improves its adaptability and robustness. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance and efficiency of the proposed model. The FSC-based architecture achieved classification accuracies of 99.17%, 99.75%, and 99.89% on three different datasets. The model employs 100 times fewer parameters than large-scale transfer learning architectures, highlighting its computational efficiency and suitability for detecting brain tumors early.

We propose Stochastic Variational Propagation (SVP), a scalable alternative that reframes training as hierarchical variational inference. SVP treats layer activations as latent variables and optimizes local Evidence Lower Bounds (ELBOs), enabling independent, local updates while preserving global coherence. However, directly applying KL divergence in layer-wise ELBOs risks inter-layer's representation collapse due to excessive compression. To prevent this, SVP projects activations into low-dimensional spaces via fixed random matrices, ensuring information preservation and representational diversity. Combined with a feature alignment loss for inter-layer consistency, SVP achieves competitive accuracy with BP across diverse architectures (MLPs, CNNs, Transformers) and datasets (MNIST to ImageNet), reduces memory usage by up to 4x, and significantly improves scalability. More broadly, SVP introduces a probabilistic perspective to deep representation learning, opening pathways toward more modular and interpretable neural network design.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures |

Here we introduce "Not Another Imputation Method" (NAIM), a novel transformer-based model specifically designed to address this issue without the need for traditional imputation techniques. NAIM's ability to avoid the necessity of imputing missing values and to effectively learn from available data relies on two main techniques: the use of feature-specific embeddings to encode both categorical and numerical features also handling missing inputs; the modification of the masked self-attention mechanism to completely mask out the contributions of missing data. Additionally, a novel regularization technique is introduced to enhance the model's generalization capability from incomplete data. We extensively evaluated NAIM on 5 publicly available tabular datasets, demonstrating its superior performance over 6 state-of-the-art machine learning models and 5 deep learning models, each paired with 3 different imputation techniques when necessary. The results highlight the efficacy of NAIM in improving predictive performance and resilience in the presence of missing data. To facilitate further research and practical application in handling missing data without traditional imputation methods, we made the code for NAIM available at https://github.com/cosbidev/NAIM.</p></details> |  |

In this research, our aim is to offer actionable insights into the utility of deep PDE solvers for practical option pricing implementation. Through comparative experiments in both the Black--Scholes and the Heston model, we assess the empirical performance of two neural network algorithms to solve PDEs: the Deep Galerkin Method and the Time Deep Gradient Flow method (TDGF). We determine their empirical convergence rates and training time as functions of (i) the number of sampling stages, (ii) the number of samples, (iii) the number of layers, and (iv) the number of nodes per layer.

Through the use of sensors for input and actuators for action, these systems can learn and adapt based on real-world feedback, allowing them to perform tasks effectively in dynamic and unpredictable environments. As techniques such as deep learning (DL), reinforcement learning (RL), and large language models (LLMs) mature, embodied AI has become a leading field in both academia and industry, with applications spanning robotics, healthcare, transportation, and manufacturing. However, most research has focused on single-agent systems that often assume static, closed environments, whereas real-world embodied AI must navigate far more complex scenarios. In such settings, agents must not only interact with their surroundings but also collaborate with other agents, necessitating sophisticated mechanisms for adaptation, real-time learning, and collaborative problem-solving. Despite increasing interest in multi-agent systems, existing research remains narrow in scope, often relying on simplified models that fail to capture the full complexity of dynamic, open environments for multi-agent embodied AI. Moreover, no comprehensive survey has systematically reviewed the advancements in this area. As embodied AI rapidly evolves, it is crucial to deepen our understanding of multi-agent embodied AI to address the challenges presented by real-world applications. To fill this gap and foster further development in the field, this paper reviews the current state of research, analyzes key contributions, and identifies challenges and future directions, providing insights to guide innovation and progress in this field.</p></details> |  |

Our method processes a floor map with additional features of the walls to generate indoor pathloss maps. We systematically evaluate the effects of architectural choices, data augmentation strategies, and feature engineering techniques.

One such task is disparity estimation, estimating the disparity between matching pixels in stereo image pairs, which is crucial for safety-critical applications like medical surgeries and autonomous navigation. However, DL-based disparity estimation methods are highly susceptible to distribution shifts and adversarial attacks, raising concerns about their reliability and generalization. Despite these concerns, a standardized benchmark for evaluating the robustness of disparity estimation methods remains absent, hindering progress in the field. To address this gap, we introduce DispBench, a comprehensive benchmarking tool for systematically assessing the reliability of disparity estimation methods. DispBench evaluates robustness against synthetic image corruptions such as adversarial attacks and out-of-distribution shifts caused by 2D Common Corruptions across multiple datasets and diverse corruption scenarios. We conduct the most extensive performance and robustness analysis of disparity estimation methods to date, uncovering key correlations between accuracy, reliability, and generalization.

During heavy rainfall, the interference from raindrops can adversely affect the quality of LiDAR point clouds, resulting in, for instance, inaccurate point measurements. This, in turn, can potentially lead to safety concerns if autonomous driving systems are not weather-aware, i.e., if they are unable to discern such changes. In this study, we release a new, large-scale, multi-modal emulated rain dataset, REHEARSE-3D, to promote research advancements in 3D point cloud de-raining. Distinct from the most relevant competitors, our dataset is unique in several respects. First, it is the largest point-wise annotated dataset, and second, it is the only one with high-resolution LiDAR data (LiDAR-256) enriched with 4D Radar point clouds logged in both daytime and nighttime conditions in a controlled weather environment. Furthermore, REHEARSE-3D involves rain-characteristic information, which is of significant value not only for sensor noise modeling but also for analyzing the impact of weather at a point level. Leveraging REHEARSE-3D, we benchmark raindrop detection and removal in fused LiDAR and 4D Radar point clouds. Our comprehensive study further evaluates the performance of various statistical and deep-learning models. Upon publication, the dataset and benchmark models will be made publicly available at: https://sporsho.github.io/REHEARSE3D.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we propose WaveSleepNet, an interpretable neural network for sleep staging that reasons in a similar way to sleep experts. In this network, we utilize the latent space representations generated during training to identify characteristic wave prototypes corresponding to different sleep stages. The feature representation of an input signal is segmented into patches within the latent space, each of which is compared against the learned wave prototypes. The proximity between these patches and the wave prototypes is quantified through scores, indicating the prototypes' presence and relative proportion within the signal. The scores are served as the decision-making criteria for final sleep staging. During training, an ensemble of loss functions is employed for the prototypes' diversity and robustness. Furthermore, the learned wave prototypes are visualized by analysing occlusion sensitivity. The efficacy of WaveSleepNet is validated across three public datasets, achieving sleep staging performance that are on par with the state-of-the-art models when several WaveSleepNets are combine into a larger network. A detailed case study examined the decision-making process of the WaveSleepNet which aligns closely with American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) manual guidelines. Another case study systematically explained the misidentified reason behind each sleep stage. WaveSleepNet's transparent process provides specialists with direct access to the physiological significance of its criteria, allowing for future adaptation or enrichment by sleep experts.</p></details> | 17 pages, 6 figures |

The identification and segmentation of these lesions are crucial for understanding AD progression but remain challenging due to the lack of large-scale annotated datasets and the impact of staining variations on automated image analysis. Deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool for pathology image segmentation; however, model performance is significantly influenced by variations in staining characteristics, necessitating effective stain normalization and enhancement techniques. In this study, we address these challenges by introducing an open-source dataset (ADNP-15) of neuritic plaques (i.e., amyloid deposits combined with a crown of dystrophic tau-positive neurites) in human brain whole slide images. We establish a comprehensive benchmark by evaluating five widely adopted deep learning models across four stain normalization techniques, providing deeper insights into their influence on neuritic plaque segmentation. Additionally, we propose a novel image enhancement method that improves segmentation accuracy, particularly in complex tissue structures, by enhancing structural details and mitigating staining inconsistencies. Our experimental results demonstrate that this enhancement strategy significantly boosts model generalization and segmentation accuracy. All datasets and code are open-source, ensuring transparency and reproducibility while enabling further advancements in the field.</p></details> |  |

However, human global motions are still challenging to be reconstructed by IMUs. This paper aims to solve this problem by involving physics. It proposes a physical optimization scheme based on multiple contacts to enable physically plausible translation estimation in the full 3D space where the z-directional motion is usually challenging for previous works. It also considers gravity in local pose estimation which well constrains human global orientations and refines local pose estimation in a joint estimation manner. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves more accurate motion capture for both local poses and global motions. Furthermore, by deeply integrating physics, we can also estimate 3D contact, contact forces, joint torques, and interacting proxy surfaces.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGGRAPH 2025.

While some studies manually assess these anomalies and describe the ribs qualitatively, this study aims to automate thoracolumbar stump rib detection and analyze their morphology quantitatively. To this end, we train a high-resolution deep-learning model for rib segmentation and show significant improvements compared to existing models (Dice score 0.997 vs. 0.779, p-value < 0.01). In addition, we use an iterative algorithm and piece-wise linear interpolation to assess the length of the ribs, showing a success rate of 98.2%. When analyzing morphological features, we show that stump ribs articulate more posteriorly at the vertebrae (-19.2 +- 3.8 vs -13.8 +- 2.5, p-value < 0.01), are thinner (260.6 +- 103.4 vs. 563.6 +- 127.1, p-value < 0.01), and are oriented more downwards and sideways within the first centimeters in contrast to full-length ribs. We show that with partially visible ribs, these features can achieve an F1-score of 0.84 in differentiating stump ribs from regular ones. We publish the model weights and masks for public use.</p></details> |  |

Despite their wide applicability, processing multi-channel audio signals from microphone arrays in SSL involves computationally intensive matrix operations, which can hinder efficient deployment on Central Processing Units (CPUs), particularly in embedded systems with limited CPU resources. This paper introduces a GPU-based implementation of SSL for robot audition, utilizing the Generalized Singular Value Decomposition-based Multiple Signal Classification (GSVD-MUSIC), a noise-robust algorithm, within the HARK platform, an open-source software suite. For a 60-channel microphone array, the proposed implementation achieves significant performance improvements. On the Jetson AGX Orin, an embedded device powered by an NVIDIA GPU and ARM Cortex-A78AE v8.2 64-bit CPUs, we observe speedups of 5648.7x for GSVD calculations and 10.7x for the SSL module, while speedups of 4245.1x for GSVD calculation and 17.3x for the entire SSL module on a server configured with an NVIDIA A100 GPU and AMD EPYC 7352 CPUs, making real-time processing feasible for large-scale microphone arrays and providing ample capacity for real-time processing of potential subsequent machine learning or deep learning tasks.</p></details> | 6 pages, 2 figures |

However, achieving safe autonomous navigation and high-level tasks such as exploration and surveillance with these tiny platforms is extremely challenging due to their limited resources. This work focuses on enabling the safe and autonomous flight of a pocket-size, 30-gram platform called Crazyflie 2.1 in a partially known environment. We propose a novel AI-aided, vision-based reactive planning method for obstacle avoidance under the ambit of Integrated Sensing, Computing and Communication paradigm. We deal with the constraints of the nano-drone by splitting the navigation task into two parts: a deep learning-based object detector runs on the edge (external hardware) while the planning algorithm is executed onboard. The results show the ability to command the drone at $\sim8$ frames-per-second and a model performance reaching a COCO mean-average-precision of $60.8$. Field experiments demonstrate the feasibility of the solution with the drone flying at a top speed of $1$ m/s while steering away from an obstacle placed in an unknown position and reaching the target destination. The outcome highlights the compatibility of the communication delay and the model performance with the requirements of the real-time navigation task. We provide a feasible alternative to a fully onboard implementation that can be extended to autonomous exploration with nano-drones.</p></details> | <details><summary>in DC...</summary><p>in DCOSS-IoT 2025, Wi-DroIT 2025</p></details> |

Nowadays, existing deep learning methods for natural products research primarily rely on supervised learning approaches designed for specific downstream tasks. However, such one-model-for-a-task paradigm often lacks generalizability and leaves significant room for performance improvement. Additionally, existing molecular characterization methods are not well-suited for the unique tasks associated with natural products. To address these limitations, we have pre-trained a foundation model for natural products based on their unique properties. Our approach employs a novel pretraining strategy that is especially tailored to natural products. By incorporating contrastive learning and masked graph learning objectives, we emphasize evolutional information from molecular scaffolds while capturing side-chain information. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in various downstream tasks related to natural product mining and drug discovery. We first compare taxonomy classification with synthesized molecule-focused baselines to demonstrate that current models are inadequate for understanding natural synthesis. Furthermore, by diving into a fine-grained analysis at both the gene and microbial levels, NaFM demonstrates the ability to capture evolutionary information. Eventually, our method is experimented with virtual screening, illustrating informative natural product representations that can lead to more effective identification of potential drug candidates.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Depth Maps and Attention Mechanisms for Enhanced Image Inpainting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00735v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing deep learning-based image inpainting methods typically rely on convolutional networks with RGB images to reconstruct images. However, relying exclusively on RGB images may neglect important depth information, which plays a critical role in understanding the spatial and structural context of a scene. Just as human vision leverages stereo cues to perceive depth, incorporating depth maps into the inpainting process can enhance the model's ability to reconstruct images with greater accuracy and contextual awareness. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that incorporates both RGB and depth images for enhanced image inpainting. Our models employ a dual encoder architecture, where one encoder processes the RGB image and the other handles the depth image. The encoded features from both encoders are then fused in the decoder using an attention mechanism, effectively integrating the RGB and depth representations. We use two different masking strategies, line and square, to test the robustness of the model under different types of occlusions. To further analyze the effectiveness of our approach, we use Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) visualizations to examine the regions of interest the model focuses on during inpainting. We show that incorporating depth information alongside the RGB image significantly improves the reconstruction quality. Through both qualitative and quantitative comparisons, we demonstrate that the depth-integrated model outperforms the baseline, with attention mechanisms further enhancing inpainting performance, as evidenced by multiple evaluation metrics and visualization.</p></details> |  |

Theoretically, we explore the connections between the RUOT and Schr\"odinger bridge problem and discuss the key challenges and potential solutions. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated with a synthetic gene regulatory network, high-dimensional Gaussian Mixture Model, and single-cell RNA-seq data from blood development.

While such technologies offer benefits such as democratizing artistic creation, they also pose challenges in misinformation, digital forgery, and authenticity verification. Additionally, the uncredited use of AI-generated images in media and marketing has sparked significant backlash from online communities. In response to this, we introduce DejAIvu, a Chrome Web extension that combines real-time AI-generated image detection with saliency-based explainability while users browse the web.

Nonetheless, PPFL is vulnerable to data poisoning attacks due to the distributed training nature of clients. Existing solutions have struggled to improve the performance of cross-silo PPFL in poisoned Non-IID data. To address the issues, this paper proposes a privacy-preserving federated prototype learning framework, named PPFPL, which enhances the cross-silo FL performance in poisoned Non-IID data while effectively resisting data poisoning attacks. Specifically, we adopt prototypes as client-submitted model updates to eliminate the impact of tampered data distribution on federated learning. Moreover, we utilize two servers to achieve Byzantine-robust aggregation by secure aggregation protocol, which greatly reduces the impact of malicious clients. Theoretical analyses confirm the convergence of PPFPL, and experimental results on publicly available datasets show that PPFPL is effective for resisting data poisoning attacks with Non-IID conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fair Uncertainty Quantification for Depression Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04931v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trustworthy depression prediction based on deep learning, incorporating both predictive reliability and algorithmic fairness across diverse demographic groups, is crucial for clinical application. Recently, achieving reliable depression predictions through uncertainty quantification has attracted increasing attention. However, few studies have focused on the fairness of uncertainty quantification (UQ) in depression prediction. In this work, we investigate the algorithmic fairness of UQ, namely Equal Opportunity Coverage (EOC) fairness, and propose Fair Uncertainty Quantification (FUQ) for depression prediction. FUQ pursues reliable and fair depression predictions through group-based analysis. Specifically, we first group all the participants by different sensitive attributes and leverage conformal prediction to quantify uncertainty within each demographic group, which provides a theoretically guaranteed and valid way to quantify uncertainty for depression prediction and facilitates the investigation of fairness across different demographic groups. Furthermore, we propose a fairness-aware optimization strategy that formulates fairness as a constrained optimization problem under EOC constraints. This enables the model to preserve predictive reliability while adapting to the heterogeneous uncertainty levels across demographic groups, thereby achieving optimal fairness. Through extensive evaluations on several visual and audio depression datasets, our approach demonstrates its effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

In light of these disadvantages, we develop PASSAT, a novel Physics-ASSisted And Topology-informed deep learning model for weather prediction. PASSAT attributes the weather evolution to two key factors: (i) the advection process that can be characterized by the advection equation and the Navier-Stokes equation; (ii) the Earth-atmosphere interaction that is difficult to both model and calculate. PASSAT also takes the topology of the Earth's surface into consideration, other than simply treating it as a plane. With these considerations, PASSAT numerically solves the advection equation and the Navier-Stokes equation on the spherical manifold, utilizes a spherical graph neural network to capture the Earth-atmosphere interaction, and generates the initial velocity fields that are critical to solving the advection equation from the same spherical graph neural network. In the $5.625^\circ$-resolution ERA5 data set, PASSAT outperforms both the state-of-the-art deep learning-based weather prediction models and the operational numerical weather prediction model IFS T42.

| **[Semi-supervised Underwater Image Enhancement Using A Physics-Aware Triple-Stream Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11470v5)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Underwater images normally suffer from degradation due to the transmission medium of water bodies. Both traditional prior-based approaches and deep learning-based methods have been used to address this problem. However, the inflexible assumption of the former often impairs their effectiveness in handling diverse underwater scenes, while the generalization of the latter to unseen images is usually weakened by insufficient data. In this study, we leverage both the physics-based Image Formation Model (IFM) and deep learning techniques for Underwater Image Enhancement (UIE). To this end, we propose a novel Physics-Aware Triple-Stream Underwater Image Enhancement Network, i.e., PATS-UIENet, which comprises a Direct Signal Transmission Estimation Steam (D-Stream), a Backscatter Signal Transmission Estimation Steam (B-Stream) and an Ambient Light Estimation Stream (A-Stream). This network fulfills the UIE task by explicitly estimating the degradation parameters of a revised IFM. We also adopt an IFM-inspired semi-supervised learning framework, which exploits both the labeled and unlabeled images, to address the issue of insufficient data. To our knowledge, such a physics-aware deep network and the IFM-inspired semi-supervised learning framework have not been used for the UIE task before. Our method performs better than, or at least comparably to, sixteen baselines across six testing sets in the degradation estimation and UIE tasks. These promising results should be due to the fact that the proposed method can not only model the degradation but also learn the characteristics of diverse underwater scenes.</p></details> | 13 pages, 10 figures |

We introduce IntelliCardiac, a comprehensive, web-based medical image processing platform for the automatic segmentation of 4D cardiac images and disease classification, utilizing an AI model trained on the publicly accessible ACDC dataset. The system, intended for patients, cardiologists, and healthcare professionals, offers an intuitive interface and uses deep learning models to identify essential heart structures and categorize cardiac diseases. The system supports analysis of both the right and left ventricles as well as myocardium, and then classifies patient's cardiac images into five diagnostic categories: dilated cardiomyopathy, myocardial infarction, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, right ventricular abnormality, and no disease. IntelliCardiac combines a deep learning-based segmentation model with a two-step classification pipeline. The segmentation module gains an overall accuracy of 92.6%. The classification module, trained on characteristics taken from segmented heart structures, achieves 98% accuracy in five categories. These results exceed the performance of the existing state-of-the-art methods that integrate both segmentation and classification models. IntelliCardiac, which supports real-time visualization, workflow integration, and AI-assisted diagnostics, has great potential as a scalable, accurate tool for clinical decision assistance in cardiac imaging and diagnosis.</p></details> |  |

| **[DyCE: Dynamically Configurable Exiting for Deep Learning Compression and Real-time Scaling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01695v3)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional deep learning (DL) model compression and scaling methods focus on altering the model's components, impacting the results across all samples uniformly. However, since samples vary in difficulty, a dynamic model that adapts computation based on sample complexity offers a novel perspective for compression and scaling. Despite this potential, existing dynamic models are typically monolithic and model-specific, limiting their generalizability as broad compression and scaling methods. Additionally, most deployed DL systems are fixed, unable to adjust their scale once deployed and, therefore, cannot adapt to the varying real-time demands. This paper introduces DyCE, a dynamically configurable system that can adjust the performance-complexity trade-off of a DL model at runtime without requiring re-initialization or redeployment on inference hardware. DyCE achieves this by adding small exit networks to intermediate layers of the original model, allowing computation to terminate early if acceptable results are obtained. DyCE also decouples the design of an efficient dynamic model, facilitating easy adaptation to new base models and potential general use in compression and scaling. We also propose methods for generating optimized configurations and determining the types and positions of exit networks to achieve desired performance and complexity trade-offs. By enabling simple configuration switching, DyCE provides fine-grained performance tuning in real-time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DyCE through image classification tasks using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). DyCE significantly reduces computational complexity by 23.5% for ResNet152 and 25.9% for ConvNextv2-tiny on ImageNet, with accuracy reductions of less than 0.5%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Integrated Image Reconstruction and Target Recognition based on Deep Learning Technique](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04836v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computational microwave imaging (CMI) has gained attention as an alternative technique for conventional microwave imaging techniques, addressing their limitations such as hardware-intensive physical layer and slow data collection acquisition speed to name a few. Despite these advantages, CMI still encounters notable computational bottlenecks, especially during the image reconstruction stage. In this setting, both image recovery and object classification present significant processing demands. To address these challenges, our previous work introduced ClassiGAN, which is a generative deep learning model designed to simultaneously reconstruct images and classify targets using only back-scattered signals. In this study, we build upon that framework by incorporating attention gate modules into ClassiGAN. These modules are intended to refine feature extraction and improve the identification of relevant information. By dynamically focusing on important features and suppressing irrelevant ones, the attention mechanism enhances the overall model performance. The proposed architecture, named Att-ClassiGAN, significantly reduces the reconstruction time compared to traditional CMI approaches. Furthermore, it outperforms current advanced methods, delivering improved Normalized Mean Squared Error (NMSE), higher Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), and better classification outcomes for the reconstructed targets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to The 2025 15th IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Computing (ICSPCC 2025)</p></details> |
| **[An automated end-to-end deep learning-based framework for lung cancer diagnosis by detecting and classifying the lung nodules](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00046v2)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, and early detection is crucial for improving patient outcomes. Nevertheless, early diagnosis of cancer is a major challenge, particularly in low-resource settings where access to medical resources and trained radiologists is limited. The objective of this study is to propose an automated end-to-end deep learning-based framework for the early detection and classification of lung nodules, specifically for low-resource settings. The proposed framework consists of three stages: lung segmentation using a modified 3D U-Net named 3D Res-U-Net, nodule detection using YOLO-v5, and classification with a Vision Transformer-based architecture. We evaluated the proposed framework on a publicly available dataset, LUNA16. The proposed framework's performance was measured using the respective domain's evaluation matrices. The proposed framework achieved a 98.82% lung segmentation dice score while detecting the lung nodule with 0.76 mAP@50 from the segmented lung, at a low false-positive rate. The performance of both networks of the proposed framework was compared with other studies and found to outperform them regarding segmentation and detection accuracy. Additionally, our proposed Vision transformer network obtained an accuracy of 93.57%, which is 1.21% higher than the state-of-the-art networks. Our proposed end-to-end deep learning-based framework can effectively segment lungs, and detect and classify lung nodules, specifically in low-resource settings with limited access to radiologists. The proposed framework outperforms existing studies regarding all the respective evaluation metrics. The proposed framework can potentially improve the accuracy and efficiency of lung cancer screening in low-resource settings, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes.</p></details> |  |

Collecting diverse real-world data for testing the robustness of DL models is resource-intensive, making synthetic corruptions an attractive alternative for robustness testing. However, are synthetic corruptions a reliable proxy for real-world corruptions? To answer this, we conduct the largest benchmarking study on semantic segmentation models, comparing performance on real-world corruptions and synthetic corruptions datasets. Our results reveal a strong correlation in mean performance, supporting the use of synthetic corruptions for robustness evaluation. We further analyze corruption-specific correlations, providing key insights to understand when synthetic corruptions succeed in representing real-world corruptions.

| **[Deep learning-based ecological analysis of camera trap images is impacted by training data quality and quantity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14348v2)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large image collections generated from camera traps offer valuable insights into species richness, occupancy, and activity patterns, significantly aiding biodiversity monitoring. However, the manual processing of these datasets is time-consuming, hindering analytical processes. To address this, deep neural networks have been adopted to automate image labelling, but the impact of classification error on ecological metrics remains unclear. Here, we analyse data from camera trap collections in an African savannah (82,300 images, 47 species) and an Asian sub-tropical dry forest (40,308 images, 29 species) to compare ecological metrics derived from expert-generated species identifications with those generated by deep learning classification models. We specifically assess the impact of deep learning model architecture, the proportion of label noise in the training data, and the size of the training dataset on three ecological metrics: species richness, occupancy, and activity patterns. Overall, ecological metrics derived from deep neural networks closely match those calculated from expert labels and remain robust to manipulations in the training pipeline. We found that the choice of deep learning model architecture does not impact ecological metrics, and ecological metrics related to the overall community (species richness, community occupancy) were resilient to up to 10% noise in the training dataset and a 50% reduction in the training dataset size. However, we caution that less common species are disproportionately affected by a reduction in deep neural network accuracy, and this has consequences for species-specific metrics (occupancy, diel activity patterns). To ensure the reliability of their findings, practitioners should prioritize creating large, clean training sets with balanced representation across species over exploring numerous deep learning model architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>*equa...</summary><p>*equally contributing authors</p></details> |
| **[TLOB: A Novel Transformer Model with Dual Attention for Price Trend Prediction with Limit Order Book Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15757v3)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Price Trend Prediction (PTP) based on Limit Order Book (LOB) data is a fundamental challenge in financial markets. Despite advances in deep learning, existing models fail to generalize across different market conditions and assets. Surprisingly, by adapting a simple MLP-based architecture to LOB, we show that we surpass SoTA performance; thus, challenging the necessity of complex architectures. Unlike past work that shows robustness issues, we propose TLOB, a transformer-based model that uses a dual attention mechanism to capture spatial and temporal dependencies in LOB data. This allows it to adaptively focus on the market microstructure, making it particularly effective for longer-horizon predictions and volatile market conditions. We also introduce a new labeling method that improves on previous ones, removing the horizon bias. We evaluate TLOB's effectiveness across four horizons, using the established FI-2010 benchmark, a NASDAQ and a Bitcoin dataset. TLOB outperforms SoTA methods in every dataset and horizon. Additionally, we empirically show how stock price predictability has declined over time, -6.68 in F1-score, highlighting the growing market efficiency. Predictability must be considered in relation to transaction costs, so we experimented with defining trends using an average spread, reflecting the primary transaction cost. The resulting performance deterioration underscores the complexity of translating trend classification into profitable trading strategies. We argue that our work provides new insights into the evolving landscape of stock price trend prediction and sets a strong foundation for future advancements in financial AI. We release the code at https://github.com/LeonardoBerti00/TLOB.</p></details> |  |
| **[Texture Image Synthesis Using Spatial GAN Based on Vision Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01842v2)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Texture synthesis is a fundamental task in computer vision, whose goal is to generate visually realistic and structurally coherent textures for a wide range of applications, from graphics to scientific simulations. While traditional methods like tiling and patch-based techniques often struggle with complex textures, recent advancements in deep learning have transformed this field. In this paper, we propose ViT-SGAN, a new hybrid model that fuses Vision Transformers (ViTs) with a Spatial Generative Adversarial Network (SGAN) to address the limitations of previous methods. By incorporating specialized texture descriptors such as mean-variance (mu, sigma) and textons into the self-attention mechanism of ViTs, our model achieves superior texture synthesis. This approach enhances the model's capacity to capture complex spatial dependencies, leading to improved texture quality that is superior to state-of-the-art models, especially for regular and irregular textures. Comparison experiments with metrics such as FID, IS, SSIM, and LPIPS demonstrate the substantial improvement of ViT-SGAN, which underlines its efficiency in generating diverse realistic textures.</p></details> | Preprint |

While magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers a non-invasive assessment, accurately segmenting cirrhotic livers presents substantial challenges due to morphological alterations and heterogeneous signal characteristics. Deep learning approaches show promise for automating these tasks, but progress has been limited by the absence of large-scale, annotated datasets. Here, we present CirrMRI600+, the first comprehensive dataset comprising 628 high-resolution abdominal MRI scans (310 T1-weighted and 318 T2-weighted sequences, totaling nearly 40,000 annotated slices) with expert-validated segmentation labels for cirrhotic livers. The dataset includes demographic information, clinical parameters, and histopathological validation where available. Additionally, we provide benchmark results from 11 state-of-the-art deep learning experiments to establish performance standards. CirrMRI600+ enables the development and validation of advanced computational methods for cirrhotic liver analysis, potentially accelerating progress toward automated Cirrhosis visual staging and personalized treatment planning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Compare Hardware Designs for High-Level Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13138v2)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-level synthesis (HLS) is an automated design process that transforms high-level code into hardware designs, enabling the rapid development of hardware accelerators. HLS relies on pragmas, which are directives inserted into the source code to guide the synthesis process, and pragmas have various settings and values that significantly impact the resulting hardware design. State-of-the-art ML-based HLS methods, such as HARP, first train a deep learning model, typically based on graph neural networks (GNNs) applied to graph-based representations of the source code and pragmas. They then perform design space exploration (DSE) to explore the pragma design space, rank candidate designs using the model, and return the top designs. However, traditional DSE methods face challenges due to the highly nonlinear relationship between pragma settings and performance metrics, along with complex interactions between pragmas that affect performance in non-obvious ways. To address these challenges, we propose compareXplore, a novel approach that learns to compare hardware designs for effective HLS optimization. CompareXplore introduces a hybrid loss function that combines pairwise preference learning with pointwise performance prediction, enabling the model to capture both relative preferences and absolute performance. Moreover, we introduce a novel node difference attention module that focuses on the most informative differences between designs, enabling the model to identify critical pragmas impacting performance. CompareXplore adopts a two-stage DSE, where a pointwise prediction model is used for the initial design pruning, followed by a pairwise comparison stage for precise performance verification. In extensive experiments, compareXplore achieves significant improvements in ranking metrics and generates high-quality HLS results for the selected designs, outperforming the existing SOTA method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in MLCAD 2024</p></details> |

Although significantly more work is needed to support a robust assessment in this direction, these results suggest that deep-learning and the numerical solution of the Boltzmann equation represent two equivalent, but largely distinct paths to the same physical knowledge.

The Convolution-based Unlearnable DAtaset (CUDA) method aims to make data unlearnable by applying class-wise blurs to every image in the dataset so that neural networks learn relations between blur kernels and labels, as opposed to informative features for classifying clean data. In this work, we evaluate whether CUDA data remains unlearnable after image sharpening and frequency filtering, finding that this combination of simple transforms improves the utility of CUDA data for training. In particular, we observe a substantial increase in test accuracy over adversarial training for models trained with CUDA unlearnable data from CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-100. In training models to high accuracy using unlearnable data, we underscore the need for ongoing refinement in data poisoning techniques to ensure data privacy. Our method opens new avenues for enhancing the robustness of unlearnable datasets by highlighting that simple methods such as sharpening and frequency filtering are capable of breaking convolution-based unlearnable datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AdvML-Frontiers Workshop at NeurIPS 2024.

Recent breakthroughs in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have shown significant promise in development of advanced Deep Learning (DL) architectures for breast cancer diagnosis through mammography. In this context, the paper focuses on the integration of AI within a Human-Centric workflow to enhance breast cancer diagnostics. Key challenges are, however, largely overlooked such as reliance on detailed tumor annotations and susceptibility to missing views, particularly during test time. To address these issues, we propose a hybrid, multi-scale and multi-view Swin Transformer-based framework (MSMV-Swin) that enhances diagnostic robustness and accuracy. The proposed MSMV-Swin framework is designed to work as a decision-support tool, helping radiologists analyze multi-view mammograms more effectively. More specifically, the MSMV-Swin framework leverages the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to isolate the breast lobe, reducing background noise and enabling comprehensive feature extraction. The multi-scale nature of the proposed MSMV-Swin framework accounts for tumor-specific regions as well as the spatial characteristics of tissues surrounding the tumor, capturing both localized and contextual information. The integration of contextual and localized data ensures that MSMV-Swin's outputs align with the way radiologists interpret mammograms, fostering better human-AI interaction and trust. A hybrid fusion structure is then designed to ensure robustness against missing views, a common occurrence in clinical practice when only a single mammogram view is available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Comparison of Visual Trackers for Biomechanical Analysis of Running](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04713v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human pose estimation has witnessed significant advancements in recent years, mainly due to the integration of deep learning models, the availability of a vast amount of data, and large computational resources. These developments have led to highly accurate body tracking systems, which have direct applications in sports analysis and performance evaluation. This work analyzes the performance of six trackers: two point trackers and four joint trackers for biomechanical analysis in sprints. The proposed framework compares the results obtained from these pose trackers with the manual annotations of biomechanical experts for more than 5870 frames. The experimental framework employs forty sprints from five professional runners, focusing on three key angles in sprint biomechanics: trunk inclination, hip flex extension, and knee flex extension. We propose a post-processing module for outlier detection and fusion prediction in the joint angles. The experimental results demonstrate that using joint-based models yields root mean squared errors ranging from 11.41{\deg} to 4.37{\deg}. When integrated with the post-processing modules, these errors can be reduced to 6.99{\deg} and 3.88{\deg}, respectively. The experimental findings suggest that human pose tracking approaches can be valuable resources for the biomechanical analysis of running. However, there is still room for improvement in applications where high accuracy is required.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint of the paper presented to the Third Workshop on Learning with Few or Without Annotated Face, Body, and Gesture Data on 19th IEEE Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition 2025</p></details> |

However, it is often the case that data in spectroscopy is scarce, and this usually causes severe overfitting problems with deep learning methods. Traditional machine learning methods are viable when datasets are smaller, but the accuracy and applicability of these methods is generally more limited. We introduce a deep learning method for classification of molecular spectra based on learning integral operators via integral equations of the first kind, which results in an algorithm that is less affected by overfitting issues on small datasets, compared to other deep learning models. The problem formulation of the deep learning approach is based on inverse problems, which have traditionally found important applications in spectroscopy. We perform experiments on real world data to showcase our algorithm. It is seen that the model outperforms traditional machine learning approaches such as decision tree and support vector machine, and for small datasets it outperforms other deep learning models. Therefore, our methodology leverages the power of deep learning, still maintaining the performance when the available data is very limited, which is one of the main issues that deep learning faces in spectroscopy, where datasets are often times of small size.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages. v2: Link to code repository added.

Traditional heuristics based on handcrafted rules often lack accuracy, while recently proposed deep learning approaches suffer from computational cost, lack of explainability, and generalization issues that limit their practical adoption. In this paper, we introduce TrajEvo, a framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically design trajectory prediction heuristics. TrajEvo employs an evolutionary algorithm to generate and refine prediction heuristics from past trajectory data. We introduce a Cross-Generation Elite Sampling to promote population diversity and a Statistics Feedback Loop allowing the LLM to analyze alternative predictions. Our evaluations show TrajEvo outperforms previous heuristic methods on the ETH-UCY datasets, and remarkably outperforms both heuristics and deep learning methods when generalizing to the unseen SDD dataset. TrajEvo represents a first step toward automated design of fast, explainable, and generalizable trajectory prediction heuristics.

Still, existing deep learning-based methods often require significant computational costs to generate diverse stylized results. Motivated by this, we propose a novel reinforcement learning-based framework for arbitrary style transfer RLMiniStyler. This framework leverages a unified reinforcement learning policy to iteratively guide the style transfer process by exploring and exploiting stylization feedback, generating smooth sequences of stylized results while achieving model lightweight. Furthermore, we introduce an uncertainty-aware multi-task learning strategy that automatically adjusts loss weights to adapt to the content and style balance requirements at different training stages, thereby accelerating model convergence. Through a series of experiments across image various resolutions, we have validated the advantages of RLMiniStyler over other state-of-the-art methods in generating high-quality, diverse artistic image sequences at a lower cost.

Unlike standard summation neurons, product units enable multiplicative feature interactions, potentially offering a more powerful representation of complex patterns. PURe replaces conventional convolutional layers with 2D product units in the second layer of each residual block, eliminating nonlinear activation functions to preserve structural information. We validate PURe on three benchmark datasets. On Galaxy10 DECaLS, PURe34 achieves the highest test accuracy of 84.89%, surpassing the much deeper ResNet152, while converging nearly five times faster and demonstrating strong robustness to Poisson noise. On ImageNet, PURe architectures outperform standard ResNet models at similar depths, with PURe34 achieving a top-1 accuracy of 80.27% and top-5 accuracy of 95.78%, surpassing deeper ResNet variants (ResNet50, ResNet101) while utilizing significantly fewer parameters and computational resources. On CIFAR-10, PURe consistently outperforms ResNet variants across varying depths, with PURe272 reaching 95.01% test accuracy, comparable to ResNet1001 but at less than half the model size. These results demonstrate that PURe achieves a favorable balance between accuracy, efficiency, and robustness. Compared to traditional residual networks, PURe not only achieves competitive classification performance with faster convergence and fewer parameters, but also demonstrates greater robustness to noise. Its effectiveness across diverse datasets highlights the potential of product-unit-based architectures for scalable and reliable deep learning in computer vision.</p></details> |  |

High-level perception functions are increasingly based on deep learning (DL) models due to their improved performance and generalisability compared to traditional algorithms. Despite the vital need to evaluate the performance of DL-based perception functions under real-world conditions using onboard sensor inputs, there is a lack of frameworks to implement such systematic evaluations. This paper presents a versatile framework to evaluate the impact of perception sensor modalities and parameter settings on DL-based perception functions. Using a simulation environment, the framework facilitates sensor modality selection and parameter tuning under different operational design domain conditions. Its effectiveness is demonstrated through a case study involving a state-of-the-art surround trajectory prediction model, highlighting performance differences across the sensor modalities radar and camera. Different settings for the parameter, horizontal field of view (HFOV) were evaluated to identify the optimal configuration. The results indicate that a radar sensor with a narrow HFOV is the most suitable configuration for the evaluated perception algorithm. The proposed framework offers a holistic approach to the design of the perception sensor suite, significantly contributing to the development of robust perception systems for automated driving systems.</p></details> | 11 pages, 10 figures |

However, the undoubted complexity of new investments in renewables, as well as the phase out of high CO2-emission energy sources, hampers the pace of the energy transition and raises doubts as to whether new renewable energy sources are capable of solely meeting the climate target goals. This highlights the need to investigate alternative pathways to accelerate the energy transition, by identifying human activity domains with higher/excessive energy demands. Two notable examples where there is room for improvement, in the sense of reducing energy consumption and consequently CO2 emissions, are residential energy consumption and road transport. This dissertation investigates the development of novel Deep Learning techniques to create tools which solve limitations in these two key energy domains. Reduction of residential energy consumption can be achieved by empowering end-users with the user of Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring, whereas optimization of EV charging with Deep Reinforcement Learning can tackle road transport decarbonization.</p></details> | PhD thesis |

While effective, this approach may not align well with Bayesian inference, where the model space has the structure of a distribution space. Taking an information-geometric perspective, we reinterpret FL aggregation as the problem of finding the barycenter of local posteriors using a prespecified divergence metric, minimizing the average discrepancy across clients. This perspective provides a unifying framework that generalizes many existing methods and offers crisp insights into their theoretical underpinnings. We then propose BA-BFL, an algorithm that retains the convergence properties of Federated Averaging in non-convex settings. In non-independent and identically distributed scenarios, we conduct extensive comparisons with statistical aggregation techniques, showing that BA-BFL achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while offering a geometric interpretation of the aggregation phase. Additionally, we extend our analysis to Hybrid Bayesian Deep Learning, exploring the impact of Bayesian layers on uncertainty quantification and model calibration.</p></details> |  |

Concept drift detection is a field dedicated to identifying statistical shifts that is underutilized in monitoring neural networks that may encounter inference data with distributional characteristics diverging from their training data. Given the wide variety of model architectures, applications, and datasets, it is important that concept drift detection algorithms are adaptable to different inference scenarios. In this paper, we introduce an application of the $\chi^2$ Goodness of Fit Hypothesis Test as a drift detection meta-algorithm applied to a multilayer perceptron, a convolutional neural network, and a transformer trained for machine vision as they are exposed to simulated drift during inference. To that end, we demonstrate how unexpected drops in accuracy due to concept drift can be detected without directly examining the inference outputs.

We hypothesized that the benefits of pathway integration does not arise from its biological relevance, but rather from the sparsity it introduces. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of all relevant pathway-based neural network models for predictive tasks, critically evaluating each study's contributions. From this review, we curated a subset of methods for which the source code was publicly available. The comparison of the biologically informed state-of-the-art deep learning models and their randomized counterparts showed that models based on randomized information performed equally well as biologically informed ones across different metrics and datasets. Notably, in 3 out of the 15 analyzed models, the randomized versions even outperformed their biologically informed counterparts. Moreover, pathway-informed models did not show any clear advantage in interpretability, as randomized models were still able to identify relevant disease biomarkers despite lacking explicit pathway information. Our findings suggest that pathway annotations may be too noisy or inadequately explored by current methods. Therefore, we propose a methodology that can be applied to different domains and can serve as a robust benchmark for systematically comparing novel pathway-informed models against their randomized counterparts.

We utilize VR controllers and eye-tracking hardware to facilitate rapid ground truth generation and proofreading for deep learning-based cell tracking models. Life scientists reconstruct the developmental history of organisms on the cellular level by analyzing 3D time-lapse microscopy images acquired at high spatio-temporal resolution. The reconstruction of such cell lineage trees traditionally involves tracking individual cells through all recorded time points, manually annotating their positions, and then linking them over time to create complete trajectories. Deep learning-based algorithms accelerate this process, yet depend heavily on manually-annotated high-quality ground truth data and curation. Visual representation of the image data in this process still relies primarily on 2D renderings, which greatly limits spatial understanding and navigation. In this work, we bridge the gap between deep learning-based cell tracking software and 3D/VR visualization to create a human-in-the-loop cell tracking system. We lift the incremental annotation, training and proofreading loop of the deep learning model into the 3rd dimension and apply natural user interfaces like hand gestures and eye tracking to accelerate the cell tracking workflow for life scientists.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 6 figures, submitted to IEEE VIS 2025</p></details> |

Despite this progress, there is a lack of labeled datasets and open source pipelines specifically tailored for analysis of skin tissue. Here we propose Histo-Miner, a deep learning-based pipeline for analysis of skin WSIs and generate two datasets with labeled nuclei and tumor regions. We develop our pipeline for the analysis of patient samples of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), a frequent non-melanoma skin cancer. Utilizing the two datasets, comprising 47,392 annotated cell nuclei and 144 tumor-segmented WSIs respectively, both from cSCC patients, Histo-Miner employs convolutional neural networks and vision transformers for nucleus segmentation and classification as well as tumor region segmentation. Performance of trained models positively compares to state of the art with multi-class Panoptic Quality (mPQ) of 0.569 for nucleus segmentation, macro-averaged F1 of 0.832 for nucleus classification and mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 0.884 for tumor region segmentation. From these predictions we generate a compact feature vector summarizing tissue morphology and cellular interactions, which can be used for various downstream tasks. Here, we use Histo-Miner to predict cSCC patient response to immunotherapy based on pre-treatment WSIs from 45 patients. Histo-Miner identifies percentages of lymphocytes, the granulocyte to lymphocyte ratio in tumor vicinity and the distances between granulocytes and plasma cells in tumors as predictive features for therapy response. This highlights the applicability of Histo-Miner to clinically relevant scenarios, providing direct interpretation of the classification and insights into the underlying biology.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages including supplement, 5 core figures, 5 supplement figures</p></details> |

These models represent an important model class with a large number of applications in areas ranging from transport in biological cells to the motion of human crowds. While traditional numerical schemes require a large amount of tailoring, especially in the case of model design or parameter identification problems, physics informed deep operator networks (DeepONet) have emerged as a versatile tool for the solution of partial differential equations with the particular advantage that they easily incorporate parameter identification questions. We here present an approach where we first learn three DeepONet models for representative inflow, inner and outflow edges, resp., and then subsequently couple these models for the solution of the drift-diffusion metric graph problem by relying on an edge-based domain decomposition approach. We illustrate that our framework is applicable for the accurate evaluation of graph-coupled physics models and is well suited for solving optimization or inverse problems on these coupled networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Enhanced YOLOv8 Model for Real-Time and Accurate Pothole Detection and Measurement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04207v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Potholes cause vehicle damage and traffic accidents, creating serious safety and economic problems. Therefore, early and accurate detection of potholes is crucial. Existing detection methods are usually only based on 2D RGB images and cannot accurately analyze the physical characteristics of potholes. In this paper, a publicly available dataset of RGB-D images (PothRGBD) is created and an improved YOLOv8-based model is proposed for both pothole detection and pothole physical features analysis. The Intel RealSense D415 depth camera was used to collect RGB and depth data from the road surfaces, resulting in a PothRGBD dataset of 1000 images. The data was labeled in YOLO format suitable for segmentation. A novel YOLO model is proposed based on the YOLOv8n-seg architecture, which is structurally improved with Dynamic Snake Convolution (DSConv), Simple Attention Module (SimAM) and Gaussian Error Linear Unit (GELU). The proposed model segmented potholes with irregular edge structure more accurately, and performed perimeter and depth measurements on depth maps with high accuracy. The standard YOLOv8n-seg model achieved 91.9% precision, 85.2% recall and 91.9% mAP@50. With the proposed model, the values increased to 93.7%, 90.4% and 93.8% respectively. Thus, an improvement of 1.96% in precision, 6.13% in recall and 2.07% in mAP was achieved. The proposed model performs pothole detection as well as perimeter and depth measurement with high accuracy and is suitable for real-time applications due to its low model complexity. In this way, a lightweight and effective model that can be used in deep learning-based intelligent transportation solutions has been acquired.</p></details> |  |

Despite advances in deep learning, challenges such as high intra-class variance and class imbalance limit precise vessel delineation. Most existing approaches for coronary DSA segmentation cannot address these issues. Also, existing segmentation network's encoders do not directly generate semantic embeddings, which could enable the decoder to reconstruct segmentation masks effectively from these well-defined features. We propose a Supervised Prototypical Contrastive Loss that fuses supervised and prototypical contrastive learning to enhance coronary DSA image segmentation. The supervised contrastive loss enforces semantic embeddings in the encoder, improving feature differentiation. The prototypical contrastive loss allows the model to focus on the foreground class while alleviating the high intra-class variance and class imbalance problems by concentrating only on the hard-to-classify background samples. We implement the proposed SPCL loss within an MSA-UNet3+: a Multi-Scale Attention-Enhanced UNet3+ architecture. The architecture integrates key components: a Multi-Scale Attention Encoder and a Multi-Scale Dilated Bottleneck designed to enhance multi-scale feature extraction and a Contextual Attention Fusion Module built to keep fine-grained details while improving contextual understanding. Experiments on a private coronary DSA dataset show that MSA-UNet3+ outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving the highest Dice coefficient and F1-score and significantly reducing ASD and ACD. The developed framework provides clinicians with precise vessel segmentation, enabling accurate identification of coronary stenosis and supporting informed diagnostic and therapeutic decisions. The code will be released at https://github.com/rayanmerghani/MSA-UNet3plus.</p></details> | Work in progress |

However, a key limitation in all of these models is the aliasing artifacts that arise from the use of nonlinear activation functions in neural networks. In this paper, we investigate novel and modified activation functions aimed at mitigating aliasing within neural amplifier models. Supporting this, we introduce a novel metric, the Aliasing-to-Signal Ratio (ASR), which quantitatively assesses the level of aliasing with high accuracy. Measuring also the conventional Error-to-Signal Ratio (ESR), we conducted studies on a range of preexisting and modern activation functions with varying stretch factors. Our findings confirmed that activation functions with smoother curves tend to achieve lower ASR values, indicating a noticeable reduction in aliasing. Notably, this improvement in aliasing reduction was achievable without a substantial increase in ESR, demonstrating the potential for high modeling accuracy with reduced aliasing in neural amp models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to DAFx 2025</p></details> |

This study presents a novel deep learning framework that integrates graph neural networks (GNNs), transformers, and a physics-informed loss function to achieve modal decomposition and identification across a population of structures. The transformer module decomposes multi-degrees-of-freedom (MDOF) structural dynamic measurements into single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) modal responses, facilitating the identification of natural frequencies and damping ratios. Concurrently, the GNN captures the structural configurations and identifies mode shapes corresponding to the decomposed SDOF modal responses. The proposed model is trained in a purely physics-informed and unsupervised manner, leveraging modal decomposition theory and the independence of structural modes to guide learning without the need for labeled data. Validation through numerical simulations and laboratory experiments demonstrates its effectiveness in accurately decomposing dynamic responses and identifying modal properties from sparse structural dynamic measurements, regardless of variations in external loads or structural configurations. Comparative analyses against established modal identification techniques and model variations further underscore its superior performance, positioning it as a favorable approach for population-based structural health monitoring.</p></details> |  |

SDoHs have shown to be correlated to wellness outcomes, and therefore, are useful to physicians in diagnosing diseases and in decision-making. In this work, we automatically extract SDoHs from clinical text using traditional deep learning and Large Language Models (LLMs) to find the advantages and disadvantages of each on an existing publicly available dataset. Our models outperform a previous reference point on a multilabel SDoH classification by 10 points, and we present a method and model to drastically speed up classification (12X execution time) by eliminating expensive LLM processing. The method we present combines a more nimble and efficient solution that leverages the power of the LLM for precision and traditional deep learning methods for efficiency. We also show highly performant results on a dataset supplemented with synthetic data and several traditional deep learning models that outperform LLMs. Our models and methods offer the next iteration of automatic prediction of SDoHs that impact at-risk patients.</p></details> |  |

However, the sensor characteristics, proximity to the structure, hard-to-reach access, and environmental conditions often limit the resolution of the datasets. A few studies used super-resolution techniques to address the problem of low-resolution images. Nevertheless, these techniques were observed to increase computational cost and false alarms of distress detection due to the consideration of all the infrastructure images i.e., positive and negative distress classes. In order to address the pre-processing of false alarm and achieve efficient super-resolution, this study developed a framework consisting of convolutional neural network (CNN) and efficient sub-pixel convolutional neural network (ESPCNN). CNN accurately classified both the classes. ESPCNN, which is the lightweight super-resolution technique, generated high-resolution infrastructure image of positive distress obtained from CNN. The ESPCNN outperformed bicubic interpolation in all the evaluation metrics for super-resolution. Based on the performance metrics, the combination of CNN and ESPCNN was observed to be effective in preprocessing the infrastructure images with negative distress, reducing the computational cost and false alarms in the next step of super-resolution. The visual inspection showed that EPSCNN is able to capture crack propagation, complex geometry of even minor cracks. The proposed framework is expected to help the highway agencies in accurately performing distress detection and assist in efficient asset management practices.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented :Transportation Research Board 104th Annual Meeting, Washington, D.C</p></details> |

While current methods have shown promise in accurately segmenting major regions of interest, the precise segmentation of boundary areas remains challenging. In this study, we propose a novel network architecture named CTO, which combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Vision Transformer (ViT) models, and explicit edge detection operators to tackle this challenge. CTO surpasses existing methods in terms of segmentation accuracy and strikes a better balance between accuracy and efficiency, without the need for additional data inputs or label injections. Specifically, CTO adheres to the canonical encoder-decoder network paradigm, with a dual-stream encoder network comprising a mainstream CNN stream for capturing local features and an auxiliary StitchViT stream for integrating long-range dependencies. Furthermore, to enhance the model's ability to learn boundary areas, we introduce a boundary-guided decoder network that employs binary boundary masks generated by dedicated edge detection operators to provide explicit guidance during the decoding process. We validate the performance of CTO through extensive experiments conducted on seven challenging medical image segmentation datasets, namely ISIC 2016, PH2, ISIC 2018, CoNIC, LiTS17, and BTCV. Our experimental results unequivocally demonstrate that CTO achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on these datasets while maintaining competitive model complexity.

| **[Uncertainty-Aware Digital Twins: Robust Model Predictive Control using Time-Series Deep Quantile Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10337v3)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Digital Twins, virtual replicas of physical systems that enable real-time monitoring, model updates, predictions, and decision-making, present novel avenues for proactive control strategies for autonomous systems. However, achieving real-time decision-making in Digital Twins considering uncertainty necessitates an efficient uncertainty quantification (UQ) approach and optimization driven by accurate predictions of system behaviors, which remains a challenge for learning-based methods. This paper presents a simultaneous multi-step robust model predictive control (MPC) framework that incorporates real-time decision-making with uncertainty awareness for Digital Twin systems. Leveraging a multistep ahead predictor named Time-Series Dense Encoder (TiDE) as the surrogate model, this framework differs from conventional MPC models that provide only one-step ahead predictions. In contrast, TiDE can predict future states within the prediction horizon in a one-shot, significantly accelerating MPC. Furthermore, quantile regression is employed with the training of TiDE to perform flexible while computationally efficient UQ on data uncertainty. Consequently, with the deep learning quantiles, the robust MPC problem is formulated into a deterministic optimization problem and provides a safety buffer that accommodates disturbances to enhance constraint satisfaction rate. As a result, the proposed method outperforms existing robust MPC methods by providing less-conservative UQ and has demonstrated efficacy in an engineering case study involving Directed Energy Deposition (DED) additive manufacturing. This proactive while uncertainty-aware control capability positions the proposed method as a potent tool for future Digital Twin applications and real-time process control in engineering systems.</p></details> |  |

One key challenge is achieving precise positioning, especially for large aircraft structures, where errors can lead to substantial maintenance costs or part rejection. Existing solutions often require costly hardware or lack flexibility. Used in aircraft by the thousands, threaded fasteners, e.g., screws, bolts, and collars, are traditionally executed by fixed-base robots and usually have problems in being deployed in the mentioned manufacturing sites. This paper emphasizes the importance of error detection and classification for efficient and safe assembly of threaded fasteners, especially aeronautical collars. Safe assembly of threaded fasteners is paramount since acquiring sufficient data for training deep learning models poses challenges due to the rarity of failure cases and imbalanced datasets. The paper addresses this by proposing techniques like class weighting and data augmentation, specifically tailored for temporal series data, to improve classification performance. Furthermore, the paper introduces a novel problem-modeling approach, emphasizing metrics relevant to collar assembly rather than solely focusing on accuracy. This tailored approach enhances the models' capability to handle the challenges of threaded fastener assembly effectively.</p></details> |  |

However, in medical settings, merely optimising predictive performance is insufficient, as the quantification of uncertainty is equally crucial. This paper investigates the relationship between predictive uncertainty, derived from Bayesian Deep Learning approximations, and human/linguistic uncertainty, as estimated from free-text radiology reports labelled by rule-based labellers. Utilising BERT as the model of choice, this study evaluates different binarisation methods for uncertainty labels and explores the efficacy of Monte Carlo Dropout and Deep Ensembles in estimating predictive uncertainty. The results demonstrate good model performance, but also a modest correlation between predictive and linguistic uncertainty, highlighting the challenges in aligning machine uncertainty with human interpretation nuances. Our findings suggest that while Bayesian approximations provide valuable uncertainty estimates, further refinement is necessary to fully capture and utilise the subtleties of human uncertainty in clinical applications.</p></details> |  |

It supports plug-and-play integration and ensures uniform datasets, evaluation metrics, and computational constraints. We showcase clem todd's flexibility by re-evaluating existing task-oriented dialogue systems within this unified setup and integrating three newly proposed dialogue systems into the same evaluation pipeline. Our results provide actionable insights into how architecture, scale, and prompting strategies affect dialogue performance, offering practical guidance for building efficient and effective conversational AI systems.</p></details> | 30 pages |

To address this, we introduce GesPrompt, a multimodal XR interface that combines co-speech gestures with speech, allowing end-users to communicate more naturally and accurately with LLM-based copilots in XR environments. By incorporating gestures, GesPrompt extracts spatial-temporal reference from co-speech gestures, reducing the need for precise textual prompts and minimizing cognitive load for end-users. Our contributions include (1) a workflow to integrate gesture and speech input in the XR environment, (2) a prototype VR system that implements the workflow, and (3) a user study demonstrating its effectiveness in improving user communication in VR environments.</p></details> |  |

Model-driven data filtering has increasingly become a primary approach for acquiring high-quality data. However, it still faces two main challenges: (1) the lack of an efficient data verification strategy makes it difficult to provide timely feedback on data quality; and (2) the selection of seed data for training classifiers lacks clear criteria and relies heavily on human expertise, introducing a degree of subjectivity. To address the first challenge, we introduce an efficient verification strategy that enables rapid evaluation of the impact of data on LLM training with minimal computational cost. To tackle the second challenge, we build upon the assumption that high-quality seed data is beneficial for LLM training, and by integrating the proposed verification strategy, we optimize the selection of positive and negative samples and propose an efficient data filtering pipeline. This pipeline not only improves filtering efficiency, classifier quality, and robustness, but also significantly reduces experimental and inference costs. In addition, to efficiently filter high-quality data, we employ a lightweight classifier based on fastText, and successfully apply the filtering pipeline to two widely-used pre-training corpora, FineWeb and Chinese FineWeb datasets, resulting in the creation of the higher-quality Ultra-FineWeb dataset. Ultra-FineWeb contains approximately 1 trillion English tokens and 120 billion Chinese tokens. Empirical results demonstrate that the LLMs trained on Ultra-FineWeb exhibit significant performance improvements across multiple benchmark tasks, validating the effectiveness of our pipeline in enhancing both data quality and training efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>The d...</summary><p>The datasets are available on https://huggingface.co/datasets/openbmb/UltraFineWeb</p></details> |

However, existing evaluation metrics prioritize mechanical accuracy over artistic expression and tend to overrate machine translation (MT) as being superior to experienced professional human translation. In the long run, this bias could result in a permanent decline in translation quality and cultural authenticity. In response to the urgent need for a specialized literary evaluation metric, we introduce TransProQA, a novel, reference-free, LLM-based question-answering (QA) framework designed specifically for literary translation evaluation. TransProQA uniquely integrates insights from professional literary translators and researchers, focusing on critical elements in literary quality assessment such as literary devices, cultural understanding, and authorial voice. Our extensive evaluation shows that while literary-finetuned XCOMET-XL yields marginal gains, TransProQA substantially outperforms current metrics, achieving up to 0.07 gain in correlation (ACC-EQ and Kendall's tau) and surpassing the best state-of-the-art (SOTA) metrics by over 15 points in adequacy assessments. Incorporating professional translator insights as weights further improves performance, highlighting the value of translator inputs. Notably, TransProQA approaches human-level evaluation performance comparable to trained linguistic annotators. It demonstrates broad applicability to open-source models such as LLaMA3.3-70b and Qwen2.5-32b, indicating its potential as an accessible and training-free literary evaluation metric and a valuable tool for evaluating texts that require local processing due to copyright or ethical considerations.</p></details> | WIP |

With the rise of large language models in automated news and content creation, there is growing concern that these systems may introduce or even amplify framing biases compared to human authors. In this paper, we explore how framing manifests in both out-of-the-box and fine-tuned LLM-generated news content. Our analysis reveals that, particularly in politically and socially sensitive contexts, LLMs tend to exhibit more pronounced framing than their human counterparts. In addition, we observe significant variation in framing tendencies across different model architectures, with some models displaying notably higher biases. These findings point to the need for effective post-training mitigation strategies and tighter evaluation frameworks to ensure that automated news content upholds the standards of balanced reporting.</p></details> |  |

We investigate evaluation strategies and update methods for LLMs as new data becomes available. We introduce a web-scale dataset for time-continual pretraining of LLMs derived from 114 dumps of Common Crawl (CC) - orders of magnitude larger than previous continual language modeling benchmarks. We also design time-stratified evaluations across both general CC data and specific domains (Wikipedia, StackExchange, and code documentation) to assess how well various continual learning methods adapt to new data while retaining past knowledge. Our findings demonstrate that, on general CC data, autoregressive meta-schedules combined with a fixed-ratio replay of older data can achieve comparable held-out loss to re-training from scratch, while requiring significantly less computation (2.6x). However, the optimal balance between incorporating new data and replaying old data differs as replay is crucial to avoid forgetting on generic web data but less so on specific domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at: https://github.com/apple/ml-tic-lm</p></details> |

However, existing differential testing techniques for deep learning (DL) libraries are limited by the key challenges of finding alternative implementations (called counterparts) for a given API and subsequently generating diverse test inputs. To address the two challenges, this paper introduces DLLens, an LLM-enhanced differential testing technique for DL libraries. To address the first challenge, DLLens incorporates an LLM-based counterpart synthesis workflow, with the insight that the counterpart of a given DL library API's computation could be successfully synthesized through certain composition and adaptation of the APIs from another DL library. To address the second challenge, DLLens incorporates a static analysis technique that extracts the path constraints from the implementations of a given API and its counterpart to guide diverse test input generation. The extraction is facilitated by LLM's knowledge of the concerned DL library and its upstream libraries. We evaluate DLLens on two popular DL libraries, TensorFlow and PyTorch. Our evaluation shows that DLLens synthesizes counterparts for 1.84 times as many APIs as those found by state-of-the-art techniques on these libraries. Moreover, under the same time budget, DLLens covers 7.23% more branches and detects 1.88 times as many bugs as state-of-the-art techniques on 200 randomly sampled APIs. DLLens has successfully detected 71 bugs in recent TensorFlow and PyTorch libraries. Among them, 59 are confirmed by developers, including 46 confirmed as previously unknown bugs, and 10 of these previously unknown bugs have been fixed in the latest version of TensorFlow and PyTorch.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted by ACM TOSEM.

However, deploying these agentic LLM-based Text-to-SQL systems in production poses substantial challenges due to their inherently multi-stage workflows, stringent latency constraints, and potentially heterogeneous GPU infrastructure in enterprise environments. Current LLM serving frameworks lack effective mechanisms for handling interdependent inference tasks, dynamic latency variability, and resource heterogeneity, leading to suboptimal performance and frequent service-level objective (SLO) violations. In this paper, we introduce HEXGEN-TEXT2SQL, a novel framework designed explicitly to schedule and execute agentic multi-stage LLM-based Text-to-SQL workflows on heterogeneous GPU clusters that handle multi-tenant end-to-end queries. HEXGEN-TEXT2SQL introduce a hierarchical scheduling approach combining global workload-balanced task dispatching and local adaptive urgency-guided prioritization, guided by a systematic analysis of agentic Text-to-SQL workflows. Additionally, we propose a lightweight simulation-based method for tuning critical scheduling hyperparameters, further enhancing robustness and adaptability. Our extensive evaluation on realistic Text-to-SQL benchmarks demonstrates that HEXGEN-TEXT2SQL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLM serving frameworks. Specifically, HEXGEN-TEXT2SQL reduces latency deadlines by up to 1.67$\times$ (average: 1.41$\times$) and improves system throughput by up to 1.75$\times$ (average: 1.65$\times$) compared to vLLM under diverse, realistic workload conditions.

The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has sparked interest in leveraging their pre-trained knowledge for few-shot tabular learning. Despite promising results, existing approaches either rely on test-time knowledge extraction, which introduces undesirable latency, or text-level knowledge, which leads to unreliable feature engineering. To overcome these limitations, we propose Latte, a training-time knowledge extraction framework that transfers the latent prior knowledge within LLMs to optimize a more generalized downstream model. Latte enables general knowledge-guided downstream tabular learning, facilitating the weighted fusion of information across different feature values while reducing the risk of overfitting to limited labeled data. Furthermore, Latte is compatible with existing unsupervised pre-training paradigms and effectively utilizes available unlabeled samples to overcome the performance limitations imposed by an extremely small labeled dataset. Extensive experiments on various few-shot tabular learning benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of Latte, establishing it as a state-of-the-art approach in this domain</p></details> |  |

However, existing benchmarks often lack coverage in vertical domains and offer limited insights into the Chinese working context. Leveraging qualification exams as a unified framework for human expertise evaluation, we introduce QualBench, the first multi-domain Chinese QA benchmark dedicated to localized assessment of Chinese LLMs. The dataset includes over 17,000 questions across six vertical domains, with data selections grounded in 24 Chinese qualifications to closely align with national policies and working standards. Through comprehensive evaluation, the Qwen2.5 model outperformed the more advanced GPT-4o, with Chinese LLMs consistently surpassing non-Chinese models, highlighting the importance of localized domain knowledge in meeting qualification requirements. The best performance of 75.26% reveals the current gaps in domain coverage within model capabilities. Furthermore, we present the failure of LLM collaboration with crowdsourcing mechanisms and suggest the opportunities for multi-domain RAG knowledge enhancement and vertical domain LLM training with Federated Learning.</p></details> |  |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer strong reasoning capabilities, their high computational cost and limited adaptability in dynamic scenarios hinder real-time deployment on edge devices. We present SmallPlan -- a novel framework leveraging LLMs as teacher models to train lightweight Small Language Models (SLMs) for high-level path planning tasks. In SmallPlan, the SLMs provide optimal action sequences to navigate across scene graphs that compactly represent full-scaled 3D scenes. The SLMs are trained in a simulation-powered, interleaved manner with LLM-guided supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). This strategy not only enables SLMs to successfully complete navigation tasks but also makes them aware of important factors like travel distance and number of trials. Through experiments, we demonstrate that the fine-tuned SLMs perform competitively with larger models like GPT-4o on sequential path planning, without suffering from hallucination and overfitting. SmallPlan is resource-efficient, making it well-suited for edge-device deployment and advancing practical autonomous robotics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper is under review</p></details> |

By modifying only a small fraction of tokens within item descriptions -- for instance, adding emotional keywords or borrowing phrases from semantically related items -- an attacker can significantly promote or demote targeted items. We formalize these attacks under token-edit and semantic-similarity constraints, and we examine their effectiveness in both promotion (long-tail items) and demotion (short-head items) scenarios. Our experiments on MovieLens, using two large language model (LLM) retrieval modules, show that even subtle attacks shift final rankings and item exposures while eluding naive detection. The results underscore the vulnerability of RAG-based pipelines to small-scale metadata rewrites and emphasize the need for robust textual consistency checks and provenance tracking to thwart stealthy provider-side poisoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Faster, Cheaper, Better: Multi-Objective Hyperparameter Optimization for LLM and RAG Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18635v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a popular technique for improving Large Language Model (LLM) systems, it introduces a large number of choices, parameters and hyperparameters that must be made or tuned. This includes the LLM, embedding, and ranker models themselves, as well as hyperparameters governing individual RAG components. Yet, collectively optimizing the entire configuration in a RAG or LLM system remains under-explored - especially in multi-objective settings - due to intractably large solution spaces, noisy objective evaluations, and the high cost of evaluations. In this work, we introduce the first approach for multi-objective parameter optimization of cost, latency, safety and alignment over entire LLM and RAG systems. We find that Bayesian optimization methods significantly outperform baseline approaches, obtaining a superior Pareto front on two new RAG benchmark tasks. We conclude our work with important considerations for practitioners who are designing multi-objective RAG systems, highlighting nuances such as how optimal configurations may not generalize across tasks and objectives.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Mitigating API Hallucination in Code Generated by LLMs with Hierarchical Dependency Aware](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05057v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are crucial in modern software development. Large Language Models (LLMs) assist in automated code generation but often struggle with API hallucination, including invoking non-existent APIs and misusing existing ones in practical development scenarios. Existing studies resort to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods for mitigating the hallucination issue, but tend to fail since they generally ignore the structural dependencies in practical projects and do not indeed validate whether the generated APIs are available or not. To address these limitations, we propose MARIN, a framework for mitigating API hallucination in code generated by LLMs with hierarchical dependency aware. MARIN consists of two phases: Hierarchical Dependency Mining, which analyzes local and global dependencies of the current function, aiming to supplement comprehensive project context in LLMs input, and Dependency Constrained Decoding, which utilizes mined dependencies to adaptively constrain the generation process, aiming to ensure the generated APIs align with the projects specifications. To facilitate the evaluation of the degree of API hallucination, we introduce a new benchmark APIHulBench and two new metrics including Micro Hallucination Number (MiHN) and Macro Hallucination Rate (MaHR). Experiments on six state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate that MARIN effectively reduces API hallucinations, achieving an average decrease of 67.52% in MiHN and 73.56% in MaHR compared to the RAG approach. Applied to Huaweis internal projects and two proprietary LLMs, MARIN achieves average decreases of 57.33% in MiHN and 59.41% in MaHR.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by FSE 2025 Industry Track</p></details> |

A key bottleneck is evaluating intermediate reasoning steps to guide generation without costly human annotations. To address this, we first introduce a novel Process Reward Model (PRM) trained automatically using Monte Carlo Tree Search coupled with a similarity-based data augmentation technique, effectively capturing step-level reasoning quality. Leveraging this PRM, we then adapt Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to operate at the reasoning step level. Unlike traditional reinforcement learning focused on maximizing a single reward, GFlowNets naturally sample diverse, high-quality solutions proportional to their rewards, as measured by our PRM. Empirical evaluation shows strong improvements in both accuracy and solution diversity on challenging mathematical benchmarks (e.g., +2.59% absolute accuracy on MATH Level 5 for Llama3.2-3B), with effective generalization to unseen datasets (+9.4% absolute on SAT MATH). Our work demonstrates the potential of PRM-guided, step-level GFlowNets for developing more robust and versatile mathematical reasoning in LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Power of Stories: Narrative Priming Shapes How LLM Agents Collaborate and Compete](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03961v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>According to Yuval Noah Harari, large-scale human cooperation is driven by shared narratives that encode common beliefs and values. This study explores whether such narratives can similarly nudge LLM agents toward collaboration. We use a finitely repeated public goods game in which LLM agents choose either cooperative or egoistic spending strategies. We prime agents with stories highlighting teamwork to different degrees and test how this influences negotiation outcomes. Our experiments explore four questions:(1) How do narratives influence negotiation behavior? (2) What differs when agents share the same story versus different ones? (3) What happens when the agent numbers grow? (4) Are agents resilient against self-serving negotiators? We find that story-based priming significantly affects negotiation strategies and success rates. Common stories improve collaboration, benefiting each agent. By contrast, priming agents with different stories reverses this effect, and those agents primed toward self-interest prevail. We hypothesize that these results carry implications for multi-agent system design and AI alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 8 figures.

Multi-LLM Repeated Sampling Efficiently Scales Test-Time Compute](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00762v4)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a simple, effective, and cost-efficient strategy to improve LLM performance by scaling test-time compute. Our strategy builds upon the repeated-sampling-then-voting framework, with a novel twist: incorporating multiple models, even weaker ones, to leverage their complementary strengths that potentially arise from diverse training data and paradigms. By using consistency as a signal, our strategy dynamically switches between models. Theoretical analysis highlights the efficiency and performance advantages of our strategy. Extensive experiments on six datasets demonstrate that our strategy not only outperforms self-consistency and state-of-the-art multi-agent debate approaches, but also significantly reduces inference costs. Additionally, ModelSwitch requires only a few comparable LLMs to achieve optimal performance and can be extended with verification methods, demonstrating the potential of leveraging multiple LLMs in the generation-verification paradigm.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Pitfalls of Growing Group Complexity: LLMs and Social Choice-Based Aggregation for Group Recommendations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05016v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in recommender systems aimed at both individuals and groups. Previously, Group Recommender Systems (GRS) often used social choice-based aggregation strategies to derive a single recommendation based on the preferences of multiple people. In this paper, we investigate under which conditions language models can perform these strategies correctly based on zero-shot learning and analyse whether the formatting of the group scenario in the prompt affects accuracy. We specifically focused on the impact of group complexity (number of users and items), different LLMs, different prompting conditions, including In-Context learning or generating explanations, and the formatting of group preferences. Our results show that performance starts to deteriorate when considering more than 100 ratings. However, not all language models were equally sensitive to growing group complexity. Additionally, we showed that In-Context Learning (ICL) can significantly increase the performance at higher degrees of group complexity, while adding other prompt modifications, specifying domain cues or prompting for explanations, did not impact accuracy. We conclude that future research should include group complexity as a factor in GRS evaluation due to its effect on LLM performance. Furthermore, we showed that formatting the group scenarios differently, such as rating lists per user or per item, affected accuracy. All in all, our study implies that smaller LLMs are capable of generating group recommendations under the right conditions, making the case for using smaller models that require less computing power and costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in: Adjunct Proceedings of the 33rd ACM Conference on User Modeling, Adaptation and Personalization (UMAP Adjunct '25), June 16--19, 2025, New York City, NY, USA Accepted at the 4th Workshop on Group Modeling, Adaptation and Personalization (GMAP), co-located at UMAP 2025</p></details> |
| **[LLM-Driven Usefulness Judgment for Web Search Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14401v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluation is fundamental in optimizing search experiences and supporting diverse user intents in Information Retrieval (IR). Traditional search evaluation methods primarily rely on relevance labels, which assess how well retrieved documents match a user's query. However, relevance alone fails to capture a search system's effectiveness in helping users achieve their search goals, making usefulness a critical evaluation criterion. In this paper, we explore an alternative approach: LLM-generated usefulness labels, which incorporate both implicit and explicit user behavior signals to evaluate document usefulness. We propose Task-aware Rubric-based Usefulness Evaluation (TRUE), a rubric-driven evaluation method that employs iterative sampling and reasoning to model complex search behavior patterns. Our findings show that (i) LLMs can generate moderate usefulness labels by leveraging comprehensive search session history incorporating personalization and contextual understanding, and (ii) fine-tuned LLMs improve usefulness judgments when provided with structured search session contexts. Additionally, we examine whether LLMs can distinguish between relevance and usefulness, particularly in cases where this divergence impacts search success. We also conduct an ablation study to identify key metrics for accurate usefulness label generation, optimizing for token efficiency and cost-effectiveness in real-world applications. This study advances LLM-based usefulness evaluation by refining key user metrics, exploring LLM-generated label reliability, and ensuring feasibility for large-scale search systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-Assisted Relevance Assessments: When Should We Ask LLMs for Help?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06877v3)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test collections are information retrieval tools that allow researchers to quickly and easily evaluate ranking algorithms. While test collections have become an integral part of IR research, the process of data creation involves significant effort in manual annotations, which often makes it very expensive and time-consuming. Thus, test collections could become too small when the budget is limited, which may lead to unstable evaluations. As a cheaper alternative, recent studies have proposed the use of large language models (LLMs) to completely replace human assessors. However, while LLMs seem to somewhat correlate with human judgments, their predictions are not perfect and often show bias. Thus a complete replacement with LLMs is argued to be too risky and not fully reliable. Thus, in this paper, we propose LLM-Assisted Relevance Assessments (LARA), an effective method to balance manual annotations with LLM annotations, which helps to build a rich and reliable test collection even under a low budget. We use the LLM's predicted relevance probabilities to select the most profitable documents to manually annotate under a budget constraint. With theoretical reasoning, LARA effectively guides the human annotation process by actively learning to calibrate the LLM's predicted relevance probabilities. Then, using the calibration model learned from the limited manual annotations, LARA debiases the LLM predictions to annotate the remaining non-assessed data. Empirical evaluations on TREC-7 Ad Hoc, TREC-8 Ad Hoc, TREC Robust 2004, and TREC-COVID datasets show that LARA outperforms alternative solutions under almost any budget constraint.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages.

While extensive research has explored the effectiveness of LLMs in supporting student learning, limited studies have examined how these models can assist instructors in designing instructional activities. This work investigates how instructors' expertise in effective activity design can be integrated with LLMs' ability to generate novel and targeted programming problems, facilitating more effective activity creation for programming classrooms. To achieve this, we employ a participatory design approach to develop an instructor-authoring tool that incorporates LLM support, fostering collaboration between instructors and AI in generating programming exercises. This tool also allows instructors to specify common student mistakes and misconceptions, which informs the adaptive feedback generation process. We conduct case studies with three instructors, analyzing how they use our system to design programming problems for their introductory courses. Through these case studies, we assess instructors' perceptions of the usefulness and limitations of LLMs in authoring problem statements for instructional purposes. Additionally, we compare the efficiency, quality, effectiveness, and coverage of designed activities when instructors create problems with and without structured LLM prompting guidelines. Our findings provide insights into the potential of LLMs in enhancing instructor workflows and improving programming education and provide guidelines for designing effective AI-assisted problem-authoring interfaces.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CHI 2025 Workshop on Augmented Educators and AI: Shaping the Future of Human and AI Cooperation in Learning</p></details> |

These models, like OpenAI's o1, focus on scaling computational resources dynamically during complex tasks, such as math reasoning, visual reasoning, medical diagnosis, and multi-agent debates. We present the development of reasoning LLMs and list their key technologies. By synthesizing over 100 studies, it charts a path toward LLMs that combine human-like deep thinking with scalable efficiency for reasoning. The review breaks down methods into three categories: (1) test-time scaling dynamically adjusts computation based on task complexity via search and sampling, dynamic verification; (2) reinforced learning refines decision-making through iterative improvement leveraging policy networks, reward models, and self-evolution strategies; and (3) slow-thinking frameworks (e.g., long CoT, hierarchical processes) that structure problem-solving with manageable steps. The survey highlights the challenges and further directions of this domain. Understanding and advancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs is crucial for unlocking their full potential in real-world applications, from scientific discovery to decision support systems.</p></details> |  |

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been adopted for prompt-based recommendation due to their ability to generate personalized outputs without task-specific training. However, LLM-based methods face limitations such as limited context window size, inefficient pointwise and pairwise prompting, and difficulty handling listwise ranking due to token constraints. LLMs can also be sensitive to position bias, as they may overemphasize earlier items in the prompt regardless of their true relevance. To address and investigate these issues, we propose a hybrid framework that combines a traditional recommendation model with an LLM for reranking top-k items using structured prompts. We evaluate the effects of user history reordering and instructional prompts for mitigating position bias. Experiments on MovieLens-100K show that randomizing user history improves ranking quality, but LLM-based reranking does not outperform the base model. Explicit instructions to reduce position bias are also ineffective. Our evaluations reveal limitations in LLMs' ability to model ranking context and mitigate bias.

However, even when provided context, LLMs still frequently introduce unsupported information or contradictions. This paper presents our efforts to measure LLM hallucinations with a focus on summarization tasks, assessing how often various LLMs introduce hallucinations when summarizing documents. We discuss Vectara's existing LLM hallucination leaderboard, based on the Hughes Hallucination Evaluation Model (HHEM). While HHEM and Vectara's Hallucination Leaderboard have garnered great research interest, we examine challenges faced by HHEM and current hallucination detection methods by analyzing the effectiveness of these methods on existing hallucination datasets. To address these limitations, we propose FaithJudge, an LLM-as-a-judge approach guided by few-shot human hallucination annotations, which substantially improves automated LLM hallucination evaluation over current methods. We introduce an enhanced hallucination leaderboard centered on FaithJudge, alongside our current hallucination leaderboard, enabling more reliable benchmarking of LLMs for hallucinations in RAG.</p></details> |  |

This hinders test-time compute scaling that relies on using the value-function for verification. In this work, we propose RL$^V$ that augments any ``value-free'' RL method by jointly training the LLM as both a reasoner and a generative verifier using RL-generated data, adding verification capabilities without significant overhead. Empirically, RL$^V$ boosts MATH accuracy by over 20\% with parallel sampling and enables $8-32\times$ efficient test-time compute scaling compared to the base RL method. RL$^V$ also exhibits strong generalization capabilities for both easy-to-hard and out-of-domain tasks. Furthermore, RL$^V$ achieves $1.2-1.6\times$ higher performance when jointly scaling parallel and sequential test-time compute with a long reasoning R1 model.</p></details> |  |

While large language models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for dynamic feedback generation, they risk producing hallucinations or pedagogically unsound explanations. We evaluated the stepwise accuracy of LLMs in constructing multi-step symbolic logic proofs, comparing six prompting techniques across four state-of-the-art LLMs on 358 propositional logic problems. Results show that DeepSeek-V3 achieved superior performance with 84.4% accuracy on stepwise proof construction and excelled particularly in simpler rules. We further used the best-performing LLM to generate explanatory hints for 1,050 unique student problem-solving states from a logic ITS and evaluated them on 4 criteria with both an LLM grader and human expert ratings on a 20% sample. Our analysis finds that LLM-generated hints were 75% accurate and rated highly by human evaluators on consistency and clarity, but did not perform as well explaining why the hint was provided or its larger context. Our results demonstrate that LLMs may be used to augment tutoring systems with logic tutoring hints, but requires additional modifications to ensure accuracy and pedagogical appropriateness.</p></details> |  |

This can be crucial for tasks such as patent matching, legal or compliance case retrieval, and academic literature review. Existing retrieval methods, including keyword search and document embeddings, can be optimized with domain-specific datasets to improve QBD search performance. However, creating these domain-specific datasets is often costly and time-consuming. Our work introduces a process to generate custom QBD-search datasets and compares a set of methods to use in this problem, which we refer to as QBD-RankedDatagen. We provide a comparative analysis of our proposed methods in terms of cost, speed, and the human interface with the domain experts. The methods we compare leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) which can incorporate domain expert input to produce document scores and rankings, as well as explanations for human review. The process and methods for it that we present can significantly reduce human effort in dataset creation for custom domains while still obtaining sufficient expert knowledge for tuning retrieval models. We evaluate our methods on QBD datasets from the Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) and finetune the parameters of the BM25 model -- which is used in many industrial-strength search engines like OpenSearch -- using the generated data.</p></details> | 13 pages |

In this work, we propose SOAEsV2-7B/72B, a specialized LLM series developed via a three-phase framework: 1) continual pre-training integrates domain knowledge while retaining base capabilities; 2) domain-progressive SFT employs curriculum-based learning strategy, transitioning from weakly relevant conversational data to expert-annotated SOAEs datasets to optimize domain-specific tasks; 3) distillation-enhanced speculative decoding accelerates inference via logit distillation between 72B target and 7B draft models, achieving 1.39-1.52$\times$ speedup without quality loss. Experimental results demonstrate that our domain-specific pre-training phase maintains 99.8% of original general language capabilities while significantly improving domain performance, resulting in a 1.08$\times$ improvement in Rouge-1 score and a 1.17$\times$ enhancement in BLEU-4 score. Ablation studies further show that domain-progressive SFT outperforms single-stage training, achieving 1.02$\times$ improvement in Rouge-1 and 1.06$\times$ in BLEU-4. Our work introduces a comprehensive, full-pipeline approach for optimizing SOAEs LLMs, bridging the gap between general language capabilities and domain-specific expertise.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Influence Factors on LLM Suitability for No-Code Development of End User IoT Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04710v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing popularity of IoT applications, end users demand more personalized and intuitive functionality. A major obstacle for this, however, is that custom IoT functionality today still requires at least some coding skills. To address this, no-code development platforms have been proposed as a solution for empowering non-technical users to create applications. However, such platforms still require a certain level of technical expertise for structuring process steps or defining event-action relations. The advent of LLMs can further enhance no-code platforms by enabling natural language-based interaction, automating of complex tasks, and dynamic code generation. By allowing users to describe their requirements in natural language, LLMs can significantly streamline no-code development. As LLMs vary in performance, architecture, training data used, and the use cases they target, it is still unclear which models are best suited and what are the influence factors determining this fit. In particular, no-code development of IoT applications by non-technical users will have completely different demands on LLMs than, e.g., code generation for more open-ended applications or for supporting professional developers. In this paper, we explore the factors influencing the suitability of LLMs to no-code development of IoT applications. We also examine the role of input prompt language on accuracy and quality of generated applications as well as the influence of LLM training data. By conducting comprehensive experiments with a range of LLMs, we provide valuable insights for optimizing LLM-powered no-code platforms, guiding the selection of the suitable LLMs and their effective application. Our findings contribute to improving the accessibility, efficiency, and user experience of no-code IoT development, ultimately enabling broader adoption of IoT technologies among non-expert users.</p></details> |  |

Recent research has explored using reinforcement learning (RL) to improve LLMs' search capabilities by interacting with live search engines in real-world environments. While these approaches show promising results, they face two major challenges: (1) Uncontrolled Document Quality: The quality of documents returned by search engines is often unpredictable, introducing noise and instability into the training process. (2) Prohibitively High API Costs: RL training requires frequent rollouts, potentially involving hundreds of thousands of search requests, which incur substantial API expenses and severely constrain scalability. To address these challenges, we introduce ZeroSearch, a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes the search capabilities of LLMs without interacting with real search engines. Our approach begins with lightweight supervised fine-tuning to transform the LLM into a retrieval module capable of generating both relevant and noisy documents in response to a query. During RL training, we employ a curriculum-based rollout strategy that incrementally degrades the quality of generated documents, progressively eliciting the model's reasoning ability by exposing it to increasingly challenging retrieval scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ZeroSearch effectively incentivizes the search capabilities of LLMs using a 3B LLM as the retrieval module. Remarkably, a 7B retrieval module achieves comparable performance to the real search engine, while a 14B retrieval module even surpasses it. Furthermore, it generalizes well across both base and instruction-tuned models of various parameter sizes and is compatible with a wide range of RL algorithms.</p></details> |  |

These systems introduce new attack vectors where malicious apps can cause integrity violation of planning or execution, availability breakdown, or privacy compromise during execution. In this work, we identify new attacks impacting the integrity of planning, as well as the integrity and availability of execution in LLM-integrated apps, and demonstrate them against IsolateGPT, a recent solution designed to mitigate attacks from malicious apps. We propose Abstract-Concrete-Execute (ACE), a new secure architecture for LLM-integrated app systems that provides security guarantees for system planning and execution. Specifically, ACE decouples planning into two phases by first creating an abstract execution plan using only trusted information, and then mapping the abstract plan to a concrete plan using installed system apps. We verify that the plans generated by our system satisfy user-specified secure information flow constraints via static analysis on the structured plan output. During execution, ACE enforces data and capability barriers between apps, and ensures that the execution is conducted according to the trusted abstract plan. We show experimentally that our system is secure against attacks from the INJECAGENT benchmark, a standard benchmark for control flow integrity in the face of indirect prompt injection attacks, and our newly introduced attacks. Our architecture represents a significant advancement towards hardening LLM-based systems containing system facilities of varying levels of trustworthiness.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 13 figures; clarify relation to indirect prompt injection attacks</p></details> |

However, the highly dynamic, open, and heterogeneous nature of SAGINs poses severe security issues. Forming a defense line of SAGINs suffers from two preliminary challenges: 1) accurately understanding massive unstructured multi-dimensional threat information to generate defense strategies against various malicious attacks, 2) rapidly adapting to potential unknown threats to yield more effective security strategies. To tackle the above two challenges, we propose a novel security framework for SAGINs based on Large Language Models (LLMs), which consists of two key ingredients LLM-6GNG and 6G-INST. Our proposed LLM-6GNG leverages refined chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and dynamic multi-agent mechanisms to analyze massive unstructured multi-dimensional threat data and generate comprehensive security strategies, thus addressing the first challenge. Our proposed 6G-INST relies on a novel self-evolving method to automatically update LLM-6GNG, enabling it to accommodate unknown threats under dynamic communication environments, thereby addressing the second challenge. Additionally, we prototype the proposed framework with ns-3, OpenAirInterface (OAI), and software-defined radio (SDR). Experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. The results show that our framework produces highly accurate security strategies that remain robust against a variety of unknown attacks. We will release our code to contribute to the community.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Communications Magazine</p></details> |

These models assist programmers in generating code, potentially increasing productivity and efficiency. However, the environmental impact of utilising these AI models is substantial, given their high energy consumption during both training and inference stages. This research aims to compare the energy consumption of manual software development versus an LLM-assisted approach, using Codeforces as a simulation platform for software development. The goal is to quantify the environmental impact and propose strategies for minimising the carbon footprint of using LLM in software development. Our results show that the LLM-assisted code generation leads on average to 32.72 higher carbon footprint than the manual one. Moreover, there is a significant correlation between task complexity and the difference in the carbon footprint of the two approaches.</p></details> |  |

To leverage benefits like missing value imputation, labeling, and enrichment with context-aware attributes, LLM-generated data needs a critical validation process. The number of pioneering approaches is increasing fast, opening a promising validation space that, so far, remains unstructured. We present a design space for the critical validation of LLM-generated tabular data with two dimensions: First, the Analysis Granularity dimension: from within-attribute (single-item and multi-item) to across-attribute perspectives (1 x 1, 1 x m, and n x n). Second, the Data Source dimension: differentiating between LLM-generated values, ground truth values, explanations, and their combinations. We discuss analysis tasks for each dimension cross-cut, map 19 existing validation approaches, and discuss the characteristics of two approaches in detail, demonstrating descriptive power.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at the 16th International EuroVis Workshop on Visual Analytics (EuroVA'25)</p></details> |

Traditional heuristics based on handcrafted rules often lack accuracy, while recently proposed deep learning approaches suffer from computational cost, lack of explainability, and generalization issues that limit their practical adoption. In this paper, we introduce TrajEvo, a framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically design trajectory prediction heuristics. TrajEvo employs an evolutionary algorithm to generate and refine prediction heuristics from past trajectory data. We introduce a Cross-Generation Elite Sampling to promote population diversity and a Statistics Feedback Loop allowing the LLM to analyze alternative predictions. Our evaluations show TrajEvo outperforms previous heuristic methods on the ETH-UCY datasets, and remarkably outperforms both heuristics and deep learning methods when generalizing to the unseen SDD dataset. TrajEvo represents a first step toward automated design of fast, explainable, and generalizable trajectory prediction heuristics. We make our source code publicly available to foster future research at https://github.com/ai4co/trajevo.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Effectively Leveraging Execution Traces for Program Repair with Code LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04441v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) show promising performance on various programming tasks, including Automatic Program Repair (APR). However, most approaches to LLM-based APR are limited to the static analysis of the programs, while disregarding their runtime behavior. Inspired by knowledge-augmented NLP, in this work, we aim to remedy this potential blind spot by augmenting standard APR prompts with program execution traces. We evaluate our approach using the GPT family of models on three popular APR datasets. Our findings suggest that simply incorporating execution traces into the prompt provides a limited performance improvement over trace-free baselines, in only 2 out of 6 tested dataset / model configurations. We further find that the effectiveness of execution traces for APR diminishes as their complexity increases. We explore several strategies for leveraging traces in prompts and demonstrate that LLM-optimized prompts help outperform trace-free prompts more consistently. Additionally, we show trace-based prompting to be superior to finetuning a smaller LLM on a small-scale dataset; and conduct probing studies reinforcing the notion that execution traces can complement the reasoning abilities of the LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Estimating LLM Uncertainty with Logits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00290v4)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the past few years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have developed rapidly and are widely applied in various domains. However, LLMs face the issue of hallucinations, generating responses that may be unreliable when the models lack relevant knowledge. To be aware of potential hallucinations, uncertainty estimation methods have been introduced, and most of them have confirmed that reliability lies in critical tokens. However, probability-based methods perform poorly in identifying token reliability, limiting their practical utility. In this paper, we reveal that the probability-based method fails to estimate token reliability due to the loss of evidence strength information which is accumulated in the training stage. Therefore, we present Logits-induced token uncertainty (LogTokU), a framework for estimating decoupled token uncertainty in LLMs, enabling real-time uncertainty estimation without requiring multiple sampling processes. We employ evidence modeling to implement LogTokU and use the estimated uncertainty to guide downstream tasks. The experimental results demonstrate that LogTokU has significant effectiveness and promise.</p></details> | <details><summary>Fixed...</summary><p>Fixed some data errors in Table 1</p></details> |

| **[LLM-based Bi-level Multi-interest Learning Framework for Sequential Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09410v3)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential recommendation (SR) leverages users' dynamic preferences, with recent advances incorporating multi-interest learning to model diverse user interests. However, most multi-interest SR models rely on noisy, sparse implicit feedback, limiting recommendation accuracy. Large language models (LLMs) offer robust reasoning on low-quality data but face high computational costs and latency challenges for SR integration. We propose a novel LLM-based multi-interest SR framework combining implicit behavioral and explicit semantic perspectives. It includes two modules: the Implicit Behavioral Interest Module (IBIM), which learns from user behavior using a traditional SR model, and the Explicit Semantic Interest Module (ESIM), which uses clustering and prompt-engineered LLMs to extract semantic multi-interest representations from informative samples. Semantic insights from ESIM enhance IBIM's behavioral representations via modality alignment and semantic prediction tasks. During inference, only IBIM is used, ensuring efficient, LLM-free recommendations. Experiments on four real-world datasets validate the framework's effectiveness and practicality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking LLMs' Swarm intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04364v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) show potential for complex reasoning, yet their capacity for emergent coordination in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) when operating under strict constraints-such as limited local perception and communication, characteristic of natural swarms-remains largely unexplored, particularly concerning the nuances of swarm intelligence. Existing benchmarks often do not fully capture the unique challenges of decentralized coordination that arise when agents operate with incomplete spatio-temporal information. To bridge this gap, we introduce SwarmBench, a novel benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the swarm intelligence capabilities of LLMs acting as decentralized agents. SwarmBench features five foundational MAS coordination tasks within a configurable 2D grid environment, forcing agents to rely primarily on local sensory input (k x k view) and local communication. We propose metrics for coordination effectiveness and analyze emergent group dynamics. Evaluating several leading LLMs in a zero-shot setting, we find significant performance variations across tasks, highlighting the difficulties posed by local information constraints. While some coordination emerges, results indicate limitations in robust planning and strategy formation under uncertainty in these decentralized scenarios. Assessing LLMs under swarm-like conditions is crucial for realizing their potential in future decentralized systems. We release SwarmBench as an open, extensible toolkit-built upon a customizable and scalable physical system with defined mechanical properties. It provides environments, prompts, evaluation scripts, and the comprehensive experimental datasets generated, aiming to foster reproducible research into LLM-based MAS coordination and the theoretical underpinnings of Embodied MAS.

However, their increased complexity introduces novel safety and ethical challenges, particularly in multi-modal and multi-turn conversations. Traditional safety evaluation frameworks, designed for text-based, single-turn interactions, are inadequate for addressing these complexities. To bridge this gap, we introduce the REVEAL (Responsible Evaluation of Vision-Enabled AI LLMs) Framework, a scalable and automated pipeline for evaluating image-input harms in VLLMs. REVEAL includes automated image mining, synthetic adversarial data generation, multi-turn conversational expansion using crescendo attack strategies, and comprehensive harm assessment through evaluators like GPT-4o. We extensively evaluated five state-of-the-art VLLMs, GPT-4o, Llama-3.2, Qwen2-VL, Phi3.5V, and Pixtral, across three important harm categories: sexual harm, violence, and misinformation. Our findings reveal that multi-turn interactions result in significantly higher defect rates compared to single-turn evaluations, highlighting deeper vulnerabilities in VLLMs. Notably, GPT-4o demonstrated the most balanced performance as measured by our Safety-Usability Index (SUI) followed closely by Pixtral. Additionally, misinformation emerged as a critical area requiring enhanced contextual defenses. Llama-3.2 exhibited the highest MT defect rate ($16.55 \%$) while Qwen2-VL showed the highest MT refusal rate ($19.1 \%$).</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages (8 main), to be published in IJCAI 2025</p></details> |

Mitigating the Hallucination for Path Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13184v3)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) is the foundation for embodied intelligence. However, even in simple maze environments, LLMs still encounter challenges in long-term path-planning, primarily influenced by their spatial hallucination and context inconsistency hallucination by long-term reasoning. To address this challenge, this study proposes an innovative model, Spatial-to-Relational Transformation and Curriculum Q-Learning (S2RCQL). To address the spatial hallucination of LLMs, we propose the Spatial-to-Relational approach, which transforms spatial prompts into entity relations and paths representing entity relation chains. This approach fully taps the potential of LLMs in terms of sequential thinking. As a result, we design a path-planning algorithm based on Q-learning to mitigate the context inconsistency hallucination, which enhances the reasoning ability of LLMs. Using the Q-value of state-action as auxiliary information for prompts, we correct the hallucinations of LLMs, thereby guiding LLMs to learn the optimal path. Finally, we propose a reverse curriculum learning technique based on LLMs to further mitigate the context inconsistency hallucination. LLMs can rapidly accumulate successful experiences by reducing task difficulty and leveraging them to tackle more complex tasks. We performed comprehensive experiments based on Baidu's self-developed LLM: ERNIE-Bot 4.0. The results showed that our S2RCQL achieved a 23%--40% improvement in both success and optimality rates compared with advanced prompt engineering.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICIC 2025</p></details> |

However, untrained lay users have poor prompt specification abilities and often struggle with conveying their latent preferences to AI assistants. To address this, we leverage activation steering to guide LLMs to align with interpretable preference dimensions during inference. In contrast to memory-based personalization methods that require longer user history, steering is extremely lightweight and can be easily controlled by the user via an linear strength factor. We embed steering into three different interactive chatbot interfaces and conduct a within-subjects user study (n=14) to investigate how end users prefer to personalize their conversations. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of preference-based steering for aligning real-world conversations with hidden user preferences, and highlight further insights on how diverse values around control, usability, and transparency lead users to prefer different interfaces.</p></details> |  |

However, the complexity of compilation instruction search and error resolution makes automatic compilation challenging. Inspired by the success of LLM-based agents in various fields, we propose CompileAgent, the first LLM-based agent framework dedicated to repo-level compilation. CompileAgent integrates five tools and a flow-based agent strategy, enabling interaction with software artifacts for compilation instruction search and error resolution. To measure the effectiveness of our method, we design a public repo-level benchmark CompileAgentBench, and we also design two baselines for comparison by combining two compilation-friendly schemes. The performance on this benchmark shows that our method significantly improves the compilation success rate, ranging from 10% to 71%. Meanwhile, we evaluate the performance of CompileAgent under different agent strategies and verify the effectiveness of the flow-based strategy. Additionally, we emphasize the scalability of CompileAgent, further expanding its application prospects.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |

This holds true within the field of software engineering (SE) as well. The state-of-the-art research on MAS within SE focuses on integrating LLMs at the core of autonomous agents to create LLM-based multi-agent autonomous (LMA) systems. However, the introduction of LMA systems into SE brings a plethora of challenges. One of the major challenges is the strategic allocation of tasks between humans and the LMA system in a trustworthy manner. To address this challenge, a RACI-based framework is proposed in this work in progress article, along with implementation guidelines and an example implementation of the framework. The proposed framework can facilitate efficient collaboration, ensure accountability, and mitigate potential risks associated with LLM-driven automation while aligning with the Trustworthy AI guidelines. The future steps for this work delineating the planned empirical validation method are also presented.</p></details> |  |

However, even experienced developers can struggle with this task, as it requires identifying relevant code regions (feature location), generating valid code variants, and ensuring the modifications reliably align with user intent. In this paper, we introduce vTikZ, the first benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to customize code while preserving coherent visual outcomes. Our benchmark consists of carefully curated vTikZ editing scenarios, parameterized ground truths, and a reviewing tool that leverages visual feedback to assess correctness. Empirical evaluation with stateof-the-art LLMs shows that existing solutions struggle to reliably modify code in alignment with visual intent, highlighting a gap in current AI-assisted code editing approaches. We argue that vTikZ opens new research directions for integrating LLMs with visual feedback mechanisms to improve code customization tasks in various domains beyond TikZ, including image processing, art creation, Web design, and 3D modeling.</p></details> |  |

The relevance of advertiser keyphrases plays an important role in preventing the inundation of search systems with numerous irrelevant items that compete for attention in auctions, in addition to maintaining a healthy seller perception. In this work, we describe the shortcomings of training Advertiser keyphrase relevance filter models on click/sales/search relevance signals and the importance of aligning with human judgment, as sellers have the power to adopt or reject said keyphrase recommendations. In this study, we frame Advertiser keyphrase relevance as a complex interaction between 3 dynamical systems -- seller judgment, which influences seller adoption of our product, Advertising, which provides the keyphrases to bid on, and Search, who holds the auctions for the same keyphrases. This study discusses the practicalities of using human judgment via a case study at eBay Advertising and demonstrate that using LLM-as-a-judge en-masse as a scalable proxy for seller judgment to train our relevance models achieves a better harmony across the three systems -- provided that they are bound by a meticulous evaluation framework grounded in business metrics.</p></details> |  |

However, existing HBD architectures face fundamental limitations in scalability, cost, and fault resiliency: switch-centric HBDs (e.g., NVL-72) incur prohibitive scaling costs, while GPU-centric HBDs (e.g., TPUv3/Dojo) suffer from severe fault propagation. Switch-GPU hybrid HBDs such as TPUv4 takes a middle-ground approach by leveraging Optical Circuit Switches, but the fault explosion radius remains large at the cube level (e.g., 64 TPUs). We propose InfiniteHBD, a novel transceiver-centric HBD architecture that unifies connectivity and dynamic switching at the transceiver level using Optical Circuit Switching (OCS). By embedding OCS within each transceiver, InfiniteHBD achieves reconfigurable point-to-multipoint connectivity, allowing the topology to adapt into variable-size rings. This design provides: i) datacenter-wide scalability without cost explosion; ii) fault resilience by isolating failures to a single node, and iii) full bandwidth utilization for fault-free GPUs. Key innovations include a Silicon Photonic (SiPh) based low-cost OCS transceiver (OCSTrx), a reconfigurable k-hop ring topology co-designed with intra-/inter-node communication, and an HBD-DCN orchestration algorithm maximizing GPU utilization while minimizing cross-ToR datacenter network traffic. The evaluation demonstrates that InfiniteHBD achieves 31% of the cost of NVL-72, near-zero GPU waste ratio (over one order of magnitude lower than NVL-72 and TPUv4), near-zero cross-ToR traffic when node fault ratios under 7%, and improves Model FLOPs Utilization by 3.37x compared to NVIDIA DGX (8 GPUs per Node).</p></details> |  |
| **[On-Device LLM for Context-Aware Wi-Fi Roaming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04174v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Wireless roaming is a critical yet challenging task for maintaining seamless connectivity in dynamic mobile environments. Conventional threshold-based or heuristic schemes often fail, leading to either sticky or excessive handovers. We introduce the first cross-layer use of an on-device large language model (LLM): high-level reasoning in the application layer that issues real-time actions executed in the PHY/MAC stack. The LLM addresses two tasks: (i) context-aware AP selection, where structured prompts fuse environmental cues (e.g., location, time) to choose the best BSSID; and (ii) dynamic threshold adjustment, where the model adaptively decides when to roam. To satisfy the tight latency and resource budgets of edge hardware, we apply a suite of optimizations-chain-of-thought prompting, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and quantization. Experiments on indoor and outdoor datasets show that our approach surpasses legacy heuristics and DRL baselines, achieving a strong balance between roaming stability and signal quality. These findings underscore the promise of application-layer LLM reasoning for lower-layer wireless control in future edge systems.</p></details> |  |

Through preliminary testing on platforms such as ChatGPT, MetaAI, and Grok, we observed that even short, natural prompts could lead to the generation of compromising images ranging from realistic depictions of forged documents to manipulated images of public figures. We introduce Unmasking the Canvas (UTC Benchmark; UTCB), a dynamic and scalable benchmark dataset to evaluate LLM vulnerability in image generation. Our methodology combines structured prompt engineering, multilingual obfuscation (e.g., Zulu, Gaelic, Base64), and evaluation using Groq-hosted LLaMA-3. The pipeline supports both zero-shot and fallback prompting strategies, risk scoring, and automated tagging. All generations are stored with rich metadata and curated into Bronze (non-verified), Silver (LLM-aided verification), and Gold (manually verified) tiers. UTCB is designed to evolve over time with new data sources, prompt templates, and model behaviors. Warning: This paper includes visual examples of adversarial inputs designed to test model safety.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have become widely available and have demonstrated intelligent behaviors in various benchmarks with natural conversation skills. However, their ability to replicate human color-word associations remains understudied. We compared multiple generations of LLMs (from GPT-3 to GPT-4o) against human color-word associations using data collected from over 10,000 Japanese participants, involving 17 colors and 80 words (10 word from eight categories) in Japanese. Our findings reveal a clear progression in LLM performance across generations, with GPT-4o achieving the highest accuracy in predicting the best voted word for each color and category. However, the highest median performance was approximately 50% even for GPT-4o with visual inputs (chance level of 10%). Moreover, we found performance variations across word categories and colors: while LLMs tended to excel in categories such as Rhythm and Landscape, they struggled with categories such as Emotions. Interestingly, color discrimination ability estimated from our color-word association data showed high correlation with human color discrimination patterns, consistent with previous studies. Thus, despite reasonable alignment in basic color discrimination, humans and LLMs still diverge systematically in the words they assign to those colors. Our study highlights both the advancements in LLM capabilities and their persistent limitations, raising the possibility of systematic differences in semantic memory structures between humans and LLMs in representing color-word associations.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

One significant application of LLMs is in tackling software engineering challenges, particularly in resolving real-world tasks on GitHub by fixing code based on the issues reported by the users. However, many current approaches rely on proprietary LLMs, which limits reproducibility, accessibility, and transparency. The critical components of LLMs for addressing software engineering issues and how their capabilities can be effectively enhanced remain unclear. To address these challenges, we introduce SWE-Fixer, a novel open-source framework designed to effectively and efficiently resolve GitHub issues. SWE-Fixer comprises two essential modules: a code file retrieval module and a code editing module. The retrieval module employs BM25 along with a lightweight model to achieve coarse-to-fine file retrieval. Subsequently, the code editing module utilizes the other model to generate patches for the identified files. To mitigate the lack of publicly available datasets, we compile an extensive dataset that includes 110K GitHub issues along with their corresponding patches and train the two models of SWE-Fixer separately. We assess our approach on the SWE-Bench Lite and Verified benchmarks, achieving competitive performance among open-source models with scores of 22.0% and 30.2%. Furthermore, SWE-Fixer reaches state-of-the-art performance (24.7% on Lite and 32.8% on Verified) with PASS_TO_PASS (P2P) filtering. Additionally, our approach requires only two model calls per instance, making it significantly more efficient than existing methods. These results highlight the effectiveness of SWE-Fixer in real-world code-fixing scenarios. We will make our model, dataset, and code publicly available at https://github.com/InternLM/SWE-Fixer.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our c...</summary><p>Our code, data, and model will be released at https://github.com/InternLM/SWE-Fixer</p></details> |

With the prevalence of AI, researchers have identified numerous use cases of AI in network security. However, there are almost nonexistent studies that analyze the suitability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in network security. To fill this gap, we examine the suitability of LLMs in network security, particularly with the case study of STRIDE threat modeling. We utilize four prompting techniques with five LLMs to perform STRIDE classification of 5G threats. From our evaluation results, we point out key findings and detailed insights along with the explanation of the possible underlying factors influencing the behavior of LLMs in the modeling of certain threats. The numerical results and the insights support the necessity for adjusting and fine-tuning LLMs for network security use cases.</p></details> |  |
| **[SceneLLM: Implicit Language Reasoning in LLM for Dynamic Scene Graph Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11026v2)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic scenes contain intricate spatio-temporal information, crucial for mobile robots, UAVs, and autonomous driving systems to make informed decisions. Parsing these scenes into semantic triplets <Subject-Predicate-Object> for accurate Scene Graph Generation (SGG) is highly challenging due to the fluctuating spatio-temporal complexity. Inspired by the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose SceneLLM, a novel framework that leverages LLMs as powerful scene analyzers for dynamic SGG. Our framework introduces a Video-to-Language (V2L) mapping module that transforms video frames into linguistic signals (scene tokens), making the input more comprehensible for LLMs. To better encode spatial information, we devise a Spatial Information Aggregation (SIA) scheme, inspired by the structure of Chinese characters, which encodes spatial data into tokens. Using Optimal Transport (OT), we generate an implicit language signal from the frame-level token sequence that captures the video's spatio-temporal information. To further improve the LLM's ability to process this implicit linguistic input, we apply Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune the model. Finally, we use a transformer-based SGG predictor to decode the LLM's reasoning and predict semantic triplets. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on the Action Genome (AG) benchmark, and extensive experiments show the effectiveness of SceneLLM in understanding and generating accurate dynamic scene graphs.</p></details> | 29 pages, 7 figures |

To address this, we explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating synthetic fall data. This study evaluates text-to-motion (T2M, SATO, ParCo) and text-to-text models (GPT4o, GPT4, Gemini) in simulating realistic fall scenarios. We generate synthetic datasets and integrate them with four real-world baseline datasets to assess their impact on fall detection performance using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. Additionally, we compare LLM-generated synthetic data with a diffusion-based method to evaluate their alignment with real accelerometer distributions. Results indicate that dataset characteristics significantly influence the effectiveness of synthetic data, with LLM-generated data performing best in low-frequency settings (e.g., 20Hz) while showing instability in high-frequency datasets (e.g., 200Hz). While text-to-motion models produce more realistic biomechanical data than text-to-text models, their impact on fall detection varies. Diffusion-based synthetic data demonstrates the closest alignment to real data but does not consistently enhance model performance. An ablation study further confirms that the effectiveness of synthetic data depends on sensor placement and fall representation. These findings provide insights into optimizing synthetic data generation for fall detection models.</p></details> |  |

To address these questions, we introduce a novel classification framework that distinguishes between compute-dependent innovations -- which yield disproportionate benefits at high compute levels (e.g., the Transformer architecture and mixture-of-experts models) and compute-independent innovations, which improve efficiency across all compute scales (e.g., rotary positional encoding, FlashAttention, or layer normalization). We quantify these contributions using a metric called compute-equivalent gain (CEG), which estimates the additional compute that would be required to achieve similar improvements without these algorithmic advancements. To validate this framework, we conduct small-scale training experiments with a scaled-down GPT-2 model. Our results confirm that compute-independent advancements yield meaningful performance gains even in resource-constrained settings, with a CEG of up to $3.5\times$ over a baseline model. By contrast, compute-dependent advancements provided little benefit or even degraded performance at the small scale, reinforcing the importance of compute availability for certain algorithmic gains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advancing and Benchmarking Personalized Tool Invocation for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04072v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tool invocation is a crucial mechanism for extending the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and has recently garnered significant attention. It enables LLMs to solve complex problems through tool calls while accessing up-to-date world knowledge. However, existing work primarily focuses on the fundamental ability of LLMs to invoke tools for problem-solving, without considering personalized constraints in tool invocation. In this work, we introduce the concept of Personalized Tool Invocation and define two key tasks: Tool Preference and Profile-dependent Query. Tool Preference addresses user preferences when selecting among functionally similar tools, while Profile-dependent Query considers cases where a user query lacks certain tool parameters, requiring the model to infer them from the user profile. To tackle these challenges, we propose PTool, a data synthesis framework designed for personalized tool invocation. Additionally, we construct \textbf{PTBench}, the first benchmark for evaluating personalized tool invocation. We then fine-tune various open-source models, demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework and providing valuable insights.

To address this, we propose an integrated framework that combines Large Language Models (LLMs), numerical optimization, and optimization-based control to facilitate efficient subtask learning while ensuring safety against latent risks. The framework decomposes complex tasks into a sequence of context-aware subtasks that account for latent risks. These subtasks and their parameters are then refined through a multi-time-scale process: high-layer multi-turn in-context learning, mid-layer LLM Chain-of-Thought reasoning and numerical optimization, and low-layer model predictive control. The framework iteratively improves decisions by leveraging qualitative feedback and optimized trajectory data from lower-layer optimization processes and a physics simulator. We validate the proposed framework through simulated case studies involving robot arm and autonomous vehicle scenarios. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework can mediate actions based on the context and latent risks and learn complex behaviors efficiently.</p></details> |  |

The unique workload patterns of serving multiple LLMs (i.e., multi-LLM serving) create new opportunities and challenges for this task. The long-tail popularity of models and their long idle periods present opportunities to improve utilization through GPU sharing. However, existing GPU sharing systems lack the ability to adjust their resource allocation and sharing policies at runtime, making them ineffective at meeting latency service-level objectives (SLOs) under rapidly fluctuating workloads. This paper presents Prism, a multi-LLM serving system that unleashes the full potential of GPU sharing to achieve both cost efficiency and SLO attainment. At its core, Prism tackles a key limitation of existing systems$\unicode{x2014}$the lack of $\textit{cross-model memory coordination}$, which is essential for flexibly sharing GPU memory across models under dynamic workloads. Prism achieves this with two key designs. First, it supports on-demand memory allocation by dynamically mapping physical to virtual memory pages, allowing flexible memory redistribution among models that space- and time-share a GPU. Second, it improves memory efficiency through a two-level scheduling policy that dynamically adjusts sharing strategies based on models' runtime demands. Evaluations on real-world traces show that Prism achieves more than $2\times$ cost savings and $3.3\times$ SLO attainment compared to state-of-the-art systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Universal and Black-Box Query-Response Only Attack on LLMs with QROA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02044v3)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has exposed critical security and ethical vulnerabilities, particularly their susceptibility to adversarial manipulations. This paper introduces QROA, a novel black-box jailbreak method designed to identify adversarial suffixes that can bypass LLM alignment safeguards when appended to a malicious instruction. Unlike existing suffix-based jailbreak approaches, QROA does not require access to the model's logit or any other internal information. It also eliminates reliance on human-crafted templates, operating solely through the standard query-response interface of LLMs. By framing the attack as an optimization bandit problem, QROA employs a surrogate model and token level optimization to efficiently explore suffix variations. Furthermore, we propose QROA-UNV, an extension that identifies universal adversarial suffixes for individual models, enabling one-query jailbreaks across a wide range of instructions. Testing on multiple models demonstrates Attack Success Rate (ASR) greater than 80\%. These findings highlight critical vulnerabilities, emphasize the need for advanced defenses, and contribute to the development of more robust safety evaluations for secure AI deployment.

However, the conventional approach of prompting LLM optimizer with the whole training trajectories on training dataset in a single pass becomes untenable as datasets grow, leading to context window overflow and degraded pattern recognition. To address these challenges, we propose Fine-Grained Optimization (FGO), a scalable framework that divides large optimization tasks into manageable subsets, performs targeted optimizations, and systematically combines optimized components through progressive merging. Evaluation across ALFWorld, LogisticsQA, and GAIA benchmarks demonstrate that FGO outperforms existing approaches by 1.6-8.6% while reducing average prompt token consumption by 56.3%. Our framework provides a practical solution for scaling up LLM-based optimization of increasingly sophisticated agent systems. Further analysis demonstrates that FGO achieves the most consistent performance gain in all training dataset sizes, showcasing its scalability and efficiency.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce WebGen-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to measure an LLM-based agent's ability to create multi-file website codebases from scratch. It contains diverse instructions for website generation, created through the combined efforts of human annotators and GPT-4o. These instructions span three major categories and thirteen minor categories, encompassing nearly all important types of web applications. To assess the quality of the generated websites, we use GPT-4o to generate test cases targeting each functionality described in the instructions, and then manually filter, adjust, and organize them to ensure accuracy, resulting in 647 test cases. Each test case specifies an operation to be performed on the website and the expected result after the operation. To automate testing and improve reproducibility, we employ a powerful web-navigation agent to execute tests on the generated websites and determine whether the observed responses align with the expected results. We evaluate three high-performance code-agent frameworks, Bolt.diy, OpenHands, and Aider, using multiple proprietary and open-source LLMs as engines. The best-performing combination, Bolt.diy powered by DeepSeek-R1, achieves only 27.8\% accuracy on the test cases, highlighting the challenging nature of our benchmark. Additionally, we construct WebGen-Instruct, a training set consisting of 6,667 website-generation instructions. Training Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct on Bolt.diy trajectories generated from a subset of this training set achieves an accuracy of 38.2\%, surpassing the performance of the best proprietary model.</p></details> |  |

LLM-empowered chatbots have shown great promise in Healthcare Q&A tasks, offering the potential to provide quick and accurate responses to medical inquiries. Our main objective was the development and preliminary assessment of an LLM-empowered chatbot software capable of reliably answering clinical guideline questions using University College London Hospital (UCLH) clinical guidelines. Methods: We used the open-weight Llama-3.1-8B LLM to extract relevant information from the UCLH guidelines to answer questions. Our approach highlights the safety and reliability of referencing information over its interpretation and response generation. Seven doctors from the ward assessed the chatbot's performance by comparing its answers to the gold standard. Results: Our chatbot demonstrates promising performance in terms of relevance, with ~73% of its responses rated as very relevant, showcasing a strong understanding of the clinical context. Importantly, our chatbot achieves a recall of 1.00 for extracted guideline lines, substantially minimising the risk of missing critical information. Approximately 78% of responses were rated satisfactory in terms of completeness. A small portion (~14.5%) contained minor unnecessary information, indicating occasional lapses in precision. The chatbot' showed high efficiency, with an average completion time of 10 seconds, compared to 30 seconds for human respondents. Evaluation of clinical reasoning showed that 72% of the chatbot's responses were without flaws. Our chatbot demonstrates significant potential to speed up and improve the process of accessing locally relevant clinical information for healthcare professionals.</p></details> |  |

Existing optimization efforts for MoE models have focused primarily on coarse-grained MoE architectures. With the emergence of DeepSeek Models, fine-grained MoE models are gaining popularity, yet research on them remains limited. Therefore, we want to discuss the efficiency dynamic under different service loads. Additionally, fine-grained models allow deployers to reduce the number of routed experts, both activated counts and total counts, raising the question of how this reduction affects the trade-off between MoE efficiency and performance. Our findings indicate that while deploying MoE models presents greater challenges, it also offers significant optimization opportunities. Reducing the number of activated experts can lead to substantial efficiency improvements in certain scenarios, with only minor performance degradation. Reducing the total number of experts provides limited efficiency gains but results in severe performance degradation. Our method can increase throughput by at least 10\% without any performance degradation. Overall, we conclude that MoE inference optimization remains an area with substantial potential for exploration and improvement.</p></details> |  |

Existing framework based on ELO rating system suffers from the inevitable instability problem due to ranking inconsistency and the lack of attention to the varying abilities of annotators. In this paper, we introduce a novel stable arena framework to address these issues by enhancing the ELO Rating System. Specifically, we replace the iterative update method with a Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) approach, m-ELO, and provide theoretical proof of the consistency and stability of the MLE approach for model ranking. Additionally, we proposed the am-ELO, which modify the Elo Rating's probability function to incorporate annotator abilities, enabling the simultaneous estimation of model scores and annotator reliability. Experiments demonstrate that this method ensures stability, proving that this framework offers a more robust, accurate, and stable evaluation method for LLMs.</p></details> | ICML2025 Accepted |

Thanks to their deep contextual understanding capabilities, LLMs offer a new perspective to tackle EL, promising better results than traditional methods. Despite the impressive generalization capabilities of LLMs, linking less popular, long-tail entities remains challenging as these entities are often underrepresented in training data and knowledge bases. Furthermore, the long-tail EL task is an understudied problem, and limited studies address it with LLMs. In the present work, we assess the performance of two popular LLMs, GPT and LLama3, in a long-tail entity linking scenario. Using MHERCL v0.1, a manually annotated benchmark of sentences from domain-specific historical texts, we quantitatively compare the performance of LLMs in identifying and linking entities to their corresponding Wikidata entries against that of ReLiK, a state-of-the-art Entity Linking and Relation Extraction framework. Our preliminary experiments reveal that LLMs perform encouragingly well in long-tail EL, indicating that this technology can be a valuable adjunct in filling the gap between head and long-tail EL.</p></details> |  |

Numerous studies have explored this topic, proposing various promising approaches. Inspired by the significant advances in machine learning in recent years, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), which have demonstrated their ability to tackle various tasks, this paper revisits cross-lingual code clone detection. We evaluate the performance of five (05) LLMs and eight prompts (08) for the identification of cross-lingual code clones. Additionally, we compare these results against two baseline methods. Finally, we evaluate a pre-trained embedding model to assess the effectiveness of the generated representations for classifying clone and non-clone pairs. The studies involving LLMs and Embedding models are evaluated using two widely used cross-lingual datasets, XLCoST and CodeNet. Our results show that LLMs can achieve high F1 scores, up to 0.99, for straightforward programming examples. However, they not only perform less well on programs associated with complex programming challenges but also do not necessarily understand the meaning of "code clones" in a cross-lingual setting. We show that embedding models used to represent code fragments from different programming languages in the same representation space enable the training of a basic classifier that outperforms all LLMs by ~1 and ~20 percentage points on the XLCoST and CodeNet datasets, respectively. This finding suggests that, despite the apparent capabilities of LLMs, embeddings provided by embedding models offer suitable representations to achieve state-of-the-art performance in cross-lingual code clone detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the ACM International Conference on the Foundations of Software Engineering (FSE) 2025</p></details> |
| **[Procedural Memory Is Not All You Need: Bridging Cognitive Gaps in LLM-Based Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03434v1)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a landmark achievement in Artificial Intelligence (AI), demonstrating unprecedented proficiency in procedural tasks such as text generation, code completion, and conversational coherence. These capabilities stem from their architecture, which mirrors human procedural memory -- the brain's ability to automate repetitive, pattern-driven tasks through practice. However, as LLMs are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, it becomes impossible to ignore their limitations operating in complex, unpredictable environments. This paper argues that LLMs, while transformative, are fundamentally constrained by their reliance on procedural memory. To create agents capable of navigating ``wicked'' learning environments -- where rules shift, feedback is ambiguous, and novelty is the norm -- we must augment LLMs with semantic memory and associative learning systems. By adopting a modular architecture that decouples these cognitive functions, we can bridge the gap between narrow procedural expertise and the adaptive intelligence required for real-world problem-solving.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the workshop on Hybrid AI for Human-Centric Personalization (HyPer), co-located with ACM UMAP '25</p></details> |

The system utilizes Llama 3.2-3B-Instruct as its foundation model. By embedding and retrieving context-relevant healthcare information, the system significantly improves response accuracy. QLoRA facilitates notable parameter efficiency and memory optimization, preserving the integrity of medical information through specialized quantization techniques. Our research also shows that our model performs relatively well on various medical benchmarks, indicating that it can be used to make basic medical suggestions. This paper details the system's technical components, including its architecture, quantization methods, and key healthcare applications such as enhanced disease prediction from patient symptoms and medical history, treatment suggestions, and efficient summarization of complex medical reports. We touch on the ethical considerations-patient privacy, data security, and the need for rigorous clinical validation-as well as the practical challenges of integrating such systems into real-world healthcare workflows. Furthermore, the lightweight quantized weights ensure scalability and ease of deployment even in low-resource hospital environments. Finally, the paper concludes with an analysis of the broader impact of LLMs on healthcare and outlines future directions for LLMs in medical settings.</p></details> | 12 pages |
| **[Elevating Cyber Threat Intelligence against Disinformation Campaigns with LLM-based Concept Extraction and the FakeCTI Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03345v1)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The swift spread of fake news and disinformation campaigns poses a significant threat to public trust, political stability, and cybersecurity. Traditional Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) approaches, which rely on low-level indicators such as domain names and social media handles, are easily evaded by adversaries who frequently modify their online infrastructure. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel CTI framework that focuses on high-level, semantic indicators derived from recurrent narratives and relationships of disinformation campaigns. Our approach extracts structured CTI indicators from unstructured disinformation content, capturing key entities and their contextual dependencies within fake news using Large Language Models (LLMs). We further introduce FakeCTI, the first dataset that systematically links fake news to disinformation campaigns and threat actors. To evaluate the effectiveness of our CTI framework, we analyze multiple fake news attribution techniques, spanning from traditional Natural Language Processing (NLP) to fine-tuned LLMs. This work shifts the focus from low-level artifacts to persistent conceptual structures, establishing a scalable and adaptive approach to tracking and countering disinformation campaigns.</p></details> |  |

However, ensuring they do not recommend out-of-domain (OOD) items remains a challenge. We study two distinct methods to address this issue: RecLM-ret, a retrieval-based method, and RecLM-cgen, a constrained generation method. Both methods integrate seamlessly with existing LLMs to ensure in-domain recommendations. Comprehensive experiments on three recommendation datasets demonstrate that RecLM-cgen consistently outperforms RecLM-ret and existing LLM-based recommender models in accuracy while eliminating OOD recommendations, making it the preferred method for adoption. Additionally, RecLM-cgen maintains strong generalist capabilities and is a lightweight plug-and-play module for easy integration into LLMs, offering valuable practical benefits for the community.

Existing evaluations are limited by the static assessment that focuses on knowledge tests, the single perspective that centers on user experience, and the open-loop framework that lacks actionable feedback. To address these issues, we propose {\Psi}-Arena, an interactive framework for comprehensive assessment and optimization of LLM-based counselors, featuring three key characteristics: (1) Realistic arena interactions that simulate real-world counseling through multi-stage dialogues with psychologically profiled NPC clients, (2) Tripartite evaluation that integrates assessments from the client, counselor, and supervisor perspectives, and (3) Closed-loop optimization that iteratively improves LLM counselors using diagnostic feedback. Experiments across eight state-of-the-art LLMs show significant performance variations in different real-world scenarios and evaluation perspectives. Moreover, reflection-based optimization results in up to a 141% improvement in counseling performance. We hope PsychoArena provides a foundational resource for advancing reliable and human-aligned LLM applications in mental healthcare.</p></details> | in progress |

This paper describes the design, deployment, and evaluation of ASHABot, an LLM-powered, experts-in-the-loop, WhatsApp-based chatbot to address the information needs of CHWs in India. Through interviews with CHWs and their supervisors and log analysis, we examine factors affecting their engagement with ASHABot, and ASHABot's role in addressing CHWs' informational needs. We found that ASHABot provided a private channel for CHWs to ask rudimentary and sensitive questions they hesitated to ask supervisors. CHWs trusted the information they received on ASHABot and treated it as an authoritative resource. CHWs' supervisors expanded their knowledge by contributing answers to questions ASHABot failed to answer, but were concerned about demands on their workload and increased accountability. We emphasize positioning LLMs as supplemental fallible resources within the community healthcare ecosystem, instead of as replacements for supervisor support.</p></details> |  |

We introduce RAG-MCP, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework that overcomes this challenge by offloading tool discovery. RAG-MCP uses semantic retrieval to identify the most relevant MCP(s) for a given query from an external index before engaging the LLM. Only the selected tool descriptions are passed to the model, drastically reducing prompt size and simplifying decision-making. Experiments, including an MCP stress test, demonstrate RAG-MCP significantly cuts prompt tokens (e.g., by over 50%) and more than triples tool selection accuracy (43.13% vs 13.62% baseline) on benchmark tasks. RAG-MCP enables scalable and accurate tool integration for LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Leveraging ensemble learning principles, we introduce an Ensemble Multi-Objective RL (EMORL) framework that fine-tunes multiple models with individual objectives while optimizing their aggregation after the training to improve efficiency and flexibility. Our method is the first to aggregate the last hidden states of individual models, incorporating contextual information from multiple objectives. This approach is supported by a hierarchical grid search algorithm that identifies optimal weighted combinations. We evaluate EMORL on counselor reflection generation tasks, using text-scoring LLMs to evaluate the generations and provide rewards during RL fine-tuning. Through comprehensive experiments on the PAIR and Psych8k datasets, we demonstrate the advantages of EMORL against existing baselines: significantly lower and more stable training consumption ($17,529\pm 1,650$ data points and $6,573\pm 147.43$ seconds), improved scalability and explainability, and comparable performance across multiple objectives.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 9 figures, submitted to SIGDIAL 2025 conference</p></details> |
| **[A Trustworthy Multi-LLM Network: Challenges,Solutions, and A Use Case](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03196v1)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong potential across a variety of tasks in communications and networking due to their advanced reasoning capabilities. However, because different LLMs have different model structures and are trained using distinct corpora and methods, they may offer varying optimization strategies for the same network issues. Moreover, the limitations of an individual LLM's training data, aggravated by the potential maliciousness of its hosting device, can result in responses with low confidence or even bias. To address these challenges, we propose a blockchain-enabled collaborative framework that connects multiple LLMs into a Trustworthy Multi-LLM Network (MultiLLMN). This architecture enables the cooperative evaluation and selection of the most reliable and high-quality responses to complex network optimization problems. Specifically, we begin by reviewing related work and highlighting the limitations of existing LLMs in collaboration and trust, emphasizing the need for trustworthiness in LLM-based systems. We then introduce the workflow and design of the proposed Trustworthy MultiLLMN framework. Given the severity of False Base Station (FBS) attacks in B5G and 6G communication systems and the difficulty of addressing such threats through traditional modeling techniques, we present FBS defense as a case study to empirically validate the effectiveness of our approach. Finally, we outline promising future research directions in this emerging area.</p></details> |  |

We examine two representative tasks-phishing email detection and intrusion detection-that differ in data modality, cognitive complexity, and user familiarity. Through a controlled mixed-methods user study, n = 58 (phishing, n = 34; intrusion, n = 24), we find that human-AI collaboration improves task performance,reducing false positives in phishing detection and false negatives in intrusion detection. A learning effect is also observed when participants transition from collaboration to independent work, suggesting that LLMs can support long-term skill development. Our qualitative analysis shows that interaction dynamics-such as LLM definitiveness, explanation style, and tone-influence user trust, prompting strategies, and decision revision. Users engaged in more analytic questioning and showed greater reliance on LLM feedback in high-complexity settings. These results provide design guidance for building interpretable, adaptive, and trustworthy human-AI teaming systems, and demonstrate that LLMs can meaningfully support non-experts in reasoning through complex cybersecurity problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 10 figures, 2 tables, under review</p></details> |

In comparison, combinatorics remains a challenging domain, characterized by a lack of appropriate benchmarks and theorem libraries. To address this gap, we introduce CombiBench, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 100 combinatorial problems, each formalized in Lean~4 and paired with its corresponding informal statement. The problem set covers a wide spectrum of difficulty levels, ranging from middle school to IMO and university level, and span over ten combinatorial topics. CombiBench is suitable for testing IMO solving capabilities since it includes all IMO combinatorial problems since 2000 (except IMO 2004 P3 as its statement contain an images). Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive and standardized evaluation framework, dubbed Fine-Eval (for $\textbf{F}$ill-in-the-blank $\textbf{in}$ L$\textbf{e}$an Evaluation), for formal mathematics. It accommodates not only proof-based problems but also, for the first time, the evaluation of fill-in-the-blank questions. Using Fine-Eval as the evaluation method and Kimina Lean Server as the backend, we benchmark several LLMs on CombiBench and observe that their capabilities for formally solving combinatorial problems remain limited. Among all models tested (none of which has been trained for this particular task), Kimina-Prover attains the best results, solving 7 problems (out of 100) under both ``with solution'' and ``without solution'' scenarios. We open source the benchmark dataset alongside with the code of the proposed evaluation method at https://github.com/MoonshotAI/CombiBench/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Social Opinions Prediction Utilizes Fusing Dynamics Equation with LLM-based Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08717v4)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the context where social media emerges as a pivotal platform for social movements and shaping public opinion, accurately simulating and predicting the dynamics of user opinions is of significant importance. Such insights are vital for understanding social phenomena, informing policy decisions, and guiding public opinion. Unfortunately, traditional algorithms based on idealized models and disregarding social data often fail to capture the complexity and nuance of real-world social interactions. This study proposes the Fusing Dynamics Equation-Large Language Model (FDE-LLM) algorithm. This innovative approach aligns the actions and evolution of opinions in Large Language Models (LLMs) with the real-world data on social networks. The FDE-LLM devides users into two roles: opinion leaders and followers. Opinion leaders use LLM for role-playing and employ Cellular Automata(CA) to constrain opinion changes. In contrast, opinion followers are integrated into a dynamic system that combines the CA model with the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model. This innovative design significantly improves the accuracy of the simulation. Our experiments utilized four real-world datasets from Weibo. The result demonstrates that the FDE-LLM significantly outperforms traditional Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) algorithms and LLM-based algorithms. Additionally, our algorithm accurately simulates the decay and recovery of opinions over time, underscoring LLMs potential to revolutionize the understanding of social media dynamics.</p></details> |  |

However, AMC remains challenging due to the complex interplay of signal interference and noise. In this work, we propose an innovative framework that integrates traditional signal processing techniques with Large-Language Models (LLMs) to address AMC. Our approach leverages higher-order statistics and cumulant estimation to convert quantitative signal features into structured natural language prompts. By incorporating exemplar contexts into these prompts, our method exploits the LLM's inherent familiarity with classical signal processing, enabling effective one-shot classification without additional training or preprocessing (e.g., denoising). Experimental evaluations on synthetically generated datasets, spanning both noiseless and noisy conditions, demonstrate that our framework achieves competitive performance across diverse modulation schemes and Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs). Moreover, our approach paves the way for robust foundation models in wireless communications across varying channel conditions, significantly reducing the expense associated with developing channel-specific models. This work lays the foundation for scalable, interpretable, and versatile signal classification systems in next-generation wireless networks.

While prior research has largely centered on case studies and examples demonstrating how LLMs can assist forensic investigations, deeper explorations remain limited, i.e., a standardized approach for precise performance evaluations is lacking. Inspired by the NIST Computer Forensic Tool Testing Program, this paper proposes a standardized methodology to quantitatively evaluate the application of LLMs for digital forensic tasks, specifically in timeline analysis. The paper describes the components of the methodology, including the dataset, timeline generation, and ground truth development. Additionally, the paper recommends using BLEU and ROUGE metrics for the quantitative evaluation of LLMs through case studies or tasks involving timeline analysis. Experimental results using ChatGPT demonstrate that the proposed methodology can effectively evaluate LLM-based forensic timeline analysis. Finally, we discuss the limitations of applying LLMs to forensic timeline analysis.</p></details> |  |

LLM-MAS can potentially improve a wide range of tasks, from answering questions and generating content to automating customer support and improving decision-making processes. However, LLM-MAS in production or preproduction environments can be vulnerable to emergent errors or disruptions, such as hallucinations, agent failures, and agent communication failures. This study proposes a chaos engineering framework to proactively identify such vulnerabilities in LLM-MAS, assess and build resilience against them, and ensure reliable performance in critical applications.</p></details> |  |

Specifications for such systems are often standardized in natural language documents, like Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) specifications or IETF RFC's. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in both generating tests and handling large volumes of natural language text, making them well-suited for analyzing artifacts like specification documents, bug reports, and code implementations. In this work, we leverage natural language and code artifacts to guide LLMs to generate targeted tests that highlight meaningful behavioral differences between implementations, including those corresponding to bugs. We introduce DiffSpec, a framework for generating differential tests with LLMs using prompt chaining. We demonstrate DiffSpec's efficacy on two different (extensively tested) systems, eBPF runtimes and Wasm validators. Using DiffSpec, we generated 1901 differentiating tests, uncovering at least four distinct and confirmed bugs in eBPF, including a kernel memory leak, inconsistent behavior in jump instructions, undefined behavior when using the stack pointer, and tests with infinite loops that hang the verifier in ebpf-for-windows. We also found 299 differentiating tests in Wasm validators pointing to two confirmed and fixed bugs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Model Alignment Through Collective Intelligence of Open-Source LLMS](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03059v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building helpful and harmless large language models (LLMs) requires effective model alignment approach based on human instructions and feedback, which necessitates high-quality human-labeled data. Constructing such datasets is often expensive and hard to scale, and may face potential limitations on diversity and generalization. To address these challenges, we introduce Mixture of Agents Alignment (MoAA), that leverages the collective strengths of various language models to provide high-quality data for model alignment. By employing MoAA, we enhance both supervised fine-tuning and preference optimization, leading to improved performance compared to using a single model alone to generate alignment data (e.g. using GPT-4o alone). Evaluation results show that our approach can improve win rate of LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct from 19.5 to 48.3 on Arena-Hard and from 22.33 to 57.23 on AlpacaEval2, highlighting a promising direction for model alignment through this new scalable and diverse synthetic data recipe. Furthermore, we demonstrate that MoAA enables a self-improvement pipeline, where models finetuned on MoA-generated data surpass their own initial capabilities, providing evidence that our approach can push the frontier of open-source LLMs without reliance on stronger external supervision. Data and code will be released.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |

Recent developments demonstrate that the latest class of models are able to integrate structured and unstructured data, assist in hypothesis generation, and streamline research workflows. To explore the frontier of LLM capabilities across the research lifecycle, we review applications of LLMs through 34 total projects developed during the second annual Large Language Model Hackathon for Applications in Materials Science and Chemistry, a global hybrid event. These projects spanned seven key research areas: (1) molecular and material property prediction, (2) molecular and material design, (3) automation and novel interfaces, (4) scientific communication and education, (5) research data management and automation, (6) hypothesis generation and evaluation, and (7) knowledge extraction and reasoning from the scientific literature. Collectively, these applications illustrate how LLMs serve as versatile predictive models, platforms for rapid prototyping of domain-specific tools, and much more. In particular, improvements in both open source and proprietary LLM performance through the addition of reasoning, additional training data, and new techniques have expanded effectiveness, particularly in low-data environments and interdisciplinary research. As LLMs continue to improve, their integration into scientific workflows presents both new opportunities and new challenges, requiring ongoing exploration, continued refinement, and further research to address reliability, interpretability, and reproducibility.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2411.15221</p></details> |

This paper describes the UCSC system submission to the shared Mu-SHROOM task. We introduce a framework that first retrieves relevant context, next identifies false content from the answer, and finally maps them back to spans in the LLM output. The process is further enhanced by automatically optimizing prompts. Our system achieves the highest overall performance, ranking #1 in average position across all languages.

LLaSA supports conversational, context-aware reasoning - explaining the causes of sensor-detected behaviors and answering free-form questions in real-world scenarios. It is tuned for scientific accuracy, coherence, and response reliability. To advance this new task of sensor-based QA, we release three large-scale datasets: SensorCaps, OpenSQA, and Tune-OpenSQA. Together, these resources define a new benchmark for sensor-language models. LLaSA consistently produces interpretable, causal answers and outperforms commercial LLMs across both public and real-world settings.

Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), a key AM technology, enables the creation of highly customized, cost-effective products with minimal material waste through layer-by-layer extrusion, posing a significant challenge to traditional subtractive methods. However, the susceptibility of material extrusion techniques to errors often requires expert intervention to detect and mitigate defects that can severely compromise product quality. While automated error detection and machine learning models exist, their generalizability across diverse 3D printer setups, firmware, and sensors is limited, and deep learning methods require extensive labeled datasets, hindering scalability and adaptability. To address these challenges, we present a process monitoring and control framework that leverages pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) alongside 3D printers to detect and address printing defects. The LLM evaluates print quality by analyzing images captured after each layer or print segment, identifying failure modes and querying the printer for relevant parameters. It then generates and executes a corrective action plan. We validated the effectiveness of the proposed framework in identifying defects by comparing it against a control group of engineers with diverse AM expertise. Our evaluation demonstrated that LLM-based agents not only accurately identify common 3D printing errors, such as inconsistent extrusion, stringing, warping, and layer adhesion, but also effectively determine the parameters causing these failures and autonomously correct them without any need for human intervention.</p></details> |  |
| **[Firewalls to Secure Dynamic LLM Agentic Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01822v3)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Future LLM agents are likely to communicate on behalf of users with other entity-representing agents on tasks that entail long-horizon plans with interdependent goals. Current work does not focus on such agentic networks, nor does it address their challenges. Thus, we first identify the required properties of agents' communication, which should be proactive and adaptable. It needs to satisfy 1) privacy: agents should not share more than what is needed for the task, and 2) security: the communication must preserve integrity and maintain utility against selfish entities. We design a use case (travel planning) as a testbed that exemplifies these requirements, and we show examples of how this can go wrong. Next, we propose a practical design, inspired by established network security principles, for constrained LLM agentic networks that balance adaptability, security, and privacy. Our framework automatically constructs and updates task-specific rules from prior simulations to build firewalls. We offer layers of defense to 1) convert free-form input to a task-specific protocol, 2) dynamically abstract users' data to a task-specific degree of permissiveness, and 3) self-correct the agents' trajectory.</p></details> |  |

Detecting LLM Memorization through Input Perturbation Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03019v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance through training on massive datasets, they can exhibit concerning behaviors such as verbatim reproduction of training data rather than true generalization. This memorization phenomenon raises significant concerns about data privacy, intellectual property rights, and the reliability of model evaluations. This paper introduces PEARL, a novel approach for detecting memorization in LLMs. PEARL assesses how sensitive an LLM's performance is to input perturbations, enabling memorization detection without requiring access to the model's internals. We investigate how input perturbations affect the consistency of outputs, enabling us to distinguish between true generalization and memorization. Our findings, following extensive experiments on the Pythia open model, provide a robust framework for identifying when the model simply regurgitates learned information. Applied on the GPT 4o models, the PEARL framework not only identified cases of memorization of classic texts from the Bible or common code from HumanEval but also demonstrated that it can provide supporting evidence that some data, such as from the New York Times news articles, were likely part of the training data of a given model.</p></details> |  |

Publishing incentives encourage researchers to present "positive" findings, even when empirical results are equivocal. Consequently, it is well-documented that authors often spin study results, especially in article abstracts. Such spin can influence clinician interpretation of evidence and may affect patient care decisions. In this study, we ask whether the interpretation of trial results offered by Large Language Models (LLMs) is similarly affected by spin. This is important since LLMs are increasingly being used to trawl through and synthesize published medical evidence. We evaluated 22 LLMs and found that they are across the board more susceptible to spin than humans. They might also propagate spin into their outputs: We find evidence, e.g., that LLMs implicitly incorporate spin into plain language summaries that they generate. We also find, however, that LLMs are generally capable of recognizing spin, and can be prompted in a way to mitigate spin's impact on LLM outputs.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 12 figures, 4 tables, CHIL 2025</p></details> |
