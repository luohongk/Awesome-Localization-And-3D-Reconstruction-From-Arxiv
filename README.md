| **[Survey on Monocular Metric Depth Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11841v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) is a fundamental computer vision task underpinning applications such as spatial understanding, 3D reconstruction, and autonomous driving. While deep learning-based MDE methods can predict relative depth from a single image, their lack of metric scale information often results in scale inconsistencies, limiting their utility in downstream tasks like visual SLAM, 3D reconstruction, and novel view synthesis. Monocular Metric Depth Estimation (MMDE) addresses these challenges by enabling precise, scene-scale depth inference. MMDE improves depth consistency, enhances sequential task stability, simplifies integration into downstream applications, and broadens practical use cases. This paper provides a comprehensive review of depth estimation technologies, highlighting the evolution from geometry-based methods to state-of-the-art deep learning approaches. It emphasizes advancements in scale-agnostic methods, which are crucial for enabling zero-shot generalization as the foundational capability for MMDE. Recent progress in zero-shot MMDE research is explored, focusing on challenges such as model generalization and the loss of detail at scene boundaries. Innovative strategies to address these issues include unlabelled data augmentation, image patching, architectural optimization, and generative techniques. These advancements, analyzed in detail, demonstrate significant contributions to overcoming existing limitations. Finally, this paper synthesizes recent developments in zero-shot MMDE, identifies unresolved challenges, and outlines future research directions. By offering a clear roadmap and cutting-edge insights, this work aims to deepen understanding of MMDE, inspire novel applications, and drive technological innovation.</p></details> |  |
| **[AutoLoop: Fast Visual SLAM Fine-tuning through Agentic Curriculum Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09160v1)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current visual SLAM systems face significant challenges in balancing computational efficiency with robust loop closure handling. Traditional approaches require careful manual tuning and incur substantial computational overhead, while learning-based methods either lack explicit loop closure capabilities or implement them through computationally expensive methods. We present AutoLoop, a novel approach that combines automated curriculum learning with efficient fine-tuning for visual SLAM systems. Our method employs a DDPG (Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient) agent to dynamically adjust loop closure weights during training, eliminating the need for manual hyperparameter search while significantly reducing the required training steps. The approach pre-computes potential loop closure pairs offline and leverages them through an agent-guided curriculum, allowing the model to adapt efficiently to new scenarios. Experiments conducted on TartanAir for training and validated across multiple benchmarks including KITTI, EuRoC, ICL-NUIM and TUM RGB-D demonstrate that AutoLoop achieves comparable or superior performance while reducing training time by an order of magnitude compared to traditional approaches. AutoLoop provides a practical solution for rapid adaptation of visual SLAM systems, automating the weight tuning process that traditionally requires multiple manual iterations. Our results show that this automated curriculum strategy not only accelerates training but also maintains or improves the model's performance across diverse environmental conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Organizing Edge Computing Distribution Framework for Visual SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08629v1)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Localization within a known environment is a crucial capability for mobile robots. Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is a prominent solution to this problem. SLAM is a framework that consists of a diverse set of computational tasks ranging from real-time tracking to computation-intensive map optimization. This combination can present a challenge for resource-limited mobile robots. Previously, edge-assisted SLAM methods have demonstrated promising real-time execution capabilities by offloading heavy computations while performing real-time tracking onboard. However, the common approach of utilizing a client-server architecture for offloading is sensitive to server and network failures. In this article, we propose a novel edge-assisted SLAM framework capable of self-organizing fully distributed SLAM execution across a network of devices or functioning on a single device without connectivity. The architecture consists of three layers and is designed to be device-agnostic, resilient to network failures, and minimally invasive to the core SLAM system. We have implemented and demonstrated the framework for monocular ORB SLAM3 and evaluated it in both fully distributed and standalone SLAM configurations against the ORB SLAM3. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed design matches the accuracy and resource utilization of the monolithic approach while enabling collaborative execution.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Towards Revisiting Visual Place Recognition for Joining Submaps in Multimap SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12408v2)** | 2025-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual SLAM is a key technology for many autonomous systems. However, tracking loss can lead to the creation of disjoint submaps in multimap SLAM systems like ORB-SLAM3. Because of that, these systems employ submap merging strategies. As we show, these strategies are not always successful. In this paper, we investigate the impact of using modern VPR approaches for submap merging in visual SLAM. We argue that classical evaluation metrics are not sufficient to estimate the impact of a modern VPR component on the overall system. We show that naively replacing the VPR component does not leverage its full potential without requiring substantial interference in the original system. Because of that, we present a post-processing pipeline along with a set of metrics that allow us to estimate the impact of modern VPR components. We evaluate our approach on the NCLT and Newer College datasets using ORB-SLAM3 with NetVLAD and HDC-DELF as VPR components. Additionally, we present a simple approach for combining VPR with temporal consistency for map merging. We show that the map merging performance of ORB-SLAM3 can be improved. Building on these results, researchers in VPR can assess the potential of their approaches for SLAM systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at TAROS 2024.

| **[Drift-free Visual SLAM using Digital Twins](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08496v2)** | 2024-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Globally-consistent localization in urban environments is crucial for autonomous systems such as self-driving vehicles and drones, as well as assistive technologies for visually impaired people. Traditional Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) and Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (VSLAM) methods, though adequate for local pose estimation, suffer from drift in the long term due to reliance on local sensor data. While GPS counteracts this drift, it is unavailable indoors and often unreliable in urban areas. An alternative is to localize the camera to an existing 3D map using visual-feature matching. This can provide centimeter-level accurate localization but is limited by the visual similarities between the current view and the map. This paper introduces a novel approach that achieves accurate and globally-consistent localization by aligning the sparse 3D point cloud generated by the VIO/VSLAM system to a digital twin using point-to-plane matching; no visual data association is needed. The proposed method provides a 6-DoF global measurement tightly integrated into the VIO/VSLAM system. Experiments run on a high-fidelity GPS simulator and real-world data collected from a drone demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art VIO-GPS systems and offers superior robustness against viewpoint changes compared to the state-of-the-art Visual SLAM systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[MegaSaM: Accurate, Fast, and Robust Structure and Motion from Casual Dynamic Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04463v2)** | 2024-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a system that allows for accurate, fast, and robust estimation of camera parameters and depth maps from casual monocular videos of dynamic scenes. Most conventional structure from motion and monocular SLAM techniques assume input videos that feature predominantly static scenes with large amounts of parallax. Such methods tend to produce erroneous estimates in the absence of these conditions. Recent neural network-based approaches attempt to overcome these challenges; however, such methods are either computationally expensive or brittle when run on dynamic videos with uncontrolled camera motion or unknown field of view. We demonstrate the surprising effectiveness of a deep visual SLAM framework: with careful modifications to its training and inference schemes, this system can scale to real-world videos of complex dynamic scenes with unconstrained camera paths, including videos with little camera parallax. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real videos demonstrate that our system is significantly more accurate and robust at camera pose and depth estimation when compared with prior and concurrent work, with faster or comparable running times.

| **[MCVO: A Generic Visual Odometry for Arbitrarily Arranged Multi-Cameras](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03146v1)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Making multi-camera visual SLAM systems easier to set up and more robust to the environment is always one of the focuses of vision robots. Existing monocular and binocular vision SLAM systems have narrow FoV and are fragile in textureless environments with degenerated accuracy and limited robustness. Thus multi-camera SLAM systems are gaining attention because they can provide redundancy for texture degeneration with wide FoV. However, current multi-camera SLAM systems face massive data processing pressure and elaborately designed camera configurations, leading to estimation failures for arbitrarily arranged multi-camera systems. To address these problems, we propose a generic visual odometry for arbitrarily arranged multi-cameras, which can achieve metric-scale state estimation with high flexibility in the cameras' arrangement. Specifically, we first design a learning-based feature extraction and tracking framework to shift the pressure of CPU processing of multiple video streams. Then we use the rigid constraints between cameras to estimate the metric scale poses for robust SLAM system initialization. Finally, we fuse the features of the multi-cameras in the SLAM back-end to achieve robust pose estimation and online scale optimization. Additionally, multi-camera features help improve the loop detection for pose graph optimization. Experiments on KITTI-360 and MultiCamData datasets validate the robustness of our method over arbitrarily placed cameras. Compared with other stereo and multi-camera visual SLAM systems, our method obtains higher pose estimation accuracy with better generalization ability. Our codes and online demos are available at \url{https://github.com/JunhaoWang615/MCVO}</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |
| **[ROVER: A Multi-Season Dataset for Visual SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02506v1)** | 2024-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is a crucial enabler for autonomous navigation in natural, unstructured environments such as parks and gardens. However, these environments present unique challenges for SLAM due to frequent seasonal changes, varying light conditions, and dense vegetation. These factors often degrade the performance of visual SLAM algorithms originally developed for structured urban environments. To address this gap, we present ROVER, a comprehensive benchmark dataset tailored for evaluating visual SLAM algorithms under diverse environmental conditions and spatial configurations. We captured the dataset with a robotic platform equipped with monocular, stereo, and RGB-D cameras, as well as inertial sensors. It covers 39 recordings across five outdoor locations, collected through all seasons and various lighting scenarios, i.e., day, dusk, and night with and without external lighting. With this novel dataset, we evaluate several traditional and deep learning-based SLAM methods and study their performance in diverse challenging conditions. The results demonstrate that while stereo-inertial and RGB-D configurations generally perform better under favorable lighting and moderate vegetation, most SLAM systems perform poorly in low-light and high-vegetation scenarios, particularly during summer and autumn. Our analysis highlights the need for improved adaptability in visual SLAM algorithms for outdoor applications, as current systems struggle with dynamic environmental factors affecting scale, feature extraction, and trajectory consistency. This dataset provides a solid foundation for advancing visual SLAM research in real-world, natural environments, fostering the development of more resilient SLAM systems for long-term outdoor localization and mapping. The dataset and the code of the benchmark are available under https://iis-esslingen.github.io/rover.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 7 figures, 11 tables</p></details> |
| **[Look Ma, No Ground Truth! Ground-Truth-Free Tuning of Structure from Motion and Visual SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01116v1)** | 2024-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluation is critical to both developing and tuning Structure from Motion (SfM) and Visual SLAM (VSLAM) systems, but is universally reliant on high-quality geometric ground truth -- a resource that is not only costly and time-intensive but, in many cases, entirely unobtainable. This dependency on ground truth restricts SfM and SLAM applications across diverse environments and limits scalability to real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose a novel ground-truth-free (GTF) evaluation methodology that eliminates the need for geometric ground truth, instead using sensitivity estimation via sampling from both original and noisy versions of input images. Our approach shows strong correlation with traditional ground-truth-based benchmarks and supports GTF hyperparameter tuning. Removing the need for ground truth opens up new opportunities to leverage a much larger number of dataset sources, and for self-supervised and online tuning, with the potential for a data-driven breakthrough analogous to what has occurred in generative AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uni-SLAM: Uncertainty-Aware Neural Implicit SLAM for Real-Time Dense Indoor Scene Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00242v1)** | 2024-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural implicit fields have recently emerged as a powerful representation method for multi-view surface reconstruction due to their simplicity and state-of-the-art performance. However, reconstructing thin structures of indoor scenes while ensuring real-time performance remains a challenge for dense visual SLAM systems. Previous methods do not consider varying quality of input RGB-D data and employ fixed-frequency mapping process to reconstruct the scene, which could result in the loss of valuable information in some frames. In this paper, we propose Uni-SLAM, a decoupled 3D spatial representation based on hash grids for indoor reconstruction. We introduce a novel defined predictive uncertainty to reweight the loss function, along with strategic local-to-global bundle adjustment. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our system achieves state-of-the-art tracking and mapping accuracy while maintaining real-time performance. It significantly improves over current methods with a 25% reduction in depth L1 error and a 66.86% completion rate within 1 cm on the Replica dataset, reflecting a more accurate reconstruction of thin structures.

| **[SGS-SLAM: Semantic Gaussian Splatting For Neural Dense SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03246v6)** | 2024-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present SGS-SLAM, the first semantic visual SLAM system based on Gaussian Splatting. It incorporates appearance, geometry, and semantic features through multi-channel optimization, addressing the oversmoothing limitations of neural implicit SLAM systems in high-quality rendering, scene understanding, and object-level geometry. We introduce a unique semantic feature loss that effectively compensates for the shortcomings of traditional depth and color losses in object optimization. Through a semantic-guided keyframe selection strategy, we prevent erroneous reconstructions caused by cumulative errors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SGS-SLAM delivers state-of-the-art performance in camera pose estimation, map reconstruction, precise semantic segmentation, and object-level geometric accuracy, while ensuring real-time rendering capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[LiV-GS: LiDAR-Vision Integration for 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM in Outdoor Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12185v1)** | 2024-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present LiV-GS, a LiDAR-visual SLAM system in outdoor environments that leverages 3D Gaussian as a differentiable spatial representation. Notably, LiV-GS is the first method that directly aligns discrete and sparse LiDAR data with continuous differentiable Gaussian maps in large-scale outdoor scenes, overcoming the limitation of fixed resolution in traditional LiDAR mapping. The system aligns point clouds with Gaussian maps using shared covariance attributes for front-end tracking and integrates the normal orientation into the loss function to refines the Gaussian map. To reliably and stably update Gaussians outside the LiDAR field of view, we introduce a novel conditional Gaussian constraint that aligns these Gaussians closely with the nearest reliable ones. The targeted adjustment enables LiV-GS to achieve fast and accurate mapping with novel view synthesis at a rate of 7.98 FPS. Extensive comparative experiments demonstrate LiV-GS's superior performance in SLAM, image rendering and mapping. The successful cross-modal radar-LiDAR localization highlights the potential of LiV-GS for applications in cross-modal semantic positioning and object segmentation with Gaussian maps.</p></details> |  |
| **[GSORB-SLAM: Gaussian Splatting SLAM benefits from ORB features and Transmittance information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11356v2)** | 2024-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently sparked a renewed wave of dense visual SLAM research. However, current methods face challenges such as sensitivity to artifacts and noise, sub-optimal selection of training viewpoints, and a lack of light global optimization. In this paper, we propose a dense SLAM system that tightly couples 3DGS with ORB features. We design a joint optimization approach for robust tracking and effectively reducing the impact of noise and artifacts. This involves combining novel geometric observations, derived from accumulated transmittance, with ORB features extracted from pixel data. Furthermore, to improve mapping quality, we propose an adaptive Gaussian expansion and regularization method that enables Gaussian primitives to represent the scene compactly. This is coupled with a viewpoint selection strategy based on the hybrid graph to mitigate over-fitting effects and enhance convergence quality. Finally, our approach achieves compact and high-quality scene representations and accurate localization. GSORB-SLAM has been evaluated on different datasets, demonstrating outstanding performance. The code will be available.</p></details> |  |
| **[DG-SLAM: Robust Dynamic Gaussian Splatting SLAM with Hybrid Pose Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08373v1)** | 2024-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving robust and precise pose estimation in dynamic scenes is a significant research challenge in Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). Recent advancements integrating Gaussian Splatting into SLAM systems have proven effective in creating high-quality renderings using explicit 3D Gaussian models, significantly improving environmental reconstruction fidelity. However, these approaches depend on a static environment assumption and face challenges in dynamic environments due to inconsistent observations of geometry and photometry. To address this problem, we propose DG-SLAM, the first robust dynamic visual SLAM system grounded in 3D Gaussians, which provides precise camera pose estimation alongside high-fidelity reconstructions. Specifically, we propose effective strategies, including motion mask generation, adaptive Gaussian point management, and a hybrid camera tracking algorithm to improve the accuracy and robustness of pose estimation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DG-SLAM delivers state-of-the-art performance in camera pose estimation, map reconstruction, and novel-view synthesis in dynamic scenes, outperforming existing methods meanwhile preserving real-time rendering ability.</p></details> |  |
| **[MBA-SLAM: Motion Blur Aware Dense Visual SLAM with Radiance Fields Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08279v1)** | 2024-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Emerging 3D scene representations, such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have demonstrated their effectiveness in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) for photo-realistic rendering, particularly when using high-quality video sequences as input. However, existing methods struggle with motion-blurred frames, which are common in real-world scenarios like low-light or long-exposure conditions. This often results in a significant reduction in both camera localization accuracy and map reconstruction quality. To address this challenge, we propose a dense visual SLAM pipeline (i.e. MBA-SLAM) to handle severe motion-blurred inputs. Our approach integrates an efficient motion blur-aware tracker with either neural radiance fields or Gaussian Splatting based mapper. By accurately modeling the physical image formation process of motion-blurred images, our method simultaneously learns 3D scene representation and estimates the cameras' local trajectory during exposure time, enabling proactive compensation for motion blur caused by camera movement. In our experiments, we demonstrate that MBA-SLAM surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods in both camera localization and map reconstruction, showcasing superior performance across a range of datasets, including synthetic and real datasets featuring sharp images as well as those affected by motion blur, highlighting the versatility and robustness of our approach. Code is available at https://github.com/WU-CVGL/MBA-SLAM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lost in Tracking Translation: A Comprehensive Analysis of Visual SLAM in Human-Centered XR and IoT Ecosystems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07146v1)** | 2024-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advancements in tracking algorithms have empowered nascent applications across various domains, from steering autonomous vehicles to guiding robots to enhancing augmented reality experiences for users. However, these algorithms are application-specific and do not work across applications with different types of motion; even a tracking algorithm designed for a given application does not work in scenarios deviating from highly standard conditions. For example, a tracking algorithm designed for robot navigation inside a building will not work for tracking the same robot in an outdoor environment. To demonstrate this problem, we evaluate the performance of the state-of-the-art tracking methods across various applications and scenarios. To inform our analysis, we first categorize algorithmic, environmental, and locomotion-related challenges faced by tracking algorithms. We quantitatively evaluate the performance using multiple tracking algorithms and representative datasets for a wide range of Internet of Things (IoT) and Extended Reality (XR) applications, including autonomous vehicles, drones, and humans. Our analysis shows that no tracking algorithm works across different applications and scenarios within applications. Ultimately, using the insights generated from our analysis, we discuss multiple approaches to improving the tracking performance using input data characterization, leveraging intermediate information, and output evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Map++: Towards User-Participatory Visual SLAM Systems with Efficient Map Expansion and Sharing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02553v1)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constructing precise 3D maps is crucial for the development of future map-based systems such as self-driving and navigation. However, generating these maps in complex environments, such as multi-level parking garages or shopping malls, remains a formidable challenge. In this paper, we introduce a participatory sensing approach that delegates map-building tasks to map users, thereby enabling cost-effective and continuous data collection. The proposed method harnesses the collective efforts of users, facilitating the expansion and ongoing update of the maps as the environment evolves. We realized this approach by developing Map++, an efficient system that functions as a plug-and-play extension, supporting participatory map-building based on existing SLAM algorithms. Map++ addresses a plethora of scalability issues in this participatory map-building system by proposing a set of lightweight, application-layer protocols. We evaluated Map++ in four representative settings: an indoor garage, an outdoor plaza, a public SLAM benchmark, and a simulated environment. The results demonstrate that Map++ can reduce traffic volume by approximately 46% with negligible degradation in mapping accuracy, i.e., less than 0.03m compared to the baseline system. It can support approximately $2 \times$ as many concurrent users as the baseline under the same network bandwidth. Additionally, for users who travel on already-mapped trajectories, they can directly utilize the existing maps for localization and save 47% of the CPU usage.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 15 figures.

| **[BodySLAM: A Generalized Monocular Visual SLAM Framework for Surgical Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03078v2)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Endoscopic surgery relies on two-dimensional views, posing challenges for surgeons in depth perception and instrument manipulation. While Monocular Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (MVSLAM) has emerged as a promising solution, its implementation in endoscopic procedures faces significant challenges due to hardware limitations, such as the use of a monocular camera and the absence of odometry sensors. This study presents BodySLAM, a robust deep learning-based MVSLAM approach that addresses these challenges through three key components: CycleVO, a novel unsupervised monocular pose estimation module; the integration of the state-of-the-art Zoe architecture for monocular depth estimation; and a 3D reconstruction module creating a coherent surgical map. The approach is rigorously evaluated using three publicly available datasets (Hamlyn, EndoSLAM, and SCARED) spanning laparoscopy, gastroscopy, and colonoscopy scenarios, and benchmarked against four state-of-the-art methods. Results demonstrate that CycleVO exhibited competitive performance with the lowest inference time among pose estimation methods, while maintaining robust generalization capabilities, whereas Zoe significantly outperformed existing algorithms for depth estimation in endoscopy. BodySLAM's strong performance across diverse endoscopic scenarios demonstrates its potential as a viable MVSLAM solution for endoscopic applications.</p></details> | 16 pages, 7 figures |
| **[LGU-SLAM: Learnable Gaussian Uncertainty Matching with Deformable Correlation Sampling for Deep Visual SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23231v1)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) techniques, e.g., DROID, have made significant advancements by leveraging deep visual odometry on dense flow fields. In general, they heavily rely on global visual similarity matching. However, the ambiguous similarity interference in uncertain regions could often lead to excessive noise in correspondences, ultimately misleading SLAM in geometric modeling. To address this issue, we propose a Learnable Gaussian Uncertainty (LGU) matching. It mainly focuses on precise correspondence construction. In our scheme, a learnable 2D Gaussian uncertainty model is designed to associate matching-frame pairs. It could generate input-dependent Gaussian distributions for each correspondence map. Additionally, a multi-scale deformable correlation sampling strategy is devised to adaptively fine-tune the sampling of each direction by a priori look-up ranges, enabling reliable correlation construction. Furthermore, a KAN-bias GRU component is adopted to improve a temporal iterative enhancement for accomplishing sophisticated spatio-temporal modeling with limited parameters. The extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets are conducted to validate the effectiveness and superiority of our method.</p></details> |  |

While VSLAM research has achieved significant advancements, its robustness under challenging situations, such as poor lighting, dynamic environments, motion blur, and sensor failures, remains a challenging issue. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel RGB-D dataset designed for evaluating the robustness of VSLAM systems. The dataset comprises real-world indoor scenes with dynamic objects, motion blur, and varying illumination, as well as emulated camera failures, including lens dirt, condensation, underexposure, and overexposure. Additionally, we offer open-source scripts for injecting camera failures into any images, enabling further customization by the research community. Our experiments demonstrate that ORB-SLAM2, a traditional VSLAM algorithm, and TartanVO, a Deep Learning-based VO algorithm, can experience performance degradation under these challenging conditions. Therefore, this dataset and the camera failure open-source tools provide a valuable resource for developing more robust VSLAM systems capable of handling real-world challenges.</p></details> | 6 pages |

Of the various thermal comfort indicators, the mean radiant temperature (MRT) is very challenging to measure. Most common measurement methodologies are time-consuming and not user-friendly. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel MRT measurement framework that uses visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and semantic segmentation techniques. The proposed approach follows the rule of thumb of the traditional MRT calculation method using surface temperature and view factors. However, it employs visual SLAM and creates a 3D thermal point cloud with enriched surface temperature information. The framework then implements Grounded SAM, a new object detection and segmentation tool to extract features with distinct temperature profiles on building surfaces. The detailed segmentation of thermal features not only reduces potential errors in the calculation of the MRT but also provides an efficient reconstruction of the spatial MRT distribution in the indoor environment. We also validate the calculation results with the reference measurement methodology. This data-driven framework offers faster and more efficient MRT measurements and spatial mapping than conventional methods. It can enable the direct engagement of researchers and practitioners in MRT measurements and contribute to research on thermal comfort and radiant cooling and heating systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2024 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Monocular Visual Place Recognition in LiDAR Maps via Cross-Modal State Space Model and Multi-View Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06285v1)** | 2024-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving monocular camera localization within pre-built LiDAR maps can bypass the simultaneous mapping process of visual SLAM systems, potentially reducing the computational overhead of autonomous localization. To this end, one of the key challenges is cross-modal place recognition, which involves retrieving 3D scenes (point clouds) from a LiDAR map according to online RGB images. In this paper, we introduce an efficient framework to learn descriptors for both RGB images and point clouds. It takes visual state space model (VMamba) as the backbone and employs a pixel-view-scene joint training strategy for cross-modal contrastive learning. To address the field-of-view differences, independent descriptors are generated from multiple evenly distributed viewpoints for point clouds. A visible 3D points overlap strategy is then designed to quantify the similarity between point cloud views and RGB images for multi-view supervision. Additionally, when generating descriptors from pixel-level features using NetVLAD, we compensate for the loss of geometric information, and introduce an efficient scheme for multi-view generation. Experimental results on the KITTI and KITTI-360 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our method. The code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

Our contributions are threefold: (i) a Bounded Rectification technique to prevent tagging many non-corner points as a corner in FAST detection, improving SLAM accuracy. (ii) A novel Pyramidal Culling and Aggregation (PyCA) technique that yields robust features while suppressing redundant ones at high speeds by harnessing a GPU device. PyCA uses our new Multi-Location Per Thread culling strategy (MLPT) and Thread-Efficient Warp-Allocation (TEWA) scheme for GPU to enable Jetson-SLAM achieving high accuracy and speed on embedded devices. (iii) Jetson-SLAM library achieves resource efficiency by having a data-sharing mechanism. Our experiments on three challenging datasets: KITTI, EuRoC, and KAIST-VIO, and two highly accurate SLAM backends: Full-BA and ICE-BA show that Jetson-SLAM is the fastest available accurate and GPU-accelerated SLAM system (Fig. 1).</p></details> |  |
| **[Compact 3D Gaussian Splatting For Dense Visual SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11247v2)** | 2024-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work has shown that 3D Gaussian-based SLAM enables high-quality reconstruction, accurate pose estimation, and real-time rendering of scenes. However, these approaches are built on a tremendous number of redundant 3D Gaussian ellipsoids, leading to high memory and storage costs, and slow training speed. To address the limitation, we propose a compact 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM system that reduces the number and the parameter size of Gaussian ellipsoids. A sliding window-based masking strategy is first proposed to reduce the redundant ellipsoids. Then we observe that the covariance matrix (geometry) of most 3D Gaussian ellipsoids are extremely similar, which motivates a novel geometry codebook to compress 3D Gaussian geometric attributes, i.e., the parameters. Robust and accurate pose estimation is achieved by a global bundle adjustment method with reprojection loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves faster training and rendering speed while maintaining the state-of-the-art (SOTA) quality of the scene representation.</p></details> |  |

Photometric calibration helps normalize pixel intensity values under different lighting conditions, and thereby improves the direct component of our H-SLAM. A tangential benefit also results to the indirect component of H-SLAM given that the detected features are more stable across variable lighting conditions. Our proposed photometrically calibrated H-SLAM is tested on several datasets, including the TUM monoVO as well as on a dataset we created. Calibrated H-SLAM outperforms other state of the art direct, indirect, and hybrid Visual SLAM systems in all the experiments. Furthermore, in online SLAM tested at our site, it also significantly outperformed the other SLAM Systems.</p></details> |  |

Our FLAF-based visual navigation is built upon a feature-based visual teach and repeat (VT\&R) framework, which supports many robotic applications by teaching a robot to navigate on various paths that cover a significant portion of daily autonomous navigation requirements. However, tracking failure in feature-based visual simultaneous localization and mapping (VSLAM) caused by textureless regions in human-made environments is still limiting VT\&R to be adopted in the real world. To address this problem, the proposed view planner is integrated into a feature-based visual SLAM system to build up an active VT\&R system that avoids tracking failure. In our system, a pan-tilt unit (PTU)-based active camera is mounted on the mobile robot. Using FLAF, the active camera-based VSLAM operates during the teaching phase to construct a complete path map and in the repeat phase to maintain stable localization. FLAF orients the robot toward more map points to avoid mapping failures during path learning and toward more feature-identifiable map points beneficial for localization while following the learned trajectory. Experiments in real scenarios demonstrate that FLAF outperforms the methods that do not consider feature-identifiability, and our active VT\&R system performs well in complex environments by effectively dealing with low-texture regions.</p></details> |  |

While learning-based methods have surpassed traditional handcrafted techniques, their training often relies on simplistic homography-based simulations of multi-view perspectives, limiting model generalisability. This paper presents a novel approach leveraging Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) to generate a diverse and realistic dataset consisting of indoor and outdoor scenes. Our proposed methodology adapts state-of-the-art feature detectors and descriptors for training on multi-view NeRF-synthesised data, with supervision achieved through perspective projective geometry. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed methodology achieves competitive or superior performance on standard benchmarks for relative pose estimation, point cloud registration, and homography estimation while requiring significantly less training data and time compared to existing approaches.</p></details> |  |

Given the inherent ambiguity of this setup, we introduce a novel system, HMD$^2$, designed to balance between motion reconstruction and generation. From a reconstruction standpoint, our system aims to maximally utilize the camera streams to produce both analytical and learned features, including head motion, SLAM point cloud, and image embeddings. On the generative front, HMD$^2$ employs a multi-modal conditional motion Diffusion model, incorporating a time-series backbone to maintain temporal coherence in generated motions, and utilizes autoregressive in-painting to facilitate online motion inference with minimal latency (0.17 seconds). Collectively, we demonstrate that our system offers a highly effective and robust solution capable of scaling to an extensive dataset of over 200 hours collected in a wide range of complex indoor and outdoor environments using publicly available smart glasses.</p></details> |  |

Our system adopts a hybrid approach that combines deep learning techniques for feature detection and matching with traditional backend optimization methods. Specifically, we propose a unified convolutional neural network (CNN) that simultaneously extracts keypoints and structural lines. These features are then associated, matched, triangulated, and optimized in a coupled manner. Additionally, we introduce a lightweight relocalization pipeline that reuses the built map, where keypoints, lines, and a structure graph are used to match the query frame with the map. To enhance the applicability of the proposed system to real-world robots, we deploy and accelerate the feature detection and matching networks using C++ and NVIDIA TensorRT. Extensive experiments conducted on various datasets demonstrate that our system outperforms other state-of-the-art visual SLAM systems in illumination-challenging environments. Efficiency evaluations show that our system can run at a rate of 73Hz on a PC and 40Hz on an embedded platform.</p></details> | 19 pages, 14 figures |

We propose an efficient frontiers filtering method that takes into account the common IoU map frontiers and reduces the frontiers for each robot. Additionally, we also present an approach to guide robots to previously visited goal positions to promote loop closure to reduce SLAM uncertainty.

| **[Addressing the challenges of loop detection in agricultural environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15761v2)** | 2024-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While visual SLAM systems are well studied and achieve impressive results in indoor and urban settings, natural, outdoor and open-field environments are much less explored and still present relevant research challenges. Visual navigation and local mapping have shown a relatively good performance in open-field environments. However, globally consistent mapping and long-term localization still depend on the robustness of loop detection and closure, for which the literature is scarce. In this work we propose a novel method to pave the way towards robust loop detection in open fields, particularly in agricultural settings, based on local feature search and stereo geometric refinement, with a final stage of relative pose estimation. Our method consistently achieves good loop detections, with a median error of 15cm. We aim to characterize open fields as a novel environment for loop detection, understanding the limitations and problems that arise when dealing with them.</p></details> |  |

The method consists of two steps: visual perception and path planning. The visual perception part uses ORBSLAM3 enhanced with optical flow to estimate the car's poses and extract rich texture information from the scene. In the path planning phase, we employ a method combining a control Lyapunov function and control barrier function in the form of quadratic program (CLF-CBF-QP) together with an obstacle shape reconstruction process (SRP) to plan safe and stable trajectories. To validate the performance and robustness of the proposed method, simulation experiments were conducted with a car in various complex indoor environments using the Gazebo simulation environment. Our method can effectively avoid obstacles in the scenes. The proposed algorithm outperforms benchmark algorithms in achieving more stable and shorter trajectories across multiple simulated scenes.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages; Submitted to a journal</p></details> |
| **[Visual SLAM with 3D Gaussian Primitives and Depth Priors Enabling Novel View Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05635v2)** | 2024-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional geometry-based SLAM systems lack dense 3D reconstruction capabilities since their data association usually relies on feature correspondences. Additionally, learning-based SLAM systems often fall short in terms of real-time performance and accuracy. Balancing real-time performance with dense 3D reconstruction capabilities is a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a real-time RGB-D SLAM system that incorporates a novel view synthesis technique, 3D Gaussian Splatting, for 3D scene representation and pose estimation. This technique leverages the real-time rendering performance of 3D Gaussian Splatting with rasterization and allows for differentiable optimization in real time through CUDA implementation. We also enable mesh reconstruction from 3D Gaussians for explicit dense 3D reconstruction. To estimate accurate camera poses, we utilize a rotation-translation decoupled strategy with inverse optimization. This involves iteratively updating both in several iterations through gradient-based optimization. This process includes differentiably rendering RGB, depth, and silhouette maps and updating the camera parameters to minimize a combined loss of photometric loss, depth geometry loss, and visibility loss, given the existing 3D Gaussian map. However, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) struggles to accurately represent surfaces due to the multi-view inconsistency of 3D Gaussians, which can lead to reduced accuracy in both camera pose estimation and scene reconstruction. To address this, we utilize depth priors as additional regularization to enforce geometric constraints, thereby improving the accuracy of both pose estimation and 3D reconstruction. We also provide extensive experimental results on public benchmark datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods in terms of pose accuracy, geometric accuracy, and rendering performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[DynaPix SLAM: A Pixel-Based Dynamic Visual SLAM Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09879v2)** | 2024-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (V-SLAM) methods achieve remarkable performance in static environments, but face challenges in dynamic scenes where moving objects severely affect their core modules. To avoid this, dynamic V-SLAM approaches often leverage semantic information, geometric constraints, or optical flow. However, these methods are limited by imprecise estimations and their reliance on the accuracy of deep-learning models. Moreover, predefined thresholds for static/dynamic classification, the a-priori selection of dynamic object classes, and the inability to recognize unknown or unexpected moving objects, often degrade their performance. To address these limitations, we introduce DynaPix, a novel semantic-free V-SLAM system based on per-pixel motion probability estimation and an improved pose optimization process. The per-pixel motion probability is estimated using a static background differencing method on image data and optical flows computed on splatted frames. With DynaPix, we fully integrate these probabilities into map point selection and apply them through weighted bundle adjustment within the tracking and optimization modules of ORB-SLAM2. We thoroughly evaluate our method using the GRADE and TUM RGB-D datasets, showing significantly lower trajectory errors and longer tracking times in both static and dynamic sequences.

| **[Advancements in Translation Accuracy for Stereo Visual-Inertial Initialization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15082v4)** | 2024-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the current initialization method in the state-of-the-art Stereo Visual-Inertial SLAM framework, ORB-SLAM3 has limitations. Its success depends on the performance of the pure stereo SLAM system and is based on the underlying assumption that pure visual SLAM can accurately estimate the camera trajectory, which is essential for inertial parameter estimation. Meanwhile, the further improved initialization method for ORB-SLAM3, known as Stereo-NEC, is time-consuming due to applying keypoint tracking to estimate gyroscope bias with normal epipolar constraints. To address the limitations of previous methods, this paper proposes a method aimed at enhancing translation accuracy during the initialization stage. The fundamental concept of our method is to improve the translation estimate with a 3 Degree-of-Freedom (DoF) Bundle Adjustment (BA), independently, while the rotation estimate is fixed, instead of using ORB-SLAM3's 6-DoF BA. Additionally, the rotation estimate will be updated by considering IMU measurements and gyroscope bias, unlike ORB-SLAM3's rotation, which is directly obtained from stereo visual odometry and may yield inferior results when operating in challenging scenarios. We also conduct extensive evaluations on the public benchmark, the EuRoC dataset, demonstrating that our method excels in accuracy.</p></details> |  |

It determines the pose of a camera sensor by robustly associating the object detections in the current frame with 3D objects in a lightweight object-level map. Object graphs, considering semantic uncertainties, are constructed for both the incoming camera frame and the pre-built map. Objects are represented as graph nodes, and each node employs unique semantic descriptors based on our devised graph kernels. We extract a subgraph from the target map graph by identifying potential object associations for each object detection, then refine these associations and pose estimations using a RANSAC-inspired strategy. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate that our method achieves more accurate data association and significantly increases relocalization success rates compared to baseline methods. The implementation of our method is released at \url{https://github.com/yutongwangBIT/GOReloc}.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, accepted by IEEE RAL</p></details> |

Despite excellent accuracy, however, such approaches are often expensive to run or do not generalize well zero-shot. Their runtime can also fluctuate wildly while their frontend and backend fight for access to GPU resources. To address these problems, we introduce Deep Patch Visual (DPV) SLAM, a method for monocular visual SLAM on a single GPU. DPV-SLAM maintains a high minimum framerate and small memory overhead (5-7G) compared to existing deep SLAM systems. On real-world datasets, DPV-SLAM runs at 1x-4x real-time framerates. We achieve comparable accuracy to DROID-SLAM on EuRoC and TartanAir while running 2.5x faster using a fraction of the memory. DPV-SLAM is an extension to the DPVO visual odometry system; its code can be found in the same repository: https://github.com/princeton-vl/DPVO</p></details> |  |

This capability is crucial for mobile robots to have reliable navigation, build accurate maps, and have precise behaviors around human collaborators. This paper focuses on the development of robust short-term relocalization capabilities for mobile robots using a monocular camera system. A novel multimodal keyframe descriptor is introduced, that contains semantic information of objects detected in the environment and the spatial information of the camera. Using this descriptor, a new Keyframe-based Place Recognition (KPR) method is proposed that is formulated as a multi-stage keyframe filtering algorithm, leading to a new relocalization pipeline for MKVSLAM systems. The proposed approach is evaluated over several indoor GPS denied datasets and demonstrates accurate pose recovery, in comparison to a bag-of-words approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, Keywords: VSLAM, Localization, Semantics.

However, the presence of inaccuracies in these depth images can greatly hinder the effectiveness of these applications, resulting in sub-optimal results. Depth images produced by commercially available cameras frequently exhibit noise, which manifests as flickering pixels and erroneous patches. ML-based methods to rectify these images are unsuitable for edge devices that have very limited computational resources. Non-ML methods are much faster but have limited accuracy, especially for correcting errors that are a result of occlusion and camera movement. We propose a scheme called VoxDepth that is fast, accurate, and runs very well on edge devices. It relies on a host of novel techniques: 3D point cloud construction and fusion, and using it to create a template that can fix erroneous depth images. VoxDepth shows superior results on both synthetic and real-world datasets. We demonstrate a 31% improvement in quality as compared to state-of-the-art methods on real-world depth datasets, while maintaining a competitive framerate of 27 FPS (frames per second).</p></details> |  |

Casual video captures often suffer from motion blur and varying appearances, which degrade the final quality of coherent 3D visual representation. We propose integrating the physical imaging into the SLAM system, which employs linear HDR radiance maps to collect measurements. Specifically, individual frames aggregate images of multiple poses along the camera trajectory to explain prevalent motion blur in hand-held videos. Additionally, we accommodate per-frame appearance variation by dedicating explicit variables for image formation steps, namely white balance, exposure time, and camera response function. Through joint optimization of additional variables, the SLAM pipeline produces high-quality images with more accurate trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach can be incorporated into recent visual SLAM pipelines using various scene representations, such as neural radiance fields or Gaussian splatting.</p></details> | ECCV 2024 |

To this end, we propose a complementarity-aware deep learning approach for RGB-D-based material classification built on top of an object-oriented pipeline. The approach further integrates the ORB-SLAM2 method for 3D scene mapping with multiscale clustering of the detected material semantics in the point cloud map generated by the visual SLAM algorithm.

Addressing these challenges, our research introduces AVM-SLAM, a cutting-edge semantic visual SLAM architecture with multi-sensor fusion in a bird's eye view (BEV). This novel framework synergizes the capabilities of four fisheye cameras, wheel encoders, and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) to construct a robust SLAM system.

In our work, we employ dictionary factors for scene representation, encoding the geometry and appearance information of the scene as a combination of basis and coefficient factors. Compared to neural implicit dense visual SLAM methods that directly encode scene information as features, our method exhibits superior scene detail reconstruction capabilities and more efficient memory usage, while our model size is insensitive to the size of the scene map, making our method more suitable for large-scale scenes. Additionally, we employ feature integration rendering to accelerate color rendering speed while ensuring color rendering quality, further enhancing the real-time performance of our neural SLAM method. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method is competitive with existing state-of-the-art neural implicit SLAM methods in terms of real-time performance, localization accuracy, and scene reconstruction quality.

Although deep learning-based local features excel at capturing high-level information and perform well on matching benchmarks, they struggle with generalization in continuous motion scenes, adversely affecting loop detection accuracy. Our system employs a Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) strategy to optimize the training of keypoint extraction networks, enhancing their adaptability to diverse environments. Additionally, we introduce a coarse-to-fine feature tracking mechanism for learned keypoints. It begins with a direct method to approximate the relative pose between consecutive frames, followed by a feature matching method for refined pose estimation. To mitigate cumulative positioning errors, DK-SLAM incorporates a novel online learning module that utilizes binary features for loop closure detection. This module dynamically identifies loop nodes within a sequence, ensuring accurate and efficient localization. Experimental evaluations on publicly available datasets demonstrate that DK-SLAM outperforms leading traditional and learning based SLAM systems, such as ORB-SLAM3 and LIFT-SLAM. These results underscore the efficacy and robustness of our DK-SLAM in varied and challenging real-world environments.</p></details> | In submission |

A probabilistic interpretation of the SLAM task allows for incorporating prior knowledge and for operation under uncertainty. Contrary to the common practice of computing point estimates of the system states, we capture the full posterior density through approximate Bayesian inference. This dynamic learning task falls under state estimation, where the state-of-the-art is in sequential Monte Carlo methods that tackle the forward filtering problem. In this paper, we introduce a framework for probabilistic SLAM using particle smoothing that does not only incorporate observed data in current state estimates, but it also back-tracks the updated knowledge to correct for past drift and ambiguities in both the map and in the states. Our solution can efficiently handle both dense and sparse map representations by Rao-Blackwellization of conditionally linear and conditionally linearized models. We show through simulations and real-world experiments how the principles apply to radio (BLE/Wi-Fi), magnetic field, and visual SLAM. The proposed solution is general, efficient, and works well under confounding noise.</p></details> | 23 pages, 7 figures |

However, human colonoscopies pose formidable challenges like occlusions, blur, light changes, lack of texture, deformation, water jets or tool interaction, which result in very frequent tracking losses. ORB-SLAM3, the top performing multiple-map V-SLAM, is unable to recover from them by merging sub-maps or relocalizing the camera, due to the poor performance of its place recognition algorithm based on ORB features and DBoW2 bag-of-words. We present CudaSIFT-SLAM, the first V-SLAM system able to process complete human colonoscopies in real-time. To overcome the limitations of ORB-SLAM3, we use SIFT instead of ORB features and replace the DBoW2 direct index with the more computationally demanding brute-force matching, being able to successfully match images separated in time for relocation and map merging. Real-time performance is achieved thanks to CudaSIFT, a GPU implementation for SIFT extraction and brute-force matching. We benchmark our system in the C3VD phantom colon dataset, and in a full real colonoscopy from the Endomapper dataset, demonstrating the capabilities to merge sub-maps and relocate in them, obtaining significantly longer sub-maps. Our system successfully maps in real-time 88 % of the frames in the C3VD dataset. In a real screening colonoscopy, despite the much higher prevalence of occluded and blurred frames, the mapping coverage is 53 % in carefully explored areas and 38 % in the full sequence, a 70 % improvement over ORB-SLAM3.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 10 figures, 6 tables, under revision</p></details> |

This paper proposes a novel deep SLAM network with dual visual factors. The basic idea is to integrate both photometric factor and re-projection factor into the end-to-end differentiable structure through multi-factor data association module. We show that the proposed network dynamically learns and adjusts the confidence maps of both visual factors and it can be further extended to include the IMU factors as well. Extensive experiments validate that our proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on several public datasets, including TartanAir, EuRoC and ETH3D-SLAM. Specifically, when dynamically fusing the three factors together, the absolute trajectory error for both monocular and stereo configurations on EuRoC dataset has reduced by 45.3% and 36.2% respectively.</p></details> | Accepted to ICRA2024 |
| **[Synergistic Global-space Camera and Human Reconstruction from Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14855v1)** | 2024-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remarkable strides have been made in reconstructing static scenes or human bodies from monocular videos. Yet, the two problems have largely been approached independently, without much synergy. Most visual SLAM methods can only reconstruct camera trajectories and scene structures up to scale, while most HMR methods reconstruct human meshes in metric scale but fall short in reasoning with cameras and scenes. This work introduces Synergistic Camera and Human Reconstruction (SynCHMR) to marry the best of both worlds. Specifically, we design Human-aware Metric SLAM to reconstruct metric-scale camera poses and scene point clouds using camera-frame HMR as a strong prior, addressing depth, scale, and dynamic ambiguities. Conditioning on the dense scene recovered, we further learn a Scene-aware SMPL Denoiser to enhance world-frame HMR by incorporating spatio-temporal coherency and dynamic scene constraints. Together, they lead to consistent reconstructions of camera trajectories, human meshes, and dense scene point clouds in a common world frame.

We propose a new approach to enhance inaccurate regions in semantic masks, particularly in marginal areas. Utilizing the geometric information present in depth images, this method enables accurate removal of dynamic objects, thereby reducing the probability of camera drift. Additionally, we introduce a keyframe selection strategy for dynamic scenes, which enhances camera tracking robustness against large-scale objects and improves the efficiency of mapping.

However, traditional manual feature-based methods in challenging lighting environments make it difficult to ensure robustness and accuracy. Some deep learning-based methods show potential but still have significant drawbacks. To address this problem, we propose a novel hybrid system for visual SLAM based on the LightGlue deep learning network. It uses deep local feature descriptors to replace traditional hand-crafted features and a more efficient and accurate deep network to achieve fast and precise feature matching. Thus, we use the robustness of deep learning to improve the whole system. We have combined traditional geometry-based approaches to introduce a complete visual SLAM system for monocular, binocular, and RGB-D sensors. We thoroughly tested the proposed system on four public datasets: KITTI, EuRoC, TUM, and 4Season, as well as on actual campus scenes. The experimental results show that the proposed method exhibits better accuracy and robustness in adapting to low-light and strongly light-varying environments than traditional manual features and deep learning-based methods. It can also run on GPU in real time.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a generic sparse visual SLAM framework capable of running on any number of cameras and in any arrangement. Our SLAM system uses the generalized camera model, which allows us to represent an arbitrary multi-camera system as a single imaging device. Additionally, it takes advantage of the overlapping fields of view (FoV) by extracting cross-matched features across cameras in the rig. This limits the linear rise in the number of features with the number of cameras and keeps the computational load in check while enabling an accurate representation of the scene. We evaluate our method in terms of accuracy, robustness, and run time on indoor and outdoor datasets that include challenging real-world scenarios such as narrow corridors, featureless spaces, and dynamic objects. We show that our system can adapt to different camera configurations and allows real-time execution for typical robotic applications. Finally, we benchmark the impact of the critical design parameters - the number of cameras and the overlap between their FoV that define the camera configuration for SLAM. All our software and datasets are freely available for further research.</p></details> |  |

To address these shortcomings, we propose a neural mapping framework which anchors lightweight neural fields to the pose graph of a sparse visual SLAM system. Our approach shows the ability to integrate large-scale loop closures, while limiting necessary reintegration. Furthermore, we verify the scalability of our approach by demonstrating successful building-scale mapping taking multiple loop closures into account during the optimization, and show that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches on large scenes in terms of quality and runtime.

The ones that deal with dynamic objects in the scenes usually rely on deep-learning-based methods to detect and filter these objects. However, these methods cannot deal with unknown moving objects. This work presents Panoptic-SLAM, an open-source visual SLAM system robust to dynamic environments, even in the presence of unknown objects. It uses panoptic segmentation to filter dynamic objects from the scene during the state estimation process. Panoptic-SLAM is based on ORB-SLAM3, a state-of-the-art SLAM system for static environments. The implementation was tested using real-world datasets and compared with several state-of-the-art systems from the literature, including DynaSLAM, DS-SLAM, SaD-SLAM, PVO and FusingPanoptic. For example, Panoptic-SLAM is on average four times more accurate than PVO, the most recent panoptic-based approach for visual SLAM. Also, experiments were performed using a quadruped robot with an RGB-D camera to test the applicability of our method in real-world scenarios. The tests were validated by a ground-truth created with a motion capture system.</p></details> |  |

Meanwhile, large scale applications aiming at the data collection in complex environments like factory halls or construction sites are becoming feasible. However, in contrast to small scale scenarios with building interiors separated to single rooms, shop floors or construction areas require measures at larger distances in potentially texture less areas under difficult illumination. Pose estimation is further aggravated since no GNSS measures are available as it is usual for such indoor applications. In our work, we realize data collection in a large factory hall by a robot system equipped with four stereo cameras as well as a 3D laser scanner. We apply our state-of-the-art LiDAR and visual SLAM approaches and discuss the respective pros and cons of the different sensor types for trajectory estimation and dense map generation in such an environment. Additionally, dense and accurate depth maps are generated by 3D Gaussian splatting, which we plan to use in the context of our project aiming on the automatic construction and site monitoring.</p></details> |  |

Our method, which runs live at 3fps, utilises Gaussians as the only 3D representation, unifying the required representation for accurate, efficient tracking, mapping, and high-quality rendering. Designed for challenging monocular settings, our approach is seamlessly extendable to RGB-D SLAM when an external depth sensor is available. Several innovations are required to continuously reconstruct 3D scenes with high fidelity from a live camera. First, to move beyond the original 3DGS algorithm, which requires accurate poses from an offline Structure from Motion (SfM) system, we formulate camera tracking for 3DGS using direct optimisation against the 3D Gaussians, and show that this enables fast and robust tracking with a wide basin of convergence. Second, by utilising the explicit nature of the Gaussians, we introduce geometric verification and regularisation to handle the ambiguities occurring in incremental 3D dense reconstruction. Finally, we introduce a full SLAM system which not only achieves state-of-the-art results in novel view synthesis and trajectory estimation but also reconstruction of tiny and even transparent objects.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR2...</summary><p>CVPR2024 Highlight.

When a pre-built 3D map is not available, the techniques of visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) are typically adopted. Due to error accumulation, visual SLAM (vSLAM) usually suffers from long-term drift. This paper proposes a framework to increase the localization accuracy by fusing the vSLAM with a deep-learning-based ground-to-satellite (G2S) image registration method. In this framework, a coarse (spatial correlation bound check) to fine (visual odometry consistency check) method is designed to select the valid G2S prediction. The selected prediction is then fused with the SLAM measurement by solving a scaled pose graph problem. To further increase the localization accuracy, we provide an iterative trajectory fusion pipeline. The proposed framework is evaluated on two well-known autonomous driving datasets, and the results demonstrate the accuracy and robustness in terms of vehicle localization.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 6 figures, to be published in 2024 International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)</p></details> |

It facilitates a better balance between efficiency and accuracy. Compared to recent SLAM methods employing neural implicit representations, our method utilizes a real-time differentiable splatting rendering pipeline that offers significant speedup to map optimization and RGB-D rendering. Specifically, we propose an adaptive expansion strategy that adds new or deletes noisy 3D Gaussians in order to efficiently reconstruct new observed scene geometry and improve the mapping of previously observed areas. This strategy is essential to extend 3D Gaussian representation to reconstruct the whole scene rather than synthesize a static object in existing methods. Moreover, in the pose tracking process, an effective coarse-to-fine technique is designed to select reliable 3D Gaussian representations to optimize camera pose, resulting in runtime reduction and robust estimation.

In this research, we present a significant extension and refinement of the state-of-the-art stereo SLAM system, known as ORB-SLAM2, with the objective of attaining even higher precision. To accomplish this objective, we commence by mapping measurements from all cameras onto a virtual camera termed BundledFrame. This virtual camera is meticulously engineered to seamlessly adapt to multi-camera configurations, facilitating the effective fusion of data captured from multiple cameras. Additionally, we harness extrinsic parameters in the bundle adjustment (BA) process to achieve precise trajectory estimation.Furthermore, we conduct an extensive analysis of the role of bundle adjustment (BA) in the context of multi-camera scenarios, delving into its impact on tracking, local mapping, and global optimization. Our experimental evaluation entails comprehensive comparisons between ground truth data and the state-of-the-art SLAM system. To rigorously assess the system's performance, we utilize the EuRoC datasets. The consistent results of our evaluations demonstrate the superior accuracy of our system in comparison to existing approaches.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods produce low-quality scene reconstruction and low-accuracy localization performance when scaling up to large indoor scenes and long sequences. These limitations are mainly due to their single, global radiance field with finite capacity, which does not adapt to large scenarios. Their end-to-end pose networks are also not robust enough with the growth of cumulative errors in large scenes. To this end, we introduce PLGSLAM, a neural visual SLAM system capable of high-fidelity surface reconstruction and robust camera tracking in real-time. To handle large-scale indoor scenes, PLGSLAM proposes a progressive scene representation method which dynamically allocates new local scene representation trained with frames within a local sliding window. This allows us to scale up to larger indoor scenes and improves robustness (even under pose drifts). In local scene representation, PLGSLAM utilizes tri-planes for local high-frequency features with multi-layer perceptron (MLP) networks for the low-frequency feature, achieving smoothness and scene completion in unobserved areas. Moreover, we propose local-to-global bundle adjustment method with a global keyframe database to address the increased pose drifts on long sequences. Experimental results demonstrate that PLGSLAM achieves state-of-the-art scene reconstruction results and tracking performance across various datasets and scenarios (both in small and large-scale indoor environments).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2024</p></details> |

In addition to challenging front-end data association, thermal imagery presents an additional difficulty for long term relocalization and map reuse. The relative temperatures of objects in thermal imagery change dramatically from day to night. Feature descriptors typically used for relocalization in SLAM are unable to maintain consistency over these diurnal changes. We show that learned feature descriptors can be used within existing Bag of Word based localization schemes to dramatically improve place recognition across large temporal gaps in thermal imagery. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of our trained vocabulary, we have developed a baseline SLAM system, integrating learned features and matching into a classical SLAM algorithm.

Ensuring that sensors are mounted in a manner that enables accurate detection, localization, and mapping is essential for the success of downstream control tasks. However, when designing a new robotic platform, researchers and practitioners alike usually mimic standard configurations or maximize simple heuristics like field-of-view (FOV) coverage to decide where to place exteroceptive sensors. In this work, we conduct an information-theoretic investigation of this overlooked element of robotic perception in the context of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). We show how to formalize the sensor arrangement problem as a form of subset selection under the E-optimality performance criterion. While this formulation is NP-hard in general, we show that a combination of greedy sensor selection and fast convex relaxation-based post-hoc verification enables the efficient recovery of certifiably optimal sensor designs in practice. Results from synthetic experiments reveal that sensors placed with OASIS outperform benchmarks in terms of mean squared error of visual SLAM estimates.</p></details> |  |

However, there are still some challenges: the limited scene representation capability of implicit encodings, the uncertainty in the rendering process from implicit representations, and the disruption of consistency by dynamic objects. To address these challenges, we propose a real-time dynamic visual SLAM system based on local-global fusion neural implicit representation, named DVN-SLAM. To improve the scene representation capability, we introduce a local-global fusion neural implicit representation that enables the construction of an implicit map while considering both global structure and local details. To tackle uncertainties arising from the rendering process, we design an information concentration loss for optimization, aiming to concentrate scene information on object surfaces. The proposed DVN-SLAM achieves competitive performance in localization and mapping across multiple datasets. More importantly, DVN-SLAM demonstrates robustness in dynamic scenes, a trait that sets it apart from other NeRF-based methods.</p></details> |  |

Unlike the current state-of-the-art method, which heavily relies on the accuracy of a pure visual SLAM system to estimate inertial variables without updating camera poses, potentially compromising accuracy and robustness, our approach offers a different solution. We realize the crucial impact of precise gyroscope bias estimation on rotation accuracy. This, in turn, affects trajectory accuracy due to the accumulation of translation errors. To address this, we first independently estimate the gyroscope bias and use it to formulate a maximum a posteriori problem for further refinement. After this refinement, we proceed to update the rotation estimation by performing IMU integration with gyroscope bias removed from gyroscope measurements. We then leverage robust and accurate rotation estimates to enhance translation estimation via 3-DoF bundle adjustment. Moreover, we introduce a novel approach for determining the success of the initialization by evaluating the residual of the normal epipolar constraint. Extensive evaluations on the EuRoC dataset illustrate that our method excels in accuracy and robustness. It outperforms ORB-SLAM3, the current leading stereo visual-inertial initialization method, in terms of absolute trajectory error and relative rotation error, while maintaining competitive computational speed. Notably, even with 5 keyframes for initialization, our method consistently surpasses the state-of-the-art approach using 10 keyframes in rotation accuracy.</p></details> |  |

It then grew to implement Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) on various robots and mobile platforms. As each application brings its own set of contraints on sensors, processing capabilities and locomotion, it raises the question of which SLAM approach is the most appropriate to use in terms of cost, accuracy, computation power and ease of integration. Since most of SLAM approaches are either visual or lidar-based, comparison is difficult. Therefore, we decided to extend RTAB-Map to support both visual and lidar SLAM, providing in one package a tool allowing users to implement and compare a variety of 3D and 2D solutions for a wide range of applications with different robots and sensors. This paper presents this extended version of RTAB-Map and its use in comparing, both quantitatively and qualitatively, a large selection of popular real-world datasets (e.g., KITTI, EuRoC, TUM RGB-D, MIT Stata Center on PR2 robot), outlining strengths and limitations of visual and lidar SLAM configurations from a practical perspective for autonomous navigation applications.</p></details> | 40 pages, 19 figures |

In this paper, we propose a joint multi-task network design for learning several tasks simultaneously. Our main motivation is the computational efficiency achieved by sharing the expensive initial convolutional layers between all tasks.

Some researchers have attempted to enhance localization accuracy by integrating the modeled object residuals into bundle adjustment. However, few have demonstrated better results than feature-based visual SLAM systems, as the generic coarse object models, such as cuboids or ellipsoids, are less accurate than feature points. In this paper, we propose a Visual Object Odometry and Mapping framework VOOM using high-level objects and low-level points as the hierarchical landmarks in a coarse-to-fine manner instead of directly using object residuals in bundle adjustment. Firstly, we introduce an improved observation model and a novel data association method for dual quadrics, employed to represent physical objects. It facilitates the creation of a 3D map that closely reflects reality. Next, we use object information to enhance the data association of feature points and consequently update the map. In the visual object odometry backend, the updated map is employed to further optimize the camera pose and the objects. Meanwhile, local bundle adjustment is performed utilizing the objects and points-based covisibility graphs in our visual object mapping process. Experiments show that VOOM outperforms both object-oriented SLAM and feature points SLAM systems such as ORB-SLAM2 in terms of localization. The implementation of our method is available at https://github.com/yutongwangBIT/VOOM.git.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables, conference icra 2024 accepted</p></details> |
| **[An Error-Matching Exclusion Method for Accelerating Visual SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14345v2)** | 2024-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Visual SLAM, achieving accurate feature matching consumes a significant amount of time, severely impacting the real-time performance of the system. This paper proposes an accelerated method for Visual SLAM by integrating GMS (Grid-based Motion Statistics) with RANSAC (Random Sample Consensus) for the removal of mismatched features. The approach first utilizes the GMS algorithm to estimate the quantity of matched pairs within the neighborhood and ranks the matches based on their confidence. Subsequently, the Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) algorithm is employed to further eliminate mismatched features. To address the time-consuming issue of randomly selecting all matched pairs, this method transforms it into the problem of prioritizing sample selection from high-confidence matches. This enables the iterative solution of the optimal model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a comparable accuracy to the original GMS-RANSAC while reducing the average runtime by 24.13% on the KITTI, TUM desk, and TUM doll datasets.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, based on a multi-level fine matching strategy, we propose a new feature matching method called KTGP-ORB.

It combines the constraint of local image motion smoothness, uses the GMS algorithm to enhance the accuracy of initial matches, and finally employs the PROSAC algorithm to optimize matches, achieving precise matching based on global grayscale information in Euclidean space. Experimental results demonstrate that the KTGP-ORB method reduces the error by an average of 29.92% compared to the ORB algorithm in complex scenes with illumination variations and blur.</p></details> |  |

As one such use case, drones in GPS-denied environments require equipping with different sensors (e.g., vision sensors) that provide reliable sensing results while performing pose estimation and localization. In this paper, reconstructing the maps of indoor environments alongside generating 3D scene graphs for a high-level representation using a camera mounted on a drone is targeted. Accordingly, an aerial robot equipped with a companion computer and an RGB-D camera was built and employed to be appropriately integrated with a Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (VSLAM) framework proposed by the authors. To enhance the situational awareness of the robot while reconstructing maps, various structural elements, including doors and walls, were labeled with printed fiducial markers, and a dictionary of the topological relations among them was fed to the system. The VSLAM system detects markers and reconstructs the map of the indoor areas enriched with higher-level semantic entities, including corridors and rooms. Another achievement is generating multi-layered vision-based situational graphs containing enhanced hierarchical representations of the indoor environment. In this regard, integrating VSLAM into the employed drone is the primary target of this paper to provide an end-to-end robot application for GPS-denied environments. To show the practicality of the system, various real-world condition experiments have been conducted in indoor scenarios with dissimilar structural layouts. Evaluations show the proposed drone application can perform adequately w.r.t. the ground-truth data and its baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Due to the improvement of CNN-based object detection algorithm, the robustness of visual relocalization is greatly enhanced especially in viewpoints where classical methods fail. However, ellipsoids (quadrics) generated by axis-aligned object detection may limit the accuracy of the object-level representation and degenerate the performance of visual relocalization system. In this paper, we propose a novel method of automatic object-level voxel modeling for accurate ellipsoidal representations of objects. As for visual relocalization, we design a better pose optimization strategy for camera pose recovery, to fully utilize the projection characteristics of 2D fitted ellipses and the 3D accurate ellipsoids. All of these modules are entirely intergrated into visual SLAM system. Experimental results show that our semantic object-level mapping and object-based visual relocalization methods significantly enhance the performance of visual relocalization in terms of robustness to new viewpoints.</p></details> |  |

However, current research faces challenges in accurately localizing and mapping in planar ambiguous scenes, primarily due to the poor accuracy of the employed planar features and data association methods. In this paper, we propose a visual SLAM system based on planar features designed for planar ambiguous scenes, encompassing planar processing, data association, and multi-constraint factor graph optimization. We introduce a planar processing strategy that integrates semantic information with planar features, extracting the edges and vertices of planes to be utilized in tasks such as plane selection, data association, and pose optimization. Next, we present an integrated data association strategy that combines plane parameters, semantic information, projection IoU (Intersection over Union), and non-parametric tests, achieving accurate and robust plane data association in planar ambiguous scenes. Finally, we design a set of multi-constraint factor graphs for camera pose optimization. Qualitative and quantitative experiments conducted on publicly available datasets demonstrate that our proposed system competes effectively in both accuracy and robustness in terms of map construction and camera localization compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional vSLAM systems are limited by the camera's narrow field-of-view, resulting in challenges such as sparse feature distribution and lack of dense depth information. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a 360ORB-SLAM system for panoramic images that combines with a depth completion network. The system extracts feature points from the panoramic image, utilizes a panoramic triangulation module to generate sparse depth information, and employs a depth completion network to obtain a dense panoramic depth map. Experimental results on our novel panoramic dataset constructed based on Carla demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior scale accuracy compared to existing monocular SLAM methods and effectively addresses the challenges of feature association and scale ambiguity. The integration of the depth completion network enhances system stability and mitigates the impact of dynamic elements on SLAM performance.</p></details> | 6 pages, 9 figures |

To achieve robust localization and mapping accuracy, it is imperative to incorporate the perception considerations in the goal selection and path planning towards the goal during an exploration mission. Through this work, we propose FIT-SLAM (Fisher Information and Traversability estimation-based Active SLAM), a new exploration method tailored for unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) to explore 3D environments. This approach is devised with the dual objectives of sustaining an efficient exploration rate while optimizing SLAM accuracy. Initially, an estimation of a global traversability map is conducted, which accounts for the environmental constraints pertaining to traversability. Subsequently, we propose a goal candidate selection approach along with a path planning method towards this goal that takes into account the information provided by the landmarks used by the SLAM backend to achieve robust localization and successful path execution . The entire algorithm is tested and evaluated first in a simulated 3D world, followed by a real-world environment and is compared to pre-existing exploration methods. The results obtained during this evaluation demonstrate a significant increase in the exploration rate while effectively minimizing the localization covariance.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 6 figures, IEEE ICARA 2024</p></details> |

However, the concurrent amalgamation of localization, 3D reconstruction, and semantic segmentation presents a notable hurdle, especially in the context of UAVs equipped with constrained power and computational resources. This paper presents a novel approach to address challenges in semantic information extraction and utilization within UAV operations. Our system integrates state-of-the-art visual SLAM to estimate a comprehensive 6-DoF pose and advanced object segmentation methods at the back end. To improve the computational and storage efficiency of the framework, we adopt a streamlined voxel-based 3D map representation - OctoMap to build a working system. Furthermore, the fusion algorithm is incorporated to obtain the semantic information of each frame from the front-end SLAM task, and the corresponding point. By leveraging semantic information, our framework enhances the UAV's ability to perceive and navigate through indoor spaces, addressing challenges in pose estimation accuracy and uncertainty reduction.

However, its accuracy and especially robustness still suffer from low illumination conditions, illumination changes, and aggressive motion. Event-based cameras are bio-inspired visual sensors that perform well in HDR conditions and have high temporal resolution, and thus provide an interesting alternative in such challenging scenarios. While purely event-based solutions currently do not yet produce satisfying mapping results, the present work demonstrates the feasibility of purely event-based tracking if an alternative sensor is permitted for mapping. The method relies on geometric 3D-2D registration of semi-dense maps and events, and achieves highly reliable and accurate cross-modal tracking results. Practically relevant scenarios are given by depth camera-supported tracking or map-based localization with a semi-dense map prior created by a regular image-based visual SLAM or structure-from-motion system. Conventional edge-based 3D-2D alignment is extended by a novel polarity-aware registration that makes use of signed time-surface maps (STSM) obtained from event streams. We furthermore introduce a novel culling strategy for occluded points. Both modifications increase the speed of the tracker and its robustness against occlusions or large view-point variations. The approach is validated on many real datasets covering the above-mentioned challenging conditions, and compared against similar solutions realised with regular cameras.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by IEEE Transactions on Robotics (T-RO). arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2202.02556</p></details> |

However, it is hard to develop a dedicated algorithm for mobile robots due to dynamic and challenging situations, such as poor lighting conditions and motion blur. To tackle this issue, we propose a tightly-coupled LiDAR-visual SLAM based on geometric features, which includes two sub-systems (LiDAR and monocular visual SLAM) and a fusion framework. The fusion framework associates the depth and semantics of the multi-modal geometric features to complement the visual line landmarks and to add direction optimization in Bundle Adjustment (BA). This further constrains visual odometry. On the other hand, the entire line segment detected by the visual subsystem overcomes the limitation of the LiDAR subsystem, which can only perform the local calculation for geometric features. It adjusts the direction of linear feature points and filters out outliers, leading to a higher accurate odometry system. Finally, we employ a module to detect the subsystem's operation, providing the LiDAR subsystem's output as a complementary trajectory to our system while visual subsystem tracking fails. The evaluation results on the public dataset M2DGR, gathered from ground robots across various indoor and outdoor scenarios, show that our system achieves more accurate and robust pose estimation compared to current state-of-the-art multi-modal methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ROBIO 2023</p></details> |

The primary objective of our work is to address a pivotal question: Does illuminating visual input significantly improve localization accuracy in both semi-dark and dark environments? In contrast to previous works that primarily address partially dim-lit datasets, we comprehensively evaluate various low-light SLAM pipelines across obscurely-lit environments. Employing a meticulous experimental approach, we qualitatively and quantitatively assess different combinations of image enhancers and SLAM frameworks, identifying the best-performing combinations for feature-based visual SLAM. The findings advance low-light SLAM by highlighting the practical implications of enhancing visual input for improved localization accuracy in challenging lighting conditions. This paper also offers valuable insights, encouraging further exploration of visual enhancement strategies for enhanced SLAM performance in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |

This makes any adversarial attacks on vSLAM components potentially detrimental to humans working alongside them. Loop Closure Detection (LCD) is a crucial component in vSLAM that minimizes the accumulation of drift in mapping, since even a small drift can accumulate into a significant drift over time. A prior work by Kim et al., SymbioLCD2, unified visual features and semantic objects into a single graph structure for finding loop closure candidates. While this provided a performance improvement over visual feature-based LCD, it also created a single point of vulnerability for potential graph-based adversarial attacks. Unlike previously reported visual-patch based attacks, small graph perturbations are far more challenging to detect, making them a more significant threat. In this paper, we present Adversarial-LCD, a novel black-box evasion attack framework that employs an eigencentrality-based perturbation method and an SVM-RBF surrogate model with a Weisfeiler-Lehman feature extractor for attacking graph-based LCD. Our evaluation shows that the attack performance of Adversarial-LCD with the SVM-RBF surrogate model was superior to that of other machine learning surrogate algorithms, including SVM-linear, SVM-polynomial, and Bayesian classifier, demonstrating the effectiveness of our attack framework. Furthermore, we show that our eigencentrality-based perturbation method outperforms other algorithms, such as Random-walk and Shortest-path, highlighting the efficiency of Adversarial-LCD's perturbation selection method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at VISIGRAPP 2024, 8 pages</p></details> |

Traditional methods resort to feature matching or point registration for pose optimization, which easily suffers from repetitive features and poor texture quality. In this paper, we present a robust kernel cross-correlator for robust image-level registration. Compared with the existing methods that often use iterative solutions, our method, named non-iterative visual SLAM (NI-SLAM), has a closed-form solution with a complexity of $O(n\log n)$. This allows it to run very efficiently, yet still provide better accuracy and robustness than the state-of-the-art methods. In the experiments, we demonstrate that it achieves 78% improvement over the state-of-the-art systems for indoor and outdoor localization. We have successfully tested it on warehouse robots equipped with a single downward camera, showcasing its product-ready superiority in a real operating area.</p></details> |  |

Existing visual SLAM approaches rely on low-level feature descriptors that are not robust to such environmental changes and result in large map sizes that scale poorly over long-term deployments. In contrast, object detections are robust to environmental variations and lead to more compact representations, but most object-based SLAM systems target short-term indoor deployments with close objects. In this paper, we introduce ObVi-SLAM to overcome these challenges by leveraging the best of both approaches. ObVi-SLAM uses low-level visual features for high-quality short-term visual odometry; and to ensure global, long-term consistency, ObVi-SLAM builds an uncertainty-aware long-term map of persistent objects and updates it after every deployment. By evaluating ObVi-SLAM on data from 16 deployment sessions spanning different weather and lighting conditions, we empirically show that ObVi-SLAM generates accurate localization estimates consistent over long-time scales in spite of varying appearance conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, 1 table plus appendix with 4 figures and 1 table</p></details> |
| **[LF-VISLAM: A SLAM Framework for Large Field-of-View Cameras with Negative Imaging Plane on Mobile Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05167v3)** | 2023-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) has become a crucial aspect in the fields of autonomous driving and robotics. One crucial component of visual SLAM is the Field-of-View (FoV) of the camera, as a larger FoV allows for a wider range of surrounding elements and features to be perceived. However, when the FoV of the camera reaches the negative half-plane, traditional methods for representing image feature points using [u,v,1]^T become ineffective. While the panoramic FoV is advantageous for loop closure, its benefits are not easily realized under large-attitude-angle differences where loop-closure frames cannot be easily matched by existing methods. As loop closure on wide-FoV panoramic data further comes with a large number of outliers, traditional outlier rejection methods are not directly applicable. To address these issues, we propose LF-VISLAM, a Visual Inertial SLAM framework for cameras with extremely Large FoV with loop closure. A three-dimensional vector with unit length is introduced to effectively represent feature points even on the negative half-plane. The attitude information of the SLAM system is leveraged to guide the feature point detection of the loop closure. Additionally, a new outlier rejection method based on the unit length representation is integrated into the loop closure module. We collect the PALVIO dataset using a Panoramic Annular Lens (PAL) system with an entire FoV of 360{\deg}x(40{\deg}~120{\deg}) and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) for Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO) to address the lack of panoramic SLAM datasets.

It allows human operators to see in real-time where robots are located, even if they are not in line of sight. The operator can also visualize the map that the robots create of their environment and can easily send robots to new goal positions. The system mainly consists of a mapping and a control module. The mapping module is a real-time multi-agent visual SLAM system that co-localizes all robots and mixed-reality devices to a common reference frame. Visualizations in the mixed-reality device then allow operators to see a virtual life-sized representation of the cumulative 3D map overlaid onto the real environment. As such, the operator can effectively "see through" walls into other rooms. To control robots and send them to new locations, we propose a drag-and-drop interface. An operator can grab any robot hologram in a 3D mini map and drag it to a new desired goal pose. We validate the proposed system through a user study and real-world deployments. We make the mixed-reality application publicly available at https://github.com/cvg/HoloLens_ros.</p></details> |  |

To tackle these challenges, we take advantage of two popular branches of monocular motion segmentation approaches: point trajectory based and optical flow based methods, by synergistically fusing these two highly complementary motion cues at object level. By doing this, we are able to model various complex object motions in different scene structures at once, which has not been achieved by existing methods. We first obtain object-specific point trajectories and optical flow mask for each common object in the video, by leveraging the recent foundational models in object recognition, segmentation and tracking. We then construct two robust affinity matrices representing the pairwise object motion affinities throughout the whole video using epipolar geometry and the motion information provided by optical flow. Finally, co-regularized multi-view spectral clustering is used to fuse the two affinity matrices and obtain the final clustering. Our method shows state-of-the-art performance on the KT3DMoSeg dataset, which contains complex motions and scene structures. Being able to identify moving objects allows us to remove them for map building when using visual SLAM or SFM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IROS 2023 Workshop on Robotic Perception And Mapping: Frontier Vision and Learning Techniques</p></details> |

In recent years, numerous outstanding research works have proposed effective solutions for the localization problem. However, there has been a scarcity of excellent works focusing on constructing long-term consistent maps in dynamic scenes, which severely hampers map applications. To address this issue, we have designed a multi-level map construction system tailored for dynamic scenes. In this system, we employ multi-object tracking algorithms, DBSCAN clustering algorithm, and depth information to rectify the results of object detection, accurately extract static point clouds, and construct dense point cloud maps and octree maps. We propose a plane map construction algorithm specialized for dynamic scenes, involving the extraction, filtering, data association, and fusion optimization of planes in dynamic environments, thus creating a plane map. Additionally, we introduce an object map construction algorithm targeted at dynamic scenes, which includes object parameterization, data association, and update optimization. Extensive experiments on public datasets and real-world scenarios validate the accuracy of the multi-level maps constructed in this study and the robustness of the proposed algorithms. Furthermore, we demonstrate the practical application prospects of our algorithms by utilizing the constructed object maps for dynamic object tracking.</p></details> |  |

The reason for comparing the SLAM-based approaches leveraging fiducial markers is because previous work has shown their superior performance over feature-only methods, with less computational burden compared to methods that use both feature and marker detection without compromising the localization performance. The evaluation is conducted using indoor image sequences captured with a hand-held camera containing multiple fiducial markers in the environment. The performance metrics include absolute trajectory error and runtime for the optimization process per frame. In particular, for the last two modes (SLAM and localization with a prior map), we evaluate their performances by perturbing the quality of prior map to study the extent to which each mode is tolerant to such perturbations. Hardware experiments show consistent trajectory error levels across the three modes, with the localization mode exhibiting the shortest runtime among them. Yet, with map perturbations, SLAM with a prior map maintains performance, while localization mode degrades in both aspects.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE 2023 IROS Workshop "Closing the Loop on Localization".

Although recent end-to-end methods have demonstrated promising results, tiny structures and geometric boundaries are hardly captured due to their insufficient supervision neglecting spatial details and oversimplified feature fusion ignoring temporal cues. To address the problems, we propose an end-to-end 3D reconstruction network SST, which utilizes Sparse estimated points from visual SLAM system as additional Spatial guidance and fuses Temporal features via a novel cross-modal attention mechanism, achieving more detailed reconstruction results. We propose a Local Spatial-Temporal Fusion module to exploit more informative spatial-temporal cues from multi-view color information and sparse priors, as well a Global Spatial-Temporal Fusion module to refine the local TSDF volumes with the world-frame model from coarse to fine. Extensive experiments on ScanNet and 7-Scenes demonstrate that SST outperforms all state-of-the-art competitors, whilst keeping a high inference speed at 59 FPS, enabling real-world applications with real-time requirements.</p></details> | ICME 2023 (oral) |

To address this issue, this research combines both an existing Visual-Graph SLAM known as ExploreORB with reinforcement learning. The proposed algorithm allows the robot to learn and optimize exploration routes through a reward-based system to create an accurate map of the environment with proper frontier selection. Frontier-based exploration is used to detect unexplored areas, while reinforcement learning optimizes the robot's movement by assigning rewards for optimal frontier points. Graph SLAM is then used to integrate the robot's sensory data and build an accurate map of the environment. The proposed algorithm aims to improve the efficiency and accuracy of ExploreORB by optimizing the exploration process of frontiers to build a more accurate map. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, experiments will be conducted in various virtual environments using Gazebo, a robot simulation software. Results of these experiments will be compared with existing methods to demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach as an optimal solution for SLAM in autonomous robotics.</p></details> | 23 pages, Journal |

To support the research on corner cases of visual SLAM systems, this paper presents Ground-Challenge: a challenging dataset comprising 36 trajectories with diverse corner cases such as aggressive motion, severe occlusion, changing illumination, few textures, pure rotation, motion blur, wheel suspension, etc. The dataset was collected by a ground robot with multiple sensors including an RGB-D camera, an inertial measurement unit (IMU), a wheel odometer and a 3D LiDAR. All of these sensors were well-calibrated and synchronized, and their data were recorded simultaneously. To evaluate the performance of cutting-edge SLAM systems, we tested them on our dataset and demonstrated that these systems are prone to drift and fail on specific sequences. We will release the full dataset and relevant materials upon paper publication to benefit the research community.

| **[OSPC: Online Sequential Photometric Calibration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17673v2)** | 2023-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photometric calibration is essential to many computer vision applications. One of its key benefits is enhancing the performance of Visual SLAM, especially when it depends on a direct method for tracking, such as the standard KLT algorithm. Another advantage could be in retrieving the sensor irradiance values from measured intensities, as a pre-processing step for some vision algorithms, such as shape-from-shading. Current photometric calibration systems rely on a joint optimization problem and encounter an ambiguity in the estimates, which can only be resolved using ground truth information. We propose a novel method that solves for photometric parameters using a sequential estimation approach. Our proposed method achieves high accuracy in estimating all parameters; furthermore, the formulations are linear and convex, which makes the solution fast and suitable for online applications. Experiments on a Visual Odometry system validate the proposed method and demonstrate its advantages.</p></details> |  |

The text object is modeled as a texture-rich planar patch whose semantic meaning is extracted and updated on the fly for better data association. With the full exploration of locally planar characteristics and semantic meaning of text objects, the SLAM system becomes more accurate and robust even under challenging conditions such as image blurring, large viewpoint changes, and significant illumination variations (day and night). We tested our method in various scenes with the ground truth data. The results show that integrating texture features leads to a more superior SLAM system that can match images across day and night. The reconstructed semantic 3D text map could be useful for navigation and scene understanding in robotic and mixed reality applications.

RGB-D SLAM was the design basis for HDPV-SLAM, which added depth information to visual features. It aims to solve the two major issues hindering the performance of similar SLAM systems. The first obstacle is the sparseness of LiDAR depth, which makes it difficult to correlate it with the extracted visual features of the RGB image. A deep learning-based depth estimation module for iteratively densifying sparse LiDAR depth was suggested to address this issue. The second issue pertains to the difficulties in depth association caused by a lack of horizontal overlap between the panoramic camera and the tilted LiDAR sensor. To surmount this difficulty, we present a hybrid depth association module that optimally combines depth information estimated by two independent procedures, feature-based triangulation and depth estimation. During a phase of feature tracking, this hybrid depth association module aims to maximize the use of more accurate depth information between the triangulated depth with visual features tracked and the deep learning-based corrected depth. We evaluated the efficacy of HDPV-SLAM using the 18.95 km-long York University and Teledyne Optech (YUTO) MMS dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that the two proposed modules contribute substantially to the performance of HDPV-SLAM, which surpasses that of the state-of-the-art (SOTA) SLAM systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, To be published in IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE) 2023</p></details> |

In this paper, we introduce LVI-GS, a tightly-coupled LiDAR-Visual-Inertial mapping framework with 3DGS, which leverages the complementary characteristics of LiDAR and image sensors to capture both geometric structures and visual details of 3D scenes. To this end, the 3D Gaussians are initialized from colourized LiDAR points and optimized using differentiable rendering. In order to achieve high-fidelity mapping, we introduce a pyramid-based training approach to effectively learn multi-level features and incorporate depth loss derived from LiDAR measurements to improve geometric feature perception. Through well-designed strategies for Gaussian-Map expansion, keyframe selection, thread management, and custom CUDA acceleration, our framework achieves real-time photo-realistic mapping. Numerical experiments are performed to evaluate the superior performance of our method compared to state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction systems.</p></details> |  |

High accuracy and robustness are essential for the long-term and stable localization capabilities of SLAM systems. Addressing the challenges of enhancing robustness and accuracy in visual-inertial SLAM, this paper propose SuperVINS, a real-time visual-inertial SLAM framework designed for challenging imaging conditions. In contrast to geometric modeling, deep learning features are capable of fully leveraging the implicit information present in images, which is often not captured by geometric features. Therefore, SuperVINS, developed as an enhancement of VINS-Fusion, integrates the deep learning neural network model SuperPoint for feature point extraction and loop closure detection. At the same time, a deep learning neural network LightGlue model for associating feature points is integrated in front-end feature matching. A feature matching enhancement strategy based on the RANSAC algorithm is proposed. The system is allowed to set different masks and RANSAC thresholds for various environments, thereby balancing computational cost and localization accuracy. Additionally, it allows for flexible training of specific SuperPoint bag of words tailored for loop closure detection in particular environments. The system enables real-time localization and mapping. Experimental validation on the well-known EuRoC dataset demonstrates that SuperVINS is comparable to other visual-inertial SLAM system in accuracy and robustness across the most challenging sequences. This paper analyzes the advantages of SuperVINS in terms of accuracy, real-time performance, and robustness. To facilitate knowledge exchange within the field, we have made the code for this paper publicly available.</p></details> |  |

Safe navigation is crucial for all robotics applications and requires accurate and consistent maps of the robot's surroundings. To achieve full autonomy and allow deployment in a wide variety of environments, the robot must rely on on-board state estimation which is prone to drift over time. We propose a Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV) exploration framework based on local submaps to allow retaining global consistency by applying loop-closure corrections to the relative submap poses. To enable large-scale exploration we efficiently compute global, environment-wide frontiers from the local submap frontiers and use a sampling-based next-best-view exploration planner. Our method seamlessly supports using either a LiDAR sensor or a depth camera, making it suitable for different kinds of MAV platforms. We perform comparative evaluations in simulation against a state-of-the-art submap-based exploration framework to showcase the efficiency and reconstruction quality of our approach. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of our method to real-world MAVs, one equipped with a LiDAR and the other with a depth camera.

Hereby depth predictions from a deep neural network are fused in a fully probabilistic manner. Specifically, our method is rigorously uncertainty-aware: first, we use depth and uncertainty predictions from a deep network not only from the robot's stereo rig, but we further probabilistically fuse motion stereo that provides depth information across a range of baselines, therefore drastically increasing mapping accuracy. Next, predicted and fused depth uncertainty propagates not only into occupancy probabilities but also into alignment factors between generated dense submaps that enter the probabilistic nonlinear least squares estimator. This submap representation offers globally consistent geometry at scale. Our method is thoroughly evaluated in two benchmark datasets, resulting in localization and mapping accuracy that exceeds the state of the art, while simultaneously offering volumetric occupancy directly usable for downstream robotic planning and control in real-time.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables, conference</p></details> |

Unlike most popular VINS methods which only use hand-crafted techniques, AB-VINS makes use of three different deep neural networks. Instead of estimating sparse feature positions, AB-VINS only estimates the scale and bias parameters (a and b) of monocular depth maps, as well as other terms to correct the depth using multi-view information, which results in a compressed feature state. Despite being an optimization-based system, the front-end motion tracking thread of AB-VINS surpasses the efficiency of a state-of-the-art filtering-based method while also providing dense depth. When performing loop closures, standard keyframe-based SLAM systems need to relinearize a number of variables which is linear with respect to the number of keyframes. In contrast, the proposed AB-VINS can incorporate loop closures while only affecting a constant number of variables. This is thanks to a novel data structure called the memory tree, where keyframe poses are defined relative to each other rather than all in one global frame, allowing for all but a few states to be fixed. While AB-VINS might not be as accurate as state-of-the-art VINS algorithms, it is shown to be more robust.</p></details> | Submitted to T-RO |
| **[Enhancing Visual Inertial SLAM with Magnetic Measurements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09904v1)** | 2024-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents an extension to visual inertial odometry (VIO) by introducing tightly-coupled fusion of magnetometer measurements. A sliding window of keyframes is optimized by minimizing re-projection errors, relative inertial errors, and relative magnetometer orientation errors. The results of IMU orientation propagation are used to efficiently transform magnetometer measurements between frames producing relative orientation constraints between consecutive frames. The soft and hard iron effects are calibrated using an ellipsoid fitting algorithm. The introduction of magnetometer data results in significant reductions in the orientation error and also in recovery of the true yaw orientation with respect to the magnetic north. The proposed framework operates in all environments with slow-varying magnetic fields, mainly outdoors and underwater. We have focused our work on the underwater domain, especially in underwater caves, as the narrow passage and turbulent flow make it difficult to perform loop closures and reset the localization drift. The underwater caves present challenges to VIO due to the absence of ambient light and the confined nature of the environment, while also being a crucial source of fresh water and providing valuable historical records. Experimental results from underwater caves demonstrate the improvements in accuracy and robustness introduced by the proposed VIO extension.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advancements in Translation Accuracy for Stereo Visual-Inertial Initialization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15082v4)** | 2024-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the current initialization method in the state-of-the-art Stereo Visual-Inertial SLAM framework, ORB-SLAM3 has limitations. Its success depends on the performance of the pure stereo SLAM system and is based on the underlying assumption that pure visual SLAM can accurately estimate the camera trajectory, which is essential for inertial parameter estimation. Meanwhile, the further improved initialization method for ORB-SLAM3, known as Stereo-NEC, is time-consuming due to applying keypoint tracking to estimate gyroscope bias with normal epipolar constraints. To address the limitations of previous methods, this paper proposes a method aimed at enhancing translation accuracy during the initialization stage. The fundamental concept of our method is to improve the translation estimate with a 3 Degree-of-Freedom (DoF) Bundle Adjustment (BA), independently, while the rotation estimate is fixed, instead of using ORB-SLAM3's 6-DoF BA. Additionally, the rotation estimate will be updated by considering IMU measurements and gyroscope bias, unlike ORB-SLAM3's rotation, which is directly obtained from stereo visual odometry and may yield inferior results when operating in challenging scenarios. We also conduct extensive evaluations on the public benchmark, the EuRoC dataset, demonstrating that our method excels in accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Our framework fully exploits the benefits of wide field-of-view from multi-camera systems, and the metric scale measurements provided by an inertial measurement unit (IMU). We introduce an improved IMU pre-integration formulation based on the exponential function of an automorphism of SE_2(3), which can effectively enhance tracking performance under fast rotational motion and extended integration time. Furthermore, we extend conventional front-end tracking and back-end optimization module designed for monocular or stereo setup towards multi-camera systems, and introduce implementation details that contribute to the performance of our system in challenging scenarios. The practical validity of our approach is supported by our experiments on public datasets.

| **[IDLS: Inverse Depth Line based Visual-Inertial SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11748v2)** | 2024-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For robust visual-inertial SLAM in perceptually-challenging indoor environments,recent studies exploit line features to extract descriptive information about scene structure to deal with the degeneracy of point features. But existing point-line-based SLAM methods mainly use Pl\"ucker matrix or orthogonal representation to represent a line, which needs to calculate at least four variables to determine a line. Given the numerous line features to determine in each frame, the overly flexible line representation increases the computation burden and comprises the accuracy of the results. In this paper, we propose inverse depth representation for a line, which models each extracted line feature using only two variables, i.e., the inverse depths of the two ending points. It exploits the fact that the projected line's pixel coordinates on the image plane are rather accurate, which partially restrict the line. Using this compact line presentation, Inverse Depth Line SLAM (IDLS) is proposed to track the line features in SLAM in an accurate and efficient way. A robust line triangulation method and a novel line re-projection error model are introduced. And a two-step optimization method is proposed to firstly determine the lines and then to estimate the camera poses in each frame. IDLS is extensively evaluated in multiple perceptually-challenging datasets. The results show it is more accurate, robust, and needs lower computational overhead than the current state-of-the-art of point-line-based SLAM methods.</p></details> |  |

However, how to make full use of visual information as well as better integrate with inertial measurement unit (IMU) in visual SLAM has potential research value. This paper proposes a novel deep SLAM network with dual visual factors. The basic idea is to integrate both photometric factor and re-projection factor into the end-to-end differentiable structure through multi-factor data association module. We show that the proposed network dynamically learns and adjusts the confidence maps of both visual factors and it can be further extended to include the IMU factors as well. Extensive experiments validate that our proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on several public datasets, including TartanAir, EuRoC and ETH3D-SLAM. Specifically, when dynamically fusing the three factors together, the absolute trajectory error for both monocular and stereo configurations on EuRoC dataset has reduced by 45.3% and 36.2% respectively.</p></details> | Accepted to ICRA2024 |
| **[A Probabilistic-based Drift Correction Module for Visual Inertial SLAMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10140v1)** | 2024-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Positioning is a prominent field of study, notably focusing on Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO) and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) methods. Despite their advancements, these methods often encounter dead-reckoning errors that leads to considerable drift in estimated platform motion especially during long traverses. In such cases, the drift error is not negligible and should be rectified. Our proposed approach minimizes the drift error by correcting the estimated motion generated by any SLAM method at each epoch. Our methodology treats positioning measurements rendered by the SLAM solution as random variables formulated jointly in a multivariate distribution. In this setting, The correction of the drift becomes equivalent to finding the mode of this multivariate distribution which jointly maximizes the likelihood of a set of relevant geo-spatial priors about the platform motion and environment. Our method is integrable into any SLAM/VIO method as an correction module. Our experimental results shows the effectiveness of our approach in minimizing the drift error by 10x in long treverses.</p></details> |  |

The main limitation is the difficulty of obtaining accurate maps at high temporal and spatial resolution as a basis for informed forestry decision-making, due to the vast area forests extend over and the sheer number of trees. To address this challenge, we present an autonomous Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV) system which purely relies on cost-effective and light-weight passive visual and inertial sensors to perform under-canopy autonomous navigation. We leverage visual-inertial simultaneous localization and mapping (VI-SLAM) for accurate MAV state estimates and couple it with a volumetric occupancy submapping system to achieve a scalable mapping framework which can be directly used for path planning. As opposed to a monolithic map, submaps inherently deal with inevitable drift and corrections from VI-SLAM, since they move with pose estimates as they are updated. To ensure the safety of the MAV during navigation, we also propose a novel reference trajectory anchoring scheme that moves and deforms the reference trajectory the MAV is tracking upon state updates from the VI-SLAM system in a consistent way, even upon large changes in state estimates due to loop-closures. We thoroughly validate our system in both real and simulated forest environments with high tree densities in excess of 400 trees per hectare and at speeds up to 3 m/s - while not encountering a single collision or system failure. To the best of our knowledge this is the first system which achieves this level of performance in such unstructured environment using low-cost passive visual sensors and fully on-board computation including VI-SLAM.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |

Unlike the current state-of-the-art method, which heavily relies on the accuracy of a pure visual SLAM system to estimate inertial variables without updating camera poses, potentially compromising accuracy and robustness, our approach offers a different solution. We realize the crucial impact of precise gyroscope bias estimation on rotation accuracy. This, in turn, affects trajectory accuracy due to the accumulation of translation errors. To address this, we first independently estimate the gyroscope bias and use it to formulate a maximum a posteriori problem for further refinement. After this refinement, we proceed to update the rotation estimation by performing IMU integration with gyroscope bias removed from gyroscope measurements. We then leverage robust and accurate rotation estimates to enhance translation estimation via 3-DoF bundle adjustment. Moreover, we introduce a novel approach for determining the success of the initialization by evaluating the residual of the normal epipolar constraint. Extensive evaluations on the EuRoC dataset illustrate that our method excels in accuracy and robustness. It outperforms ORB-SLAM3, the current leading stereo visual-inertial initialization method, in terms of absolute trajectory error and relative rotation error, while maintaining competitive computational speed. Notably, even with 5 keyframes for initialization, our method consistently surpasses the state-of-the-art approach using 10 keyframes in rotation accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Our system relies solely on onboard IMU measurements, stereo infrared images, and depth images and autonomously corrects teleoperated inputs when they are deemed unsafe. We define a point in 3D space as unsafe if it satisfies either of two conditions: (i) it is occupied by an obstacle, or (ii) it remains unmapped. At each time step, an occupancy map of the environment is updated by the VI-SLAM by fusing the onboard measurements, and a CBF is constructed to parameterize the (un)safe region in the 3D space. Given the CBF and state feedback from the VI-SLAM module, a safety filter computes a certified reference that best matches the teleoperation input while satisfying the safety constraint encoded by the CBF. In contrast to existing perception-based safe control frameworks, we directly close the perception-action loop and demonstrate the full capability of safe control in combination with real-time VI-SLAM without any external infrastructure or prior knowledge of the environment. We verify the efficacy of the perceptive safety filter in real-time MAV experiments using exclusively onboard sensing and computation and show that the teleoperated MAV is able to safely navigate through unknown environments despite arbitrary inputs sent by the teleoperator.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) 2024, 7 pages, 7 figures, supplementary video is available at https://youtu.be/rCxbWY4PIfQ?si=DC-9mg7g1WooNdaV</p></details> |

We test our system on photo-realistic simulations and on several real datasets collected on a car prototype developed by the Ford Motor Company, spanning both indoor and outdoor parking scenarios. Our multi-camera system is shown to outperform state-of-the art open-source visual-inertial-SLAM pipelines (Vins-Fusion, ORB-SLAM3), and exhibits an average trajectory error under 1% of the trajectory length across more than 8km of distance traveled (combined across all datasets).

The fusion of camera and inertial measurement unit (IMU) makes up for the shortcomings of a signal sensor, which significantly improves the accuracy and robustness of localization in challenging environments. This article presents PLE-SLAM, an accurate and real-time visual-inertial SLAM algorithm based on point-line features and efficient IMU initialization. First, we use parallel computing methods to extract features and compute descriptors to ensure real-time performance. Adjacent short line segments are merged into long line segments, and isolated short line segments are directly deleted. Second, a rotation-translation-decoupled initialization method is extended to use both points and lines. Gyroscope bias is optimized by tightly coupling IMU measurements and image observations. Accelerometer bias and gravity direction are solved by an analytical method for efficiency. To improve the system's intelligence in handling complex environments, a scheme of leveraging semantic information and geometric constraints to eliminate dynamic features and A solution for loop detection and closed-loop frame pose estimation using CNN and GNN are integrated into the system. All networks are accelerated to ensure real-time performance. The experiment results on public datasets illustrate that PLE-SLAM is one of the state-of-the-art visual-inertial SLAM systems.</p></details> |  |

| **[LF-VISLAM: A SLAM Framework for Large Field-of-View Cameras with Negative Imaging Plane on Mobile Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05167v3)** | 2023-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) has become a crucial aspect in the fields of autonomous driving and robotics. One crucial component of visual SLAM is the Field-of-View (FoV) of the camera, as a larger FoV allows for a wider range of surrounding elements and features to be perceived. However, when the FoV of the camera reaches the negative half-plane, traditional methods for representing image feature points using [u,v,1]^T become ineffective. While the panoramic FoV is advantageous for loop closure, its benefits are not easily realized under large-attitude-angle differences where loop-closure frames cannot be easily matched by existing methods. As loop closure on wide-FoV panoramic data further comes with a large number of outliers, traditional outlier rejection methods are not directly applicable. To address these issues, we propose LF-VISLAM, a Visual Inertial SLAM framework for cameras with extremely Large FoV with loop closure. A three-dimensional vector with unit length is introduced to effectively represent feature points even on the negative half-plane. The attitude information of the SLAM system is leveraged to guide the feature point detection of the loop closure. Additionally, a new outlier rejection method based on the unit length representation is integrated into the loop closure module. We collect the PALVIO dataset using a Panoramic Annular Lens (PAL) system with an entire FoV of 360{\deg}x(40{\deg}~120{\deg}) and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) for Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO) to address the lack of panoramic SLAM datasets. Experiments on the established PALVIO and public datasets show that the proposed LF-VISLAM outperforms state-of-the-art SLAM methods.

| **[EDI: ESKF-based Disjoint Initialization for Visual-Inertial SLAM Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02670v1)** | 2023-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual-inertial initialization can be classified into joint and disjoint approaches. Joint approaches tackle both the visual and the inertial parameters together by aligning observations from feature-bearing points based on IMU integration then use a closed-form solution with visual and acceleration observations to find initial velocity and gravity. In contrast, disjoint approaches independently solve the Structure from Motion (SFM) problem and determine inertial parameters from up-to-scale camera poses obtained from pure monocular SLAM. However, previous disjoint methods have limitations, like assuming negligible acceleration bias impact or accurate rotation estimation by pure monocular SLAM. To address these issues, we propose EDI, a novel approach for fast, accurate, and robust visual-inertial initialization. Our method incorporates an Error-state Kalman Filter (ESKF) to estimate gyroscope bias and correct rotation estimates from monocular SLAM, overcoming dependence on pure monocular SLAM for rotation estimation. To estimate the scale factor without prior information, we offer a closed-form solution for initial velocity, scale, gravity, and acceleration bias estimation. To address gravity and acceleration bias coupling, we introduce weights in the linear least-squares equations, ensuring acceleration bias observability and handling outliers. Extensive evaluation on the EuRoC dataset shows that our method achieves an average scale error of 5.8% in less than 3 seconds, outperforming other state-of-the-art disjoint visual-inertial initialization approaches, even in challenging environments and with artificial noise corruption.</p></details> |  |
| **[PEBO-SLAM: Observer design for visual inertial SLAM with convergence guarantees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12723v1)** | 2023-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a new linear parameterization to the problem of visual inertial simultaneous localization and mapping (VI-SLAM) -- without any approximation -- for the case only using information from a single monocular camera and an inertial measurement unit. In this problem set, the system state evolves on the nonlinear manifold $SE(3)\times \mathbb{R}^{3n}$, on which we design dynamic extensions carefully to generate invariant foliations, such that the problem can be reformulated into online \emph{constant parameter} identification, then interestingly with linear regression models obtained. It demonstrates that VI-SLAM can be translated into a linear least squares problem, in the deterministic sense, \emph{globally} and \emph{exactly}. Based on this observation, we propose a novel SLAM observer, following the recently established parameter estimation-based observer (PEBO) methodology. A notable merit is that the proposed observer enjoys almost global asymptotic stability, requiring neither persistency of excitation nor uniform complete observability, which, however, are widely adopted in most existing works with provable stability but can hardly be assured in many practical scenarios.</p></details> |  |

First, our system directly operates on raw fisheye images, enabling us to fully exploit the wide Field-of-View (FoV) of fisheye cameras. Second, to overcome the low-texture challenge, we explore the tightly-coupled integration of multi-camera inputs and complementary inertial measurements via a unified factor graph and jointly optimize the poses and dense depth maps. Third, for global consistency, the wide FoV of the fisheye camera allows the system to find more potential loop closures, and powered by the broad convergence basin of RFT, our system can perform very wide baseline loop closing with little overlap. Furthermore, we introduce a semi-pose-graph BA method to avoid the expensive full global BA. By combining relative pose factors with loop closure factors, the global states can be adjusted efficiently with modest memory footprint while maintaining high accuracy. Evaluations on TUM-VI, Hilti-Oxford and Newer College datasets show the superior performance of the proposed system over prior works. In the Hilti SLAM Challenge 2022, our VIO version achieves second place. In a subsequent submission, our complete system, including the global BA backend, outperforms the winning approach.</p></details> | Accepted to ICRA2023 |

This task becomes challenging when the problem involves unobservable states. In these situations, it is critical for the algorithm to ``know what it doesn't know'', meaning that it must maintain the unobservable states as unobservable during algorithm deployment.

The paradigm of a centralized architecture is well established, with the robots (i.e. agents) running Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) onboard while communicating relevant data, such as e.g. Keyframes (KFs), to a central back-end (i.e. server), which then merges and optimizes the joint maps of the agents. While these frameworks have proven to be successful, their capability and performance are highly dependent on the choice of the VIO front-end, thus limiting their flexibility. In this work, we present COVINS-G, a generalized back-end building upon the COVINS framework, enabling the compatibility of the server-back-end with any arbitrary VIO front-end, including, for example, off-the-shelf cameras with odometry capabilities, such as the Realsense T265. The COVINS-G back-end deploys a multi-camera relative pose estimation algorithm for computing the loop-closure constraints allowing the system to work purely on 2D image data. In the experimental evaluation, we show on-par accuracy with state-of-the-art multi-session and collaborative SLAM systems, while demonstrating the flexibility and generality of our approach by employing different front-ends onboard collaborating agents within the same mission. The COVINS-G codebase along with a generalized front-end wrapper to allow any existing VIO front-end to be readily used in combination with the proposed collaborative back-end is open-sourced.

A core aspect of UrbanFly is its ability to robustly plan directly on the sparse point clouds generated by a Monocular Visual Inertial SLAM (VINS) backend. It achieves this by using the sparse point clouds to build an uncertainty-integrated cuboid representation of the environment through a data-driven monocular plane segmentation network. Our chosen world model provides faster distance queries than the more common voxel-grid representation, and UrbanFly leverages this capability in two different ways leading to two trajectory optimizers. The first optimizer uses a gradient-free cross-entropy method to compute trajectories that minimize collision probability and smoothness cost. Our second optimizer is a simplified version of the first and uses a sequential convex programming optimizer initialized based on probabilistic safety estimates on a set of randomly drawn trajectories. Both our trajectory optimizers are made computationally tractable and independent of the nature of underlying uncertainty by embedding the distribution of collision violations in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space. Empowered by the algorithmic innovation, UrbanFly outperforms competing baselines in metrics such as collision rate, trajectory length, etc., on a high-fidelity AirSim simulator augmented with synthetic and real-world dataset scenes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ACC 2023, Code available at https://github.com/sudarshan-s-harithas/UrbanFly</p></details> |
| **[DynaVINS: A Visual-Inertial SLAM for Dynamic Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11500v1)** | 2022-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual inertial odometry and SLAM algorithms are widely used in various fields, such as service robots, drones, and autonomous vehicles. Most of the SLAM algorithms are based on assumption that landmarks are static. However, in the real-world, various dynamic objects exist, and they degrade the pose estimation accuracy. In addition, temporarily static objects, which are static during observation but move when they are out of sight, trigger false positive loop closings. To overcome these problems, we propose a novel visual-inertial SLAM framework, called DynaVINS, which is robust against both dynamic objects and temporarily static objects. In our framework, we first present a robust bundle adjustment that could reject the features from dynamic objects by leveraging pose priors estimated by the IMU preintegration. Then, a keyframe grouping and a multi-hypothesis-based constraints grouping methods are proposed to reduce the effect of temporarily static objects in the loop closing. Subsequently, we evaluated our method in a public dataset that contains numerous dynamic objects. Finally, the experimental results corroborate that our DynaVINS has promising performance compared with other state-of-the-art methods by successfully rejecting the effect of dynamic and temporarily static objects.

To achieve that goal, a highly robust and accurate state estimation is indispensable. Combining visual and inertial sensor modalities has proven to yield accurate and locally consistent results in short-term applications. Unfortunately, visual-inertial state estimators suffer from the accumulation of drift for long-term trajectories. To eliminate this drift, global measurements can be fused into the state estimation pipeline. The most known and widely available source of global measurements is the Global Positioning System (GPS). In this paper, we propose a novel approach that fully combines stereo Visual-Inertial Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM), including visual loop closures, with the fusion of global sensor modalities in a tightly-coupled and optimisation-based framework. Incorporating measurement uncertainties, we provide a robust criterion to solve the global reference frame initialisation problem. Furthermore, we propose a loop-closure-like optimisation scheme to compensate drift accumulated during outages in receiving GPS signals. Experimental validation on datasets and in a real-world experiment demonstrates the robustness of our approach to GPS dropouts as well as its capability to estimate highly accurate and globally consistent trajectories compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) 2022</p></details> |

Sparse visual SLAM systems have attained high levels of accuracy and robustness through the inclusion of inertial measurements in a tightly-coupled fusion. Inspired by this performance, we propose the first tightly-coupled dense RGB-D-inertial SLAM system. Our system has real-time capability while running on a GPU. It jointly optimises for the camera pose, velocity, IMU biases and gravity direction while building up a globally consistent, fully dense surfel-based 3D reconstruction of the environment. Through a series of experiments on both synthetic and real world datasets, we show that our dense visual-inertial SLAM system is more robust to fast motions and periods of low texture and low geometric variation than a related RGB-D-only SLAM system.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IROS 2017; supplementary video available at https://youtu.be/-gUdQ0cxDh0</p></details> |

State estimation techniques that rely on non-linear filtering are a strong paradigm for solving the associated information fusion task. The de facto inference method in this space is the celebrated extended Kalman filter (EKF), which relies on first-order linearizations of both the dynamical and measurement model. This paper takes a critical look at the practical implications and limitations posed by the EKF, especially under faulty visual feature associations and the presence of strong confounding noise. As an alternative, we revisit the assumed density formulation of Bayesian filtering and employ a moment matching (unscented Kalman filtering) approach to both visual-inertial odometry and visual SLAM. Our results highlight important aspects in robustness both in dynamics propagation and visual measurement updates, and we show state-of-the-art results on EuRoC MAV drone data benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, to appear in Proceedings of FUSION 2022</p></details> |

Our system leverages a CNN to predict the depth map and the corresponding uncertainty map for each image. The CNN depth effectively bootstraps the back-end optimization of SLAM and meanwhile the CNN uncertainty adaptively weighs the contribution of each feature point to the back-end optimization. Given the gravity direction from the inertial sensor, we further present a fast plane detection method that detects horizontal planes via one-point RANSAC and vertical planes via two-point RANSAC. Those stably detected planes are in turn used to regularize the back-end optimization of SLAM. We evaluate our system on a public dataset, \ie, EuRoC, and demonstrate improved results over a state-of-the-art SLAM system, \ie, ORB-SLAM3.</p></details> |  |

However, real-time performance when incorporating line features in VINS has not been addressed. This paper presents PL-VINS, a real-time optimization-based monocular VINS method with point and line features, developed based on the state-of-the-art point-based VINS-Mono \cite{vins}. We observe that current works use the LSD \cite{lsd} algorithm to extract line features; however, LSD is designed for scene shape representation instead of the pose estimation problem, which becomes the bottleneck for the real-time performance due to its high computational cost. In this paper, a modified LSD algorithm is presented by studying a hidden parameter tuning and length rejection strategy. The modified LSD can run at least three times as fast as LSD. Further, by representing space lines with the Pl\"{u}cker coordinates, the residual error in line estimation is modeled in terms of the point-to-line distance, which is then minimized by iteratively updating the minimum four-parameter orthonormal representation of the Pl\"{u}cker coordinates. Experiments in a public benchmark dataset show that the localization error of our method is 12-16\% less than that of VINS-Mono at the same pose update frequency. %For the benefit of the community, The source code of our method is available at: https://github.com/cnqiangfu/PL-VINS.</p></details> | <details><summary>Visua...</summary><p>Visual-Inertial SLAM, LSD, Lines, SLAM, VINS-Mono</p></details> |

These depth sensors, however, suffer from stereo artefacts and do not provide dense depth estimates.In this work, we present the first self-supervised depth completion method for active stereo systems that predicts accurate dense depth maps. Our system leverages a feature-based visual inertial SLAM system to produce motion estimates and accurate (but sparse) 3D landmarks. The 3D landmarks are used both as model input and as supervision during training. The motion estimates are used in our novel reconstruction loss that relies on a combination of passive and active stereo frames, resulting in significant improvements in textureless areas that are common in indoor environments. Due to the nonexistence of publicly available active stereo datasets, we release a real dataset together with additional information for a publicly available synthetic dataset (TartanAir [42]) needed for active depth completion and prediction. Through rigorous evaluations we show that our method outperforms state of the art on both datasets. Additionally we show how our method obtains more complete, and therefore safer, 3D maps when used in a robotic platform.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to RAL-ICRA 21</p></details> |

This mental model captures geometric and semantic aspects of the scene, describes the environment at multiple levels of abstractions (e.g., objects, rooms, buildings), includes static and dynamic entities and their relations (e.g., a person is in a room at a given time). In contrast, current robots' internal representations still provide a partial and fragmented understanding of the environment, either in the form of a sparse or dense set of geometric primitives (e.g., points, lines, planes, voxels) or as a collection of objects. This paper attempts to reduce the gap between robot and human perception by introducing a novel representation, a 3D Dynamic Scene Graph(DSG), that seamlessly captures metric and semantic aspects of a dynamic environment. A DSG is a layered graph where nodes represent spatial concepts at different levels of abstraction, and edges represent spatio-temporal relations among nodes. Our second contribution is Kimera, the first fully automatic method to build a DSG from visual-inertial data. Kimera includes state-of-the-art techniques for visual-inertial SLAM, metric-semantic 3D reconstruction, object localization, human pose and shape estimation, and scene parsing. Our third contribution is a comprehensive evaluation of Kimera in real-life datasets and photo-realistic simulations, including a newly released dataset, uHumans2, which simulates a collection of crowded indoor and outdoor scenes. Our evaluation shows that Kimera achieves state-of-the-art performance in visual-inertial SLAM, estimates an accurate 3D metric-semantic mesh model in real-time, and builds a DSG of a complex indoor environment with tens of objects and humans in minutes. Our final contribution shows how to use a DSG for real-time hierarchical semantic path-planning.

This article presents COVINS, a novel collaborative SLAM system, that enables multi-agent, scalable SLAM in large environments and for large teams of more than 10 agents. The paradigm here is that each agent runs visual-inertial odomety independently onboard in order to ensure its autonomy, while sharing map information with the COVINS server back-end running on a powerful local PC or a remote cloud server. The server back-end establishes an accurate collaborative global estimate from the contributed data, refining the joint estimate by means of place recognition, global optimization and removal of redundant data, in order to ensure an accurate, but also efficient SLAM process. A thorough evaluation of COVINS reveals increased accuracy of the collaborative SLAM estimates, as well as efficiency in both removing redundant information and reducing the coordination overhead, and demonstrates successful operation in a large-scale mission with 12 agents jointly performing SLAM.</p></details> |  |

Multi-agent cooperative SLAM is the precondition of multi-user AR interaction. The cooperation of multiple smart phones has the potential to improve efficiency and robustness of task completion and can complete tasks that a single agent cannot do. However, it depends on robust communication, efficient location detection, robust mapping, and efficient information sharing among agents. We propose a multi-intelligence collaborative monocular visual-inertial SLAM deployed on multiple ios mobile devices with a centralized architecture. Each agent can independently explore the environment, run a visual-inertial odometry module online, and then send all the measurement information to a central server with higher computing resources. The server manages all the information received, detects overlapping areas, merges and optimizes the map, and shares information with the agents when needed. We have verified the performance of the system in public datasets and real environments.

Thanks to it, ORB-SLAM3 is able to survive to long periods of poor visual information: when it gets lost, it starts a new map that will be seamlessly merged with previous maps when revisiting mapped areas. Compared with visual odometry systems that only use information from the last few seconds, ORB-SLAM3 is the first system able to reuse in all the algorithm stages all previous information. This allows to include in bundle adjustment co-visible keyframes, that provide high parallax observations boosting accuracy, even if they are widely separated in time or if they come from a previous mapping session. Our experiments show that, in all sensor configurations, ORB-SLAM3 is as robust as the best systems available in the literature, and significantly more accurate. Notably, our stereo-inertial SLAM achieves an average accuracy of 3.6 cm on the EuRoC drone and 9 mm under quick hand-held motions in the room of TUM-VI dataset, a setting representative of AR/VR scenarios. For the benefit of the community we make public the source code.</p></details> |  |
| **[Consistent Right-Invariant Fixed-Lag Smoother with Application to Visual Inertial SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.08596v2)** | 2021-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State estimation problems without absolute position measurements routinely arise in navigation of unmanned aerial vehicles, autonomous ground vehicles, etc., whose proper operation relies on accurate state estimates and reliable covariances. Unaware of absolute positions, these problems have immanent unobservable directions. Traditional causal estimators, however, usually gain spurious information on the unobservable directions, leading to over-confident covariance inconsistent with actual estimator errors. The consistency problem of fixed-lag smoothers (FLSs) has only been attacked by the first estimate Jacobian (FEJ) technique because of the complexity to analyze their observability property. But the FEJ has several drawbacks hampering its wide adoption. To ensure the consistency of a FLS, this paper introduces the right invariant error formulation into the FLS framework. To our knowledge, we are the first to analyze the observability of a FLS with the right invariant error. Our main contributions are twofold. As the first novelty, to bypass the complexity of analysis with the classic observability matrix, we show that observability analysis of FLSs can be done equivalently on the linearized system. Second, we prove that the inconsistency issue in the traditional FLS can be elegantly solved by the right invariant error formulation without artificially correcting Jacobians. By applying the proposed FLS to the monocular visual inertial simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem, we confirm that the method consistently estimates covariance similarly to a batch smoother in simulation and that our method achieved comparable accuracy as traditional FLSs on real data.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 4 figures, AAAI 2021 Conference</p></details> |
| **[Accurate Visual-Inertial SLAM by Feature Re-identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.13438v1)** | 2021-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel feature re-identification method for real-time visual-inertial SLAM. The front-end module of the state-of-the-art visual-inertial SLAM methods (e.g. visual feature extraction and matching schemes) relies on feature tracks across image frames, which are easily broken in challenging scenarios, resulting in insufficient visual measurement and accumulated error in pose estimation. In this paper, we propose an efficient drift-less SLAM method by re-identifying existing features from a spatial-temporal sensitive sub-global map. The re-identified features over a long time span serve as augmented visual measurements and are incorporated into the optimization module which can gradually decrease the accumulative error in the long run, and further build a drift-less global map in the system. Extensive experiments show that our feature re-identification method is both effective and efficient. Specifically, when combining the feature re-identification with the state-of-the-art SLAM method [11], our method achieves 67.3% and 87.5% absolute translation error reduction with only a small additional computational cost on two public SLAM benchmark DBs: EuRoC and TUM-VI respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, Submitted to ICRA2021</p></details> |

In this paper, firstly we perform an observability analysis w.r.t. the extrinsic parameters before the first turning, which is a complement of the existing results of observability analyses. Secondly, inspired by the above observability analyses, we propose a bidirectional trajectory computation method, by which the poses before the first turning are refined in the backward computation thread, and the real-time trajectory is adjusted accordingly. Experimental results prove that our proposed method not only solves the problem of the unobservability of accelerometer bias and extrinsic parameters before the first turning, but also results in more accurate trajectories in comparison with the state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters</p></details> |

Specifically, in order to achieve real-time operation, existing approaches often assume previously-estimated states to be perfectly known, which leads to inconsistent estimates. Instead, based on the idea of the Schmidt-Kalman filter, which has processing cost linear in the size of the state vector but quadratic memory requirements, we derive a new consistent approximate method in the information domain, which has linear memory requirements and adjustable (constant to linear) processing cost. In particular, this method, the resource-aware inverse Schmidt estimator (RISE), allows trading estimation accuracy for computational efficiency. Furthermore, and in order to better address the requirements of a SLAM system during an exploration vs. a relocalization phase, we employ different configurations of RISE (in terms of the number and order of states updated) to maximize accuracy while preserving efficiency. Lastly, we evaluate the proposed RISE-SLAM algorithm on publicly-available datasets and demonstrate its superiority, both in terms of accuracy and efficiency, as compared to alternative visual-inertial SLAM systems.</p></details> | IROS 2019 |
| **[Deep Depth Estimation from Visual-Inertial SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.00092v2)** | 2020-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the problem of learning to complete a scene's depth from sparse depth points and images of indoor scenes. Specifically, we study the case in which the sparse depth is computed from a visual-inertial simultaneous localization and mapping (VI-SLAM) system. The resulting point cloud has low density, it is noisy, and has non-uniform spatial distribution, as compared to the input from active depth sensors, e.g., LiDAR or Kinect. Since the VI-SLAM produces point clouds only over textured areas, we compensate for the missing depth of the low-texture surfaces by leveraging their planar structures and their surface normals which is an important intermediate representation. The pre-trained surface normal network, however, suffers from large performance degradation when there is a significant difference in the viewing direction (especially the roll angle) of the test image as compared to the trained ones. To address this limitation, we use the available gravity estimate from the VI-SLAM to warp the input image to the orientation prevailing in the training dataset. This results in a significant performance gain for the surface normal estimate, and thus the dense depth estimates. Finally, we show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches both on training (ScanNet and NYUv2) and testing (collected with Azure Kinect) datasets.</p></details> | 9 pages |

Scene graphs are directed graphs where nodes represent entities in the scene (e.g. objects, walls, rooms), and edges represent relations (e.g. inclusion, adjacency) among nodes. Dynamic scene graphs (DSGs) extend this notion to represent dynamic scenes with moving agents (e.g. humans, robots), and to include actionable information that supports planning and decision-making (e.g. spatio-temporal relations, topology at different levels of abstraction). Our second contribution is to provide the first fully automatic Spatial PerceptIon eNgine(SPIN) to build a DSG from visual-inertial data. We integrate state-of-the-art techniques for object and human detection and pose estimation, and we describe how to robustly infer object, robot, and human nodes in crowded scenes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that reconciles visual-inertial SLAM and dense human mesh tracking. Moreover, we provide algorithms to obtain hierarchical representations of indoor environments (e.g. places, structures, rooms) and their relations. Our third contribution is to demonstrate the proposed spatial perception engine in a photo-realistic Unity-based simulator, where we assess its robustness and expressiveness. Finally, we discuss the implications of our proposal on modern robotics applications. 3D Dynamic Scene Graphs can have a profound impact on planning and decision-making, human-robot interaction, long-term autonomy, and scene prediction.

| **[Monocular visual-inertial SLAM algorithm combined with wheel speed anomaly detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.09901v1)** | 2020-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To address the weak observability of monocular visual-inertial odometers on ground-based mobile robots, this paper proposes a monocular inertial SLAM algorithm combined with wheel speed anomaly detection. The algorithm uses a wheel speed odometer pre-integration method to add the wheel speed measurement to the least-squares problem in a tightly coupled manner. For abnormal motion situations, such as skidding and abduction, this paper adopts the Mecanum mobile chassis control method, based on torque control. This method uses the motion constraint error to estimate the reliability of the wheel speed measurement. At the same time, in order to prevent incorrect chassis speed measurements from negatively influencing robot pose estimation, this paper uses three methods to detect abnormal chassis movement and analyze chassis movement status in real time. When the chassis movement is determined to be abnormal, the wheel odometer pre-integration measurement of the current frame is removed from the state estimation equation, thereby ensuring the accuracy and robustness of the state estimation. Experimental results show that the accuracy and robustness of the method in this paper are better than those of a monocular visual-inertial odometer.</p></details> |  |

Conventionally, the performance of visual-inertial SLAM is evaluated with open-loop analysis, with a focus on the drift level of SLAM systems. In this paper, we raise the question on the importance of visual estimation latency in closed-loop navigation tasks, such as accurate trajectory tracking. To understand the impact of both drift and latency on visual-inertial SLAM systems, a closed-loop benchmarking simulation is conducted, where a robot is commanded to follow a desired trajectory using the feedback from visual-inertial estimation. By extensively evaluating the trajectory tracking performance of representative state-of-the-art visual-inertial SLAM systems, we reveal the importance of latency reduction in visual estimation module of these systems. The findings suggest directions of future improvements for visual-inertial SLAM.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures.

The library goes beyond existing visual and visual-inertial SLAM libraries (e.g., ORB-SLAM, VINS- Mono, OKVIS, ROVIO) by enabling mesh reconstruction and semantic labeling in 3D. Kimera is designed with modularity in mind and has four key components: a visual-inertial odometry (VIO) module for fast and accurate state estimation, a robust pose graph optimizer for global trajectory estimation, a lightweight 3D mesher module for fast mesh reconstruction, and a dense 3D metric-semantic reconstruction module. The modules can be run in isolation or in combination, hence Kimera can easily fall back to a state-of-the-art VIO or a full SLAM system. Kimera runs in real-time on a CPU and produces a 3D metric-semantic mesh from semantically labeled images, which can be obtained by modern deep learning methods. We hope that the flexibility, computational efficiency, robustness, and accuracy afforded by Kimera will build a solid basis for future metric-semantic SLAM and perception research, and will allow researchers across multiple areas (e.g., VIO, SLAM, 3D reconstruction, segmentation) to benchmark and prototype their own efforts without having to start from scratch.</p></details> | 8 pages |

Extending visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) with other modalities such as an inertial measurement unit (IMU) can boost robustness and accuracy. However, for a tight sensor fusion, accurate time synchronization of the sensors is often crucial. Changing exposure times, internal sensor filtering, multiple clock sources and unpredictable delays from operation system scheduling and data transfer can make sensor synchronization challenging. In this paper, we present VersaVIS, an Open Versatile Multi-Camera Visual-Inertial Sensor Suite aimed to be an efficient research platform for easy deployment, integration and extension for many mobile robotic applications. VersaVIS provides a complete, open-source hardware, firmware and software bundle to perform time synchronization of multiple cameras with an IMU featuring exposure compensation, host clock translation and independent and stereo camera triggering. The sensor suite supports a wide range of cameras and IMUs to match the requirements of the application. The synchronization accuracy of the framework is evaluated on multiple experiments achieving timing accuracy of less than 1 ms. Furthermore, the applicability and versatility of the sensor suite is demonstrated in multiple applications including visual-inertial SLAM, multi-camera applications, multimodal mapping, reconstruction and object based mapping.</p></details> |  |

In this paper we build on the initialization method proposed by Martinelli and extended by Kaiser et al. , modifying it to be more general and efficient. We improve accuracy with several rounds of visual-inertial bundle adjustment, and robustify the method with novel observability and consensus tests, that discard erroneous solutions. Our results on the EuRoC dataset show that, while the original method produces scale errors up to 156%, our method is able to consistently initialize in less than two seconds with scale errors around 5%, which can be further reduced to less than 1% performing visual-inertial bundle adjustment after ten seconds.</p></details> | <details><summary>2019 ...</summary><p>2019 International Conference on Robotics and Automation</p></details> |

Finally, we present the fully functional system with relative computation andhandling of multiple world co-ordinate system which is able to reduce odometry drift, recover fromcomplicated kidnap scenarios and random odometry failures. We open source our fully functional system as an add-on for the popular VINS-Fusion.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a novel, high-precision, efficient visual-inertial (VI)-SLAM algorithm, termed Schmidt-EKF VI-SLAM (SEVIS), which optimally fuses IMU measurements and monocular images in a tightly-coupled manner to provide 3D motion tracking with bounded error. In particular, we adapt the Schmidt Kalman filter formulation to selectively include informative features in the state vector while treating them as nuisance parameters (or Schmidt states) once they become matured. This change in modeling allows for significant computational savings by no longer needing to constantly update the Schmidt states (or their covariance), while still allowing the EKF to correctly account for their cross-correlations with the active states. As a result, we achieve linear computational complexity in terms of map size, instead of quadratic as in the standard SLAM systems. In order to fully exploit the map information to bound navigation drifts, we advocate efficient keyframe-aided 2D-to-2D feature matching to find reliable correspondences between current 2D visual measurements and 3D map features. The proposed SEVIS is extensively validated in both simulations and experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 2019 Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)</p></details> |
| **[Observability Analysis of Aided INS with Heterogeneous Features of Points, Lines and Planes](http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.05876v1)** | 2018-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we perform a thorough observability analysis for linearized inertial navigation systems (INS) aided by exteroceptive range and/or bearing sensors (such as cameras, LiDAR and sonars) with different geometric features (points, lines and planes). While the observability of vision-aided INS (VINS) with point features has been extensively studied in the literature, we analytically show that the general aided INS with point features preserves the same observability property: that is, 4 unobservable directions, corresponding to the global yaw and the global position of the sensor platform. We further prove that there are at least 5 (and 7) unobservable directions for the linearized aided INS with a single line (and plane) feature; and, for the first time, analytically derive the unobservable subspace for the case of multiple lines/planes. Building upon this, we examine the system observability of the linearized aided INS with different combinations of points, lines and planes, and show that, in general, the system preserves at least 4 unobservable directions, while if global measurements are available, as expected, some unobservable directions diminish. In particular, when using plane features, we propose to use a minimal, closest point (CP) representation; and we also study in-depth the effects of 5 degenerate motions identified on observability. To numerically validate our analysis, we develop and evaluate both EKF-based visual-inertial SLAM and visual-inertial odometry (VIO) using heterogeneous geometric features in Monte Carlo simulations.</p></details> |  |

This is achieved by firstly performing the visual-inertial extended kalman filter(EKF) to provide motion estimate at a high rate. However the filter becomes inconsistent due to the well known linearization issues. So we perform a keyframe-based visual-inertial bundle adjustment to improve the consistency and accuracy of the system. In addition, a loop closure detection and correction module is also added to eliminate the accumulated drift when revisiting an area. Finally, the optimized motion estimates and map are fed back to the EKF-based visual-inertial odometry module, thus the inconsistency and estimation error of the EKF estimator are reduced. In this way, the system can continuously provide reliable motion estimates for the long-term operation. The performance of the algorithm is validated on public datasets and real-world experiments, which proves the superiority of the proposed algorithm.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures |

However, such locally accurate visual-inertial odometry is prone to drift and cannot provide absolute pose estimation. Leveraging history information to relocalize and correct drift has become a hot topic. In this paper, we propose a monocular visual-inertial SLAM system, which can relocalize camera and get the absolute pose in a previous-built map. Then 4-DOF pose graph optimization is performed to correct drifts and achieve global consistent. The 4-DOF contains x, y, z, and yaw angle, which is the actual drifted direction in the visual-inertial system. Furthermore, the proposed system can reuse a map by saving and loading it in an efficient way. Current map and previous map can be merged together by the global pose graph optimization. We validate the accuracy of our system on public datasets and compare against other state-of-the-art algorithms. We also evaluate the map merging ability of our system in the large-scale outdoor environment. The source code of map reuse is integrated into our public code, VINS-Mono.</p></details> | 8 pages |

| **[ESVO2: Direct Visual-Inertial Odometry with Stereo Event Cameras](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09374v2)** | 2025-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event-based visual odometry is a specific branch of visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) techniques, which aims at solving tracking and mapping subproblems (typically in parallel), by exploiting the special working principles of neuromorphic (i.e., event-based) cameras. Due to the motion-dependent nature of event data, explicit data association (i.e., feature matching) under large-baseline view-point changes is difficult to establish, making direct methods a more rational choice. However, state-of-the-art direct methods are limited by the high computational complexity of the mapping sub-problem and the degeneracy of camera pose tracking in certain degrees of freedom (DoF) in rotation. In this paper, we tackle these issues by building an event-based stereo visual-inertial odometry system on top of a direct pipeline. Specifically, to speed up the mapping operation, we propose an efficient strategy for sampling contour points according to the local dynamics of events. The mapping performance is also improved in terms of structure completeness and local smoothness by merging the temporal stereo and static stereo results. To circumvent the degeneracy of camera pose tracking in recovering the pitch and yaw components of general 6-DoF motion, we introduce IMU measurements as motion priors via pre-integration. To this end, a compact back-end is proposed for continuously updating the IMU bias and predicting the linear velocity, enabling an accurate motion prediction for camera pose tracking. The resulting system scales well with modern high-resolution event cameras and leads to better global positioning accuracy in large-scale outdoor environments. Extensive evaluations on five publicly available datasets featuring different resolutions and scenarios justify the superior performance of the proposed system against five state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[VINGS-Mono: Visual-Inertial Gaussian Splatting Monocular SLAM in Large Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08286v1)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>VINGS-Mono is a monocular (inertial) Gaussian Splatting (GS) SLAM framework designed for large scenes. The framework comprises four main components: VIO Front End, 2D Gaussian Map, NVS Loop Closure, and Dynamic Eraser. In the VIO Front End, RGB frames are processed through dense bundle adjustment and uncertainty estimation to extract scene geometry and poses. Based on this output, the mapping module incrementally constructs and maintains a 2D Gaussian map. Key components of the 2D Gaussian Map include a Sample-based Rasterizer, Score Manager, and Pose Refinement, which collectively improve mapping speed and localization accuracy. This enables the SLAM system to handle large-scale urban environments with up to 50 million Gaussian ellipsoids. To ensure global consistency in large-scale scenes, we design a Loop Closure module, which innovatively leverages the Novel View Synthesis (NVS) capabilities of Gaussian Splatting for loop closure detection and correction of the Gaussian map. Additionally, we propose a Dynamic Eraser to address the inevitable presence of dynamic objects in real-world outdoor scenes. Extensive evaluations in indoor and outdoor environments demonstrate that our approach achieves localization performance on par with Visual-Inertial Odometry while surpassing recent GS/NeRF SLAM methods. It also significantly outperforms all existing methods in terms of mapping and rendering quality. Furthermore, we developed a mobile app and verified that our framework can generate high-quality Gaussian maps in real time using only a smartphone camera and a low-frequency IMU sensor. To the best of our knowledge, VINGS-Mono is the first monocular Gaussian SLAM method capable of operating in outdoor environments and supporting kilometer-scale large scenes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Versatile Locomotion Skills for Hexapod Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10628v1)** | 2024-12-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hexapod robots are potentially suitable for carrying out tasks in cluttered environments since they are stable, compact, and light weight. They also have multi-joint legs and variable height bodies that make them good candidates for tasks such as stairs climbing and squeezing under objects in a typical home environment or an attic. Expanding on our previous work on joist climbing in attics, we train a legged hexapod equipped with a depth camera and visual inertial odometry (VIO) to perform three tasks: climbing stairs, avoiding obstacles, and squeezing under obstacles such as a table. Our policies are trained with simulation data only and can be deployed on lowcost hardware not requiring real-time joint state feedback. We train our model in a teacher-student model with 2 phases: In phase 1, we use reinforcement learning with access to privileged information such as height maps and joint feedback. In phase 2, we use supervised learning to distill the model into one with access to only onboard observations, consisting of egocentric depth images and robot pose captured by a tracking VIO camera. By manipulating available privileged information, constructing simulation terrains, and refining reward functions during phase 1 training, we are able to train the robots with skills that are robust in non-ideal physical environments. We demonstrate successful sim-to-real transfer and achieve high success rates across all three tasks in physical experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Drift-free Visual SLAM using Digital Twins](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08496v2)** | 2024-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Globally-consistent localization in urban environments is crucial for autonomous systems such as self-driving vehicles and drones, as well as assistive technologies for visually impaired people. Traditional Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) and Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (VSLAM) methods, though adequate for local pose estimation, suffer from drift in the long term due to reliance on local sensor data. While GPS counteracts this drift, it is unavailable indoors and often unreliable in urban areas. An alternative is to localize the camera to an existing 3D map using visual-feature matching. This can provide centimeter-level accurate localization but is limited by the visual similarities between the current view and the map. This paper introduces a novel approach that achieves accurate and globally-consistent localization by aligning the sparse 3D point cloud generated by the VIO/VSLAM system to a digital twin using point-to-plane matching; no visual data association is needed. The proposed method provides a 6-DoF global measurement tightly integrated into the VIO/VSLAM system. Experiments run on a high-fidelity GPS simulator and real-world data collected from a drone demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art VIO-GPS systems and offers superior robustness against viewpoint changes compared to the state-of-the-art Visual SLAM systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Aerial Collaborative Stereo: Real-Time Cross-Camera Feature Association and Relative Pose Estimation for UAVs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17504v2)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The collaborative visual perception of multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has increasingly become a research hotspot. Compared to a single UAV equipped with a short-baseline stereo camera, multi-UAV collaborative vision offers a wide and variable baseline, providing potential benefits in flexible and large-scale depth perception. In this paper, we propose the concept of a collaborative stereo camera, where the left and right cameras are mounted on two UAVs that share an overlapping FOV. Considering the dynamic flight of two UAVs in the real world, the FOV and relative pose of the left and right cameras are continuously changing. Compared to fixed-baseline stereo cameras, this aerial collaborative stereo system introduces two challenges, which are highly real-time requirements for dynamic cross-camera stereo feature association and relative pose estimation of left and right cameras. To address these challenges, we first propose a real-time dual-channel feature association algorithm with a guidance-prediction structure. Then, we propose a Relative Multi-State Constrained Kalman Filter (Rel-MSCKF) algorithm to estimate the relative pose by fusing co-visual features and UAVs' visual-inertial odometry (VIO). Extensive experiments are performed on the popular onboard computer NVIDIA NX. Results on the resource-constrained platform show that the real-time performance of the dual-channel feature association is significantly superior to traditional methods. The convergence of Rel-MSCKF is assessed under different initial baseline errors. In the end, we present a potential application of aerial collaborative stereo for remote mapping obstacles in urban scenarios. We hope this work can serve as a foundational study for more multi-UAV collaborative vision research. Online video: https://youtu.be/avxMuOf5Qcw</p></details> | 13 pages |
| **[DOGE: An Extrinsic Orientation and Gyroscope Bias Estimation for Visual-Inertial Odometry Initialization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08135v1)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most existing visual-inertial odometry (VIO) initialization methods rely on accurate pre-calibrated extrinsic parameters. However, during long-term use, irreversible structural deformation caused by temperature changes, mechanical squeezing, etc. will cause changes in extrinsic parameters, especially in the rotational part. Existing initialization methods that simultaneously estimate extrinsic parameters suffer from poor robustness, low precision, and long initialization latency due to the need for sufficient translational motion. To address these problems, we propose a novel VIO initialization method, which jointly considers extrinsic orientation and gyroscope bias within the normal epipolar constraints, achieving higher precision and better robustness without delayed rotational calibration. First, a rotation-only constraint is designed for extrinsic orientation and gyroscope bias estimation, which tightly couples gyroscope measurements and visual observations and can be solved in pure-rotation cases. Second, we propose a weighting strategy together with a failure detection strategy to enhance the precision and robustness of the estimator. Finally, we leverage Maximum A Posteriori to refine the results before enough translation parallax comes. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and robustness while maintaining competitive efficiency.</p></details> |  |

These environments are typically challenging for conventional vision-based state estimation due to the lack of distinct visual landmarks and the instability of vehicle poses. To address this, BEVRender generates high-quality local bird's-eye-view(BEV) images of the local terrain. Subsequently, these images are aligned with a geo referenced aerial map through template matching to achieve accurate cross-view registration. Our approach overcomes the inherent limitations of visual inertial odometry systems and the substantial storage requirements of image-retrieval localization strategies, which are susceptible to drift and scalability issues, respectively. Extensive experimentation validates BEVRender's advancement over existing GNSS-denied visual localization methods, demonstrating notable enhancements in both localization accuracy and update frequency.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, accepted by IROS2024</p></details> |

Most VIO methods presuppose that observed objects are static and time-invariant. However, real-world scenes often feature dynamic objects, compromising the accuracy of pose estimation. These moving entities include cars, trucks, buses, motorcycles, and pedestrians. The diversity and partial occlusion of these objects present a tough challenge for existing dynamic object removal techniques. To tackle this challenge, we introduce GMS-VINS, which integrates an enhanced SORT algorithm along with a robust multi-category segmentation framework into VIO, thereby improving pose estimation accuracy in environments with diverse dynamic objects and frequent occlusions. Leveraging the promptable foundation model, our solution efficiently tracks and segments a wide range of object categories. The enhanced SORT algorithm significantly improves the reliability of tracking multiple dynamic objects, especially in urban settings with partial occlusions or swift movements. We evaluated our proposed method using multiple public datasets representing various scenes, as well as in a real-world scenario involving diverse dynamic objects. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method performs impressively in multiple scenarios, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods. This highlights its remarkable generalization and adaptability in diverse dynamic environments, showcasing its potential to handle various dynamic objects in practical applications.</p></details> |  |

The cutting-edge DU-VIO framework is incorporating a GAN-based pre-processing module and a hybrid CNN-LSTM module for precise pose estimation, using visibility-enhanced underwater images and raw IMU data. Accurate pose estimation is paramount for various underwater robotics and exploration applications. However, underwater visibility is often compromised by suspended particles and attenuation effects, rendering visual-inertial pose estimation a formidable challenge. DU-VIO aims to overcome these limitations by effectively removing visual disturbances from raw image data, enhancing the quality of image features used for pose estimation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DU-VIO by calculating RMSE scores for translation and rotation vectors in comparison to their reference values. These scores are then compared to those of a base model using a modified AQUALOC Dataset. This study's significance lies in its potential to revolutionize underwater robotics and exploration. DU-VIO offers a robust solution to the persistent challenge of underwater visibility, significantly improving the accuracy of pose estimation. This research contributes valuable insights and tools for advancing underwater technology, with far-reaching implications for scientific research, environmental monitoring, and industrial applications.</p></details> |  |

However, the filter-based method has the problem of insufficient accuracy. To this end, we propose the State transformation and Pose-only VIO (SP-VIO) by rebuilding the state and measurement models, and considering further visual deprived conditions. In detail, we first proposed a system model based on the double state transformation extended Kalman filter (DST-EKF), which has been proven to have better observability and consistency than the models based on extended Kalman filter (EKF) and state transformation extended Kalman filter (ST-EKF). Secondly, to reduce the influence of linearization error caused by inaccurate 3D reconstruction, we adopt the Pose-only (PO) theory to decouple the measurement model from 3D features. Moreover, to deal with visual deprived conditions, we propose a double state transformation Rauch-Tung-Striebel (DST-RTS) backtracking method to optimize motion trajectories during visual interruption. Experiments on public (EuRoC, Tum-VI, KITTI) and personal datasets show that SP-VIO has better accuracy and efficiency than state-of-the-art (SOTA) VIO algorithms, and has better robustness under visual deprived conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Improved Multi-State Constraint Kalman Filter for Visual-Inertial Odometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08117v2)** | 2024-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fast pose estimation (PE) is of vital importance for successful mission performance of agile autonomous robots. Global Positioning Systems such as GPS and GNSS have been typically used in fusion with Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) for PE. However, the low update rate and lack of proper signals make their utility impractical for indoor and urban applications. On the other hand, Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) is gaining popularity as a practical alternative for GNSS/INS systems in GPS-denied environments. Among the many VIO-based methods, the Multi-State Constraint Kalman Filter (MSCKF) has received a greater attention due to its robustness, speed and accuracy. To this end, the high computational cost associated with image processing for real-time implementation of MSCKF on resource-constrained vehicles is still a challenging ongoing research. In this paper, an enhanced version of the MSCKF is proposed. To this aim, different feature marginalization and state pruning strategies are suggested that result in a much faster algorithm. The proposed algorithm is tested both on an open-source dataset and in real-world experiments for validation. It is demonstrated that the proposed Fast-MSCKF (FMSCKF) is about six times faster and at least 20% more accurate in final position estimation than the standard MSCKF algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Robust and Efficient Visual-Inertial Initialization with Probabilistic Normal Epipolar Constraint](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19473v1)** | 2024-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and robust initialization is essential for Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO), as poor initialization can severely degrade pose accuracy. During initialization, it is crucial to estimate parameters such as accelerometer bias, gyroscope bias, initial velocity, and gravity, etc. The IMU sensor requires precise estimation of gyroscope bias because gyroscope bias affects rotation, velocity and position. Most existing VIO initialization methods adopt Structure from Motion (SfM) to solve for gyroscope bias. However, SfM is not stable and efficient enough in fast motion or degenerate scenes. To overcome these limitations, we extended the rotation-translation-decoupling framework by adding new uncertainty parameters and optimization modules. First, we adopt a gyroscope bias optimizer that incorporates probabilistic normal epipolar constraints. Second, we fuse IMU and visual measurements to solve for velocity, gravity, and scale efficiently. Finally, we design an additional refinement module that effectively diminishes gravity and scale errors. Extensive initialization tests on the EuRoC dataset show that our method reduces the gyroscope bias and rotation estimation error by an average of 16% and 4% respectively. It also significantly reduces the gravity error, with an average reduction of 29%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Flying through Moving Gates without Full State Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15799v2)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous drone racing requires powerful perception, planning, and control and has become a benchmark and test field for autonomous, agile flight. Existing work usually assumes static race tracks with known maps, which enables offline planning of time-optimal trajectories, performing localization to the gates to reduce the drift in visual-inertial odometry (VIO) for state estimation or training learning-based methods for the particular race track and operating environment. In contrast, many real-world tasks like disaster response or delivery need to be performed in unknown and dynamic environments. To close this gap and make drone racing more robust against unseen environments and moving gates, we propose a control algorithm that does not require a race track map or VIO and uses only monocular measurements of the line of sight (LOS) to the gates. For this purpose, we adopt the law of proportional navigation (PN) to accurately fly through the gates despite gate motions or wind. We formulate the PN-informed vision-based control problem for drone racing as a constrained optimization problem and derive a closed-form optimal solution. We demonstrate through extensive simulations and real-world experiments that our method can navigate through moving gates at high speeds while being robust to different gate movements, model errors, wind, and delays.</p></details> | 7 pages, 6 figures |

While deep learning-based (DL) methods excel at inferring semantic object information from images, such as class and relative 6 degree of freedom (6-DoF) pose, they are computationally demanding and thus often not suitable for payload constrained mobile robots. In this letter we present a real-time capable unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) system for object-relative, closed-loop navigation with a minimal sensor configuration consisting of an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and RGB camera. Utilizing a DL-based object pose estimator, solely trained on synthetic data and optimized for companion board deployment, the object-relative pose measurements are fused with the IMU data to perform object-relative localization. We conduct multiple real-world experiments to validate the performance of our system for the challenging use case of power pole inspection. An example closed-loop flight is presented in the supplementary video.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L), 2024</p></details> |
| **[Fast Extrinsic Calibration for Multiple Inertial Measurement Units in Visual-Inertial System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16228v1)** | 2024-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a fast extrinsic calibration method for fusing multiple inertial measurement units (MIMU) to improve visual-inertial odometry (VIO) localization accuracy. Currently, data fusion algorithms for MIMU highly depend on the number of inertial sensors. Based on the assumption that extrinsic parameters between inertial sensors are perfectly calibrated, the fusion algorithm provides better localization accuracy with more IMUs, while neglecting the effect of extrinsic calibration error. Our method builds two non-linear least-squares problems to estimate the MIMU relative position and orientation separately, independent of external sensors and inertial noises online estimation. Then we give the general form of the virtual IMU (VIMU) method and propose its propagation on manifold. We perform our method on datasets, our self-made sensor board, and board with different IMUs, validating the superiority of our method over competing methods concerning speed, accuracy, and robustness. In the simulation experiment, we show that only fusing two IMUs with our calibration method to predict motion can rival nine IMUs. Real-world experiments demonstrate better localization accuracy of the VIO integrated with our calibration method and VIMU propagation on manifold.</p></details> |  |

However, their deployment on resource-constrained devices is non-trivial since large network parameters should be accommodated in the device memory. Furthermore, these networks may risk failure post-deployment due to environmental distribution shifts at test time. In light of this, we propose UL-VIO -- an ultra-lightweight (<1M) VIO network capable of test-time adaptation (TTA) based on visual-inertial consistency. Specifically, we perform model compression to the network while preserving the low-level encoder part, including all BatchNorm parameters for resource-efficient test-time adaptation. It achieves 36X smaller network size than state-of-the-art with a minute increase in error -- 1% on the KITTI dataset. For test-time adaptation, we propose to use the inertia-referred network outputs as pseudo labels and update the BatchNorm parameter for lightweight yet effective adaptation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to perform noise-robust TTA on VIO. Experimental results on the KITTI, EuRoC, and Marulan datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our resource-efficient adaptation method under diverse TTA scenarios with dynamic domain shifts.</p></details> |  |

A sliding window of keyframes is optimized by minimizing re-projection errors, relative inertial errors, and relative magnetometer orientation errors. The results of IMU orientation propagation are used to efficiently transform magnetometer measurements between frames producing relative orientation constraints between consecutive frames. The soft and hard iron effects are calibrated using an ellipsoid fitting algorithm. The introduction of magnetometer data results in significant reductions in the orientation error and also in recovery of the true yaw orientation with respect to the magnetic north. The proposed framework operates in all environments with slow-varying magnetic fields, mainly outdoors and underwater. We have focused our work on the underwater domain, especially in underwater caves, as the narrow passage and turbulent flow make it difficult to perform loop closures and reset the localization drift. The underwater caves present challenges to VIO due to the absence of ambient light and the confined nature of the environment, while also being a crucial source of fresh water and providing valuable historical records. Experimental results from underwater caves demonstrate the improvements in accuracy and robustness introduced by the proposed VIO extension.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal Transformer for Fusion and Pose Estimation in Deep Visual Inertial Odometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08769v1)** | 2024-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, transformer-based architectures become the de facto standard for sequence modeling in deep learning frameworks. Inspired by the successful examples, we propose a causal visual-inertial fusion transformer (VIFT) for pose estimation in deep visual-inertial odometry. This study aims to improve pose estimation accuracy by leveraging the attention mechanisms in transformers, which better utilize historical data compared to the recurrent neural network (RNN) based methods seen in recent methods. Transformers typically require large-scale data for training. To address this issue, we utilize inductive biases for deep VIO networks. Since latent visual-inertial feature vectors encompass essential information for pose estimation, we employ transformers to refine pose estimates by updating latent vectors temporally. Our study also examines the impact of data imbalance and rotation learning methods in supervised end-to-end learning of visual inertial odometry by utilizing specialized gradients in backpropagation for the elements of SE$(3)$ group. The proposed method is end-to-end trainable and requires only a monocular camera and IMU during inference. Experimental results demonstrate that VIFT increases the accuracy of monocular VIO networks, achieving state-of-the-art results when compared to previous methods on the KITTI dataset. The code will be made available at https://github.com/ybkurt/VIFT.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ECCV 2024 2nd Workshop on Vision-Centric Autonomous Driving (VCAD)</p></details> |

These systems, including LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO) and Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO), often face challenges in localization due to adverse environmental conditions such as dust, smoke, and limited visual features. To address these limitations, we propose a novel head-mounted Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) dataset with ground truth, aimed at advancing data-driven IMU pose estimation. Our dataset captures human head motion patterns using a helmet-mounted system, with data from ten participants performing various activities. We explore the application of neural networks, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Transformer networks, to correct IMU biases and improve localization accuracy. Additionally, we evaluate the performance of these methods across different IMU data window dimensions, motion patterns, and sensor types. We release a publicly available dataset, demonstrate the feasibility of advanced neural network approaches for helmet-based localization, and provide evaluation metrics to establish a baseline for future studies in this field.

Unlike its predecessor, the Mars 2020 mission, which relied on a state estimation system assuming planar terrain, MSH requires a novel approach due to the complex topography of the landing site. This work introduces a novel range-visual-inertial odometry system tailored for the unique challenges of the MSH mission. Our system extends the state-of-the-art xVIO framework by fusing consistent range information with visual and inertial measurements, preventing metric scale drift in the absence of visual-inertial excitation (mono camera and constant velocity descent), and enabling landing on any terrain structure, without requiring any planar terrain assumption. Through extensive testing in image-based simulations using actual terrain structure and textures collected in Mars orbit, we demonstrate that our range-VIO approach estimates terrain-relative velocity meeting the stringent mission requirements, and outperforming existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE/...</summary><p>IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots (IROS), 2024</p></details> |

Also, both Visual Odometry (VO) and Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO) are susceptible to adverse weather conditions that causes occlusions or blur on the visual input. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for vehicle localization that uses street network based map information to correct drifting odometry estimates and intermittent GPS measurements especially, in adversarial scenarios such as driving in rain and tunnels. Specifically, our approach is a flexible fusion algorithm that integrates intermittent GPS, drifting IMU and VO estimates together with 2D map information for robust vehicle localization and tracking. We refer to our approach as Map-Fusion. We robustly evaluate our proposed approach on four geographically diverse datasets from different countries ranging across clear and rain weather conditions. These datasets also include challenging visual segments in tunnels and underpasses. We show that with the integration of the map information, our Map-Fusion algorithm reduces the error of the state-of-the-art VO and VIO approaches across all datasets. We also validate our proposed algorithm in a real-world environment and in real-time on a hardware constrained mobile robot. Map-Fusion achieved 2.46m error in clear weather and 6.05m error in rain weather for a 150m route.</p></details> |  |

LiDAR-based localization is accurate and robust to challenging environmental conditions, but 3D LiDARs are relatively heavy and require large UAV platforms, in contrast to lightweight cameras. However, visual-based self-localization methods exhibit lower accuracy and can suffer from significant drift with respect to the global reference frame. To benefit from both sensory modalities, we focus on cooperative navigation in a heterogeneous team of a primary LiDAR-equipped UAV and a secondary micro-scale camera-equipped UAV. We propose a novel cooperative approach combining LiDAR relative localization data with VIO output on board the primary UAV to obtain an accurate pose of the secondary UAV. The pose estimate is used to precisely and reliably guide the secondary UAV along trajectories defined in the primary UAV reference frame. The experimental evaluation has shown the superior accuracy of our method to the raw VIO output and demonstrated its capability to guide the secondary UAV along desired trajectories while mitigating VIO drift. Thus, such a heterogeneous system can explore large areas with LiDAR precision, as well as visit locations inaccessible to the large LiDAR-carrying UAV platforms, as was showcased in a real-world cooperative mapping scenario.</p></details> | <details><summary>pre-p...</summary><p>pre-print submitted to Journal of Intelligent and Robotic Systems</p></details> |

Planes are commonplace in man-made environments, offering an active means to reduce drift, due to their extensive spatial and temporal observability. To make full use of planar information, we propose a novel visual-inertial odometry (VIO) using an RGBD camera and an inertial measurement unit (IMU), effectively integrating point and plane features in an extended Kalman filter (EKF) framework. Depth information of point features is leveraged to improve the accuracy of point triangulation, while plane features serve as direct observations added into the state vector. Notably, to benefit long-term navigation,a novel graph-based drift detection strategy is proposed to search overlapping and identical structures in the plane map so that the cumulative drift is suppressed subsequently. The experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate that our system outperforms state-of-the-art methods in localization accuracy and meanwhile generates a compact and consistent plane map, free of expensive global bundle adjustment and loop closing techniques.</p></details> |  |

For a drone equipped with monocular camera and an UGV equipped with LiDAR as an external sensor, we propose a robust and real-time relative pose estimation method (LVCP) based on the tight coupling of vision and LiDAR point cloud information, which does not require prior information such as maps or precise initial poses. Given that large-scale point clouds generated by 3D sensors has more accurate spatial geometric information than the feature point cloud generated by image, we utilize LiDAR point clouds to correct the drift in visual-inertial odometry (VIO) when the camera undergoes significant shaking or the IMU has a low signal-to-noise ratio. To achieve this, we propose a novel coarse-to-fine framework for LiDAR-vision collaborative localization. In this framework, we construct point-plane association based on spatial geometric information, and innovatively construct a point-aided Bundle Adjustment (BA) problem as the backend to simultaneously estimate the relative pose of the camera and LiDAR and correct the VIO drift. In this process, we propose a particle swarm optimization (PSO) based sampling algorithm to complete the coarse estimation of the current camera-LiDAR pose. In this process, the initial pose of the camera used for sampling is obtained based on VIO propagation, and the valid feature-plane association number (VFPN) is used to trigger PSO-sampling process. Additionally, we propose a method that combines Structure from Motion (SFM) and multi-level sampling to initialize the algorithm, addressing the challenge of lacking initial values.</p></details> | <details><summary>See m...</summary><p>See more details in https://sites.google.com/view/lvcp</p></details> |

For parking scenarios, dynamic lighting, sparse textures, and the instability of global positioning system (GPS) signals pose challenges for most traditional localization methods. To address these difficulties, we propose VIPS-Odom, a novel semantic visual-inertial odometry framework for underground autonomous parking, which adopts tightly-coupled optimization to fuse measurements from multi-modal sensors and solves odometry. Our VIPS-Odom integrates parking slots detected from the synthesized bird-eye-view (BEV) image with traditional feature points in the frontend, and conducts tightly-coupled optimization with joint constraints introduced by measurements from the inertial measurement unit, wheel speed sensor and parking slots in the backend. We develop a multi-object tracking framework to robustly track parking slots' states. To prove the superiority of our method, we equip an electronic vehicle with related sensors and build an experimental platform based on ROS2 system. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy and advantages of our method compared with other baselines for parking scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>A SLA...</summary><p>A SLAM Method for Autonomous Parking</p></details> |

Though modern optimization-based algorithms have achieved superior accuracy, the MSCKF-based VIO algorithms are still widely demanded for their efficient and consistent performance. As MSCKF is built upon the conventional multi-view geometry, the measured residuals are not only related to the state errors but also related to the feature position errors. To apply EKF fusion, a projection process is required to remove the feature position error from the observation model, which can lead to model and accuracy degradation. To obtain an efficient visual-inertial fusion model, while also preserving the model consistency, we propose to reconstruct the MSCKF VIO with the novel Pose-Only (PO) multi-view geometry description. In the newly constructed filter, we have modeled PO reprojection residuals, which are solely related to the motion states and thus overcome the requirements of space projection. Moreover, the new filter does not require any feature position information, which removes the computational cost and linearization errors brought in by the 3D reconstruction procedure. We have conducted comprehensive experiments on multiple datasets, where the proposed method has shown accuracy improvements and consistent performance in challenging sequences.</p></details> |  |

A crucial subtask within VIO is the tracking of features, which can be achieved through Optical Flow (OF). As the calculation of OF is a resource-demanding task in terms of computational load and memory footprint, which needs to be executed at low latency, especially in robotic applications, OF estimation is today performed on powerful CPUs or GPUs. This restricts its use in a broad spectrum of applications where the deployment of such powerful, power-hungry processors is unfeasible due to constraints related to cost, size, and power consumption. On-sensor hardware acceleration is a promising approach to enable low latency VIO even on resource-constrained devices such as nano drones. This paper assesses the speed-up in a VIO sensor system exploiting a compact OF sensor consisting of a global shutter camera and an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC). By replacing the feature tracking logic of the VINS-Mono pipeline with data from this OF camera, we demonstrate a 49.4% reduction in latency and a 53.7% reduction of compute load of the VIO pipeline over the original VINS-Mono implementation, allowing VINS-Mono operation up to 50 FPS instead of 20 FPS on the quad-core ARM Cortex-A72 processor of a Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This article has been accepted for publication in the IEEE Sensors Journal (JSEN)</p></details> |

Thanks to a passive detachable mechanism, the interface can be attached/detached from a robot, offering two control modes: local control (attached) and teleoperation (detached). These modes are integrated with a robot whole-body controller and presented in a unified close- and far-proximity control framework for MCR. The earlier introduction of the haptic component in this interface enabled users to execute intricate loco-manipulation tasks via admittance-type control, effectively decoupling task dynamics and enhancing human capabilities. In contrast, this ongoing work proposes a novel design that integrates a visual component. This design utilizes Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) for teleoperation, estimating the interface's pose through stereo cameras and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). The estimated pose serves as the reference for the robot's end-effector in teleoperation mode. Hence, the interface offers complete flexibility and adaptability, enabling any user to operate an MCR seamlessly without needing expert knowledge. In this letter, we primarily focus on the new visual feature, and first present a performance evaluation of different VIO-based methods for teleoperation. Next, the interface's usability is analyzed in a home-care application and compared to an alternative designed by a commercial MoCap system. Results show comparable performance in terms of accuracy, completion time, and usability. Nevertheless, the proposed interface is low-cost, poses minimal wearability constraints, and can be used anywhere and anytime without needing external devices or additional equipment, offering a versatile and accessible solution for teleoperation.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present ST-VIO, a novel approach which tightly fuses a single-track dynamics model for wheeled ground vehicles with visual inertial odometry (VIO). Our method calibrates and adapts the dynamics model online to improve the accuracy of forward prediction conditioned on future control inputs. The single-track dynamics model approximates wheeled vehicle motion under specific control inputs on flat ground using ordinary differential equations. We use a singularity-free and differentiable variant of the single-track model to enable seamless integration as dynamics factor into VIO and to optimize the model parameters online together with the VIO state variables. We validate our method with real-world data in both indoor and outdoor environments with different terrain types and wheels. In experiments, we demonstrate that ST-VIO can not only adapt to wheel or ground changes and improve the accuracy of prediction under new control inputs, but can even improve tracking accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), 2024</p></details> |
| **[Adaptive VIO: Deep Visual-Inertial Odometry with Online Continual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16754v1)** | 2024-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual-inertial odometry (VIO) has demonstrated remarkable success due to its low-cost and complementary sensors. However, existing VIO methods lack the generalization ability to adjust to different environments and sensor attributes. In this paper, we propose Adaptive VIO, a new monocular visual-inertial odometry that combines online continual learning with traditional nonlinear optimization. Adaptive VIO comprises two networks to predict visual correspondence and IMU bias. Unlike end-to-end approaches that use networks to fuse the features from two modalities (camera and IMU) and predict poses directly, we combine neural networks with visual-inertial bundle adjustment in our VIO system. The optimized estimates will be fed back to the visual and IMU bias networks, refining the networks in a self-supervised manner. Such a learning-optimization-combined framework and feedback mechanism enable the system to perform online continual learning. Experiments demonstrate that our Adaptive VIO manifests adaptive capability on EuRoC and TUM-VI datasets. The overall performance exceeds the currently known learning-based VIO methods and is comparable to the state-of-the-art optimization-based methods.</p></details> |  |

Although in recent years, many works have been focusing on improving one of the most widely adopted state estimation methods, visual inertial odometry (VIO), by incorporating multiple cameras, these efforts predominantly address synchronous camera systems. Asynchronous cameras, which offer simpler hardware configurations and enhanced resilience, have been largely overlooked. To fill this gap, this paper presents VINS-Multi, a novel multi-camera-IMU state estimator for asynchronous cameras. The estimator comprises parallel front ends, a front end coordinator, and a back end optimization module capable of handling asynchronous input frames. It utilizes the frames effectively through a dynamic feature number allocation and a frame priority coordination strategy. The proposed estimator is integrated into a customized quadrotor platform and tested in multiple realistic and challenging scenarios to validate its practicality. Additionally, comprehensive benchmark results are provided to showcase the robustness and superior performance of the proposed estimator.</p></details> |  |

However, its performance under varying network setups, especially when combined with IMU data for real-time localization, has not been fully explored so far. In this study, we develop an error state Kalman filter (ESKF) and a pose graph optimization (PGO) approach to address this gap. We systematically evaluate the performance of the derived approaches for real-time MAV localization in realistic scenarios with 5G base stations in Line-Of-Sight (LOS), demonstrating the potential of 5G technologies in this domain. In order to experimentally test and compare our localization approaches, we augment the EuRoC MAV benchmark dataset for visual-inertial odometry with simulated yet highly realistic 5G ToA measurements. Our experimental results comprehensively assess the impact of varying network setups, including varying base station numbers and network configurations, on ToA-based MAV localization performance. The findings show promising results for seamless and robust localization using 5G ToA measurements, achieving an accuracy of 15 cm throughout the entire trajectory within a graph-based framework with five 5G base stations, and an accuracy of up to 34 cm in the case of ESKF-based localization. Additionally, we measure the run time of both algorithms and show that they are both fast enough for real-time implementation.</p></details> |  |

In this paper we approximate distributions at different points in the group in a single set of exponential coordinates and then use classical Gaussian fusion to obtain the fused posteriori in those coordinates. We consider several approximations including the exact Jacobian of the change of coordinate map, first and second order Taylor's expansions of the Jacobian, and parallel transport with and without curvature correction associated with the underlying geometry of the Lie group. Preliminary results on SO(3) demonstrate that a novel approximation using parallel transport with curvature correction achieves similar accuracy to the state-of-the-art optimisation based algorithms at a fraction of the computational cost.</p></details> | Preprint for L-CSS |

It combines visual and inertial measurements to accurately estimate position and orientation. Existing VIO methods assume a fixed noise covariance for the inertial uncertainty. However, accurately determining in real-time the noise variance of the inertial sensors presents a significant challenge as the uncertainty changes throughout the operation leading to suboptimal performance and reduced accuracy. To circumvent this, we propose VIO-DualProNet, a novel approach that utilizes deep learning methods to dynamically estimate the inertial noise uncertainty in real-time. By designing and training a deep neural network to predict inertial noise uncertainty using only inertial sensor measurements, and integrating it into the VINS-Mono algorithm, we demonstrate a substantial improvement in accuracy and robustness, enhancing VIO performance and potentially benefiting other VIO-based systems for precise localization and mapping across diverse conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 15 figures, bib file</p></details> |

Absolute Pose Regressors (APR) are end-to-end machine learning solutions that infer the device's pose from a single monocular image. Thanks to their low computation cost, they can be directly executed on the constrained hardware of mobile AR devices. However, APR methods tend to yield significant inaccuracies for input images that are too distant from the training set. This paper introduces KS-APR, a pipeline that assesses the reliability of an estimated pose with minimal overhead by combining the inference results of the APR and the prior images in the training set. Mobile AR systems tend to rely upon visual-inertial odometry to track the relative pose of the device during the experience. As such, KS-APR favours reliability over frequency, discarding unreliable poses. This pipeline can integrate most existing APR methods to improve accuracy by filtering unreliable images with their pose estimates. We implement the pipeline on three types of APR models on indoor and outdoor datasets. The median error on position and orientation is reduced for all models, and the proportion of large errors is minimized across datasets. Our method enables state-of-the-art APRs such as DFNetdm to outperform single-image and sequential APR methods. These results demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of KS-APR for visual localization tasks that do not require one-shot decisions.</p></details> |  |

Poor outcomes and pain after knee replacement surgery are often linked to patellar mal-tracking. Traditional imaging methods like CT and MRI face challenges, including cost and metal artefacts, and there's currently no ideal way to observe joint motion without issues such as soft tissue artefacts or radiation exposure. A new system to monitor joint motion could significantly improve understanding of PFJ dynamics, aiding in better patient care and outcomes. Combining 2D ultrasound with motion tracking for 3D reconstruction of the joint using semantic segmentation and position registration can be a solution. However, the need for expensive external infrastructure to estimate the trajectories of the scanner remains the main limitation to implementing 3D bone reconstruction from handheld ultrasound scanning clinically. We proposed the Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) and the deep learning-based inertial-only odometry methods as alternatives to motion capture for tracking a handheld ultrasound scanner. The 3D reconstruction generated by these methods has demonstrated potential for assessing the PFJ and for further measurements from free-hand ultrasound scans. The results show that the VIO method performs as well as the motion capture method, with average reconstruction errors of 1.25 mm and 1.21 mm, respectively. The VIO method is the first infrastructure-free method for 3D reconstruction of bone from wireless handheld ultrasound scanning with an accuracy comparable to methods that require external infrastructure.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Medical Measurements & Applications (MeMeA) 2024</p></details> |

Despite their advancements, these methods often encounter dead-reckoning errors that leads to considerable drift in estimated platform motion especially during long traverses. In such cases, the drift error is not negligible and should be rectified. Our proposed approach minimizes the drift error by correcting the estimated motion generated by any SLAM method at each epoch. Our methodology treats positioning measurements rendered by the SLAM solution as random variables formulated jointly in a multivariate distribution. In this setting, The correction of the drift becomes equivalent to finding the mode of this multivariate distribution which jointly maximizes the likelihood of a set of relevant geo-spatial priors about the platform motion and environment. Our method is integrable into any SLAM/VIO method as an correction module. Our experimental results shows the effectiveness of our approach in minimizing the drift error by 10x in long treverses.</p></details> |  |

Such temporal misalignment introduces inconsistent constraints for state estimation, leading to a significant positioning drift especially in high dynamic motion scenarios. In this article, we focus on online temporal calibration to reduce the positioning drift caused by the time offset for high dynamic motion VIO. For the time offset observation model, most existing methods rely on accurate state estimation or stable visual tracking. For the prediction model, current methods oversimplify the time offset as a constant value with white Gaussian noise. However, these ideal conditions are seldom satisfied in real high dynamic scenarios, resulting in the poor performance. In this paper, we introduce online time offset modeling networks (TON) to enhance real-time temporal calibration. TON improves the accuracy of time offset observation and prediction modeling. Specifically, for observation modeling, we propose feature velocity observation networks to enhance velocity computation for features in unstable visual tracking conditions. For prediction modeling, we present time offset prediction networks to learn its evolution pattern. To highlight the effectiveness of our method, we integrate the proposed TON into both optimization-based and filter-based VIO systems. Simulation and real-world experiments are conducted to demonstrate the enhanced performance of our approach. Additionally, to contribute to the VIO community, we will open-source the code of our method on: https://github.com/Franky-X/FVON-TPN.</p></details> |  |

The proposed HDA_LVIO system can be divided into two subsystems: the LiDAR-Inertial subsystem (LIS) and the Visual-Inertial subsystem (VIS). In the LIS, the LiDAR pointcloud is utilized to calculate the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) error, serving as the measurement value of Error State Iterated Kalman Filter (ESIKF) to construct the global map. In the VIS, an incremental method is firstly employed to adaptively extract planes from the global map. And the centroids of these planes are projected onto the image to obtain projection points. Then, feature points are extracted from the image and tracked along with projection points using Lucas-Kanade (LK) optical flow. Next, leveraging the vehicle states from previous intervals, sliding window optimization is performed to estimate the depth of feature points. Concurrently, a method based on epipolar geometric constraints is proposed to address tracking failures for feature points, which can improve the accuracy of depth estimation for feature points by ensuring sufficient parallax within the sliding window. Subsequently, the feature points and projection points are hybridly associated to construct reprojection error, serving as the measurement value of ESIKF to estimate vehicle states. Finally, the localization accuracy of the proposed HDA-LVIO is validated using public datasets and data from our equipment. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves obviously improvement in localization accuracy compared to various existing algorithms.</p></details> |  |

Our proposed pipeline achieves temporal tracking and instantaneous matching between consecutive stereo event streams, thereby obtaining robust state estimation. In addition, the motion compensation method is designed to emphasize the edge of scenes by warping each event to reference moments with IMU and ESVIO back-end. We validate that both ESIO (purely event-based) and ESVIO (event with image-aided) have superior performance compared with other image-based and event-based baseline methods on public and self-collected datasets. Furthermore, we use our pipeline to perform onboard quadrotor flights under low-light environments. A real-world large-scale experiment is also conducted to demonstrate long-term effectiveness.

In this work, we design a novel visual-inertial odometry (VIO) system called RD-VIO to handle both of these two problems. Firstly, we propose an IMU-PARSAC algorithm which can robustly detect and match keypoints in a two-stage process. In the first state, landmarks are matched with new keypoints using visual and IMU measurements. We collect statistical information from the matching and then guide the intra-keypoint matching in the second stage. Secondly, to handle the problem of pure rotation, we detect the motion type and adapt the deferred-triangulation technique during the data-association process. We make the pure-rotational frames into the special subframes. When solving the visual-inertial bundle adjustment, they provide additional constraints to the pure-rotational motion.

As such, AR systems rely on visual-inertial odometry (VIO) to track the device's relative pose between requests to the server. However, VIO suffers from drift, requiring frequent absolute repositioning. This paper introduces MobileARLoc, a new framework for on-device large-scale markerless mobile AR that combines an absolute pose regressor (APR) with a local VIO tracking system. Absolute pose regressors (APRs) provide fast on-device pose estimation at the cost of reduced accuracy. To address APR accuracy and reduce VIO drift, MobileARLoc creates a feedback loop where VIO pose estimations refine the APR predictions. The VIO system identifies reliable predictions of APR, which are then used to compensate for the VIO drift. We comprehensively evaluate MobileARLoc through dataset simulations. MobileARLoc halves the error compared to the underlying APR and achieve fast (80\,ms) on-device inference speed.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the 3rd edition of the Pervasive and Resource-Constrained AI (PerConAI) workshop (co-located with PerCom 2024).

| **[SemanticSLAM: Learning based Semantic Map Construction and Robust Camera Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13076v1)** | 2024-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current techniques in Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (VSLAM) estimate camera displacement by comparing image features of consecutive scenes. These algorithms depend on scene continuity, hence requires frequent camera inputs. However, processing images frequently can lead to significant memory usage and computation overhead. In this study, we introduce SemanticSLAM, an end-to-end visual-inertial odometry system that utilizes semantic features extracted from an RGB-D sensor. This approach enables the creation of a semantic map of the environment and ensures reliable camera localization. SemanticSLAM is scene-agnostic, which means it doesn't require retraining for different environments. It operates effectively in indoor settings, even with infrequent camera input, without prior knowledge. The strength of SemanticSLAM lies in its ability to gradually refine the semantic map and improve pose estimation. This is achieved by a convolutional long-short-term-memory (ConvLSTM) network, trained to correct errors during map construction. Compared to existing VSLAM algorithms, SemanticSLAM improves pose estimation by 17%. The resulting semantic map provides interpretable information about the environment and can be easily applied to various downstream tasks, such as path planning, obstacle avoidance, and robot navigation. The code will be publicly available at https://github.com/Leomingyangli/SemanticSLAM</p></details> | <details><summary>2023 ...</summary><p>2023 IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence (SSCI) 6 pages</p></details> |
| **[Tight Fusion of Events and Inertial Measurements for Direct Velocity Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09296v1)** | 2024-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional visual-inertial state estimation targets absolute camera poses and spatial landmark locations while first-order kinematics are typically resolved as an implicitly estimated sub-state. However, this poses a risk in velocity-based control scenarios, as the quality of the estimation of kinematics depends on the stability of absolute camera and landmark coordinates estimation. To address this issue, we propose a novel solution to tight visual-inertial fusion directly at the level of first-order kinematics by employing a dynamic vision sensor instead of a normal camera. More specifically, we leverage trifocal tensor geometry to establish an incidence relation that directly depends on events and camera velocity, and demonstrate how velocity estimates in highly dynamic situations can be obtained over short time intervals. Noise and outliers are dealt with using a nested two-layer RANSAC scheme. Additionally, smooth velocity signals are obtained from a tight fusion with pre-integrated inertial signals using a sliding window optimizer. Experiments on both simulated and real data demonstrate that the proposed tight event-inertial fusion leads to continuous and reliable velocity estimation in highly dynamic scenarios independently of absolute coordinates. Furthermore, in extreme cases, it achieves more stable and more accurate estimation of kinematics than traditional, point-position-based visual-inertial odometry.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Robotics (T-RO)</p></details> |

The applications of VIO span a diverse range, including augmented reality and indoor navigation. VIO algorithms hold the potential to facilitate navigation for visually impaired individuals in both indoor and outdoor settings. Nevertheless, state-of-the-art VIO algorithms encounter substantial challenges in dynamic environments, particularly in densely populated corridors. Existing VIO datasets, e.g., ADVIO, typically fail to effectively exploit these challenges. In this paper, we introduce the Amirkabir campus dataset (AUT-VI) to address the mentioned problem and improve the navigation systems. AUT-VI is a novel and super-challenging dataset with 126 diverse sequences in 17 different locations. This dataset contains dynamic objects, challenging loop-closure/map-reuse, different lighting conditions, reflections, and sudden camera movements to cover all extreme navigation scenarios. Moreover, in support of ongoing development efforts, we have released the Android application for data capture to the public. This allows fellow researchers to easily capture their customized VIO dataset variations. In addition, we evaluate state-of-the-art Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO) and Visual Odometry (VO) methods on our dataset, emphasizing the essential need for this challenging dataset.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |

The novel EKF-based method estimates the positional and rotational offsets of the system of sensors as well as their intrinsic biases without the use of rigid body geometric constraints. Additionally, the filter is flexible in the total number of sensors used while leveraging the commonly used MSCKF framework for camera measurements. The filter framework has been validated using Monte Carlo simulation as well as experimentally. In both simulations and experiments, using multiple IMU measurement streams within the proposed filter framework outperforms the use of a single IMU in a filter prediction step while also producing consistent and accurate estimates of initial calibration errors. Compared to current state-of-the-art optimizers, the filter produces similar intrinsic and extrinsic calibration parameters for each sensor. Finally, an open source repository has been provided at https://github.com/unmannedlab/ekf-cal containing both the online estimator and the simulation used for testing and evaluation.</p></details> |  |

We use two fixed-lag smoothers (FLS) to decouple accurate state estimation and high-rate pose generation for closed-loop control. The first FLS combines ultrawideband (UWB)-based range measurements and VIO to estimate the robot trajectory and any systematic biases that affect the range measurements in cluttered environments. The second FLS estimates smooth corrections to VIO to generate pose estimates at a high rate for online control. The proposed method is lightweight and can run on a computationally constrained micro-aerial vehicle (MAV). We validate our approach through closed-loop flight tests involving dynamic trajectories in multiple real-world cluttered indoor environments. Our method achieves decimeter-to-sub-decimeter-level positioning accuracy using off-the-shelf sensors and decimeter-level tracking accuracy with minimally-tuned open-source controllers.</p></details> |  |

However, the accuracy of VIO is often compromised by photometric changes, weak textures and motion blur, unlike the more robust LIO. This paper introduces SR-LIVO, an advanced and novel LIV-SLAM system employing sweep reconstruction to align reconstructed sweeps with image timestamps. This allows the LIO module to accurately determine states at all imaging moments, enhancing pose accuracy and processing efficiency. Experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate that: 1) our SRLIVO outperforms existing state-of-the-art LIV-SLAM systems in both pose accuracy and time efficiency; 2) our LIO-based pose estimation prove more accurate than VIO-based ones in several mainstream LIV-SLAM systems (including ours). We have released our source code to contribute to the community development in this field.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 6 figures, submitted to IEEE RA-L</p></details> |

We define a symmetry group and corresponding group action that allow specifically the design of an equivariant filter for the problem of visual-inertial odometry (VIO) including IMU bias, and camera intrinsic and extrinsic calibration states. In contrast to state-of-the-art invariant extended Kalman filter (IEKF) approaches that simply tack IMU bias and other states onto the $\mathbf{SE}_2(3)$ group, our filter builds upon a symmetry that properly includes all the states in the group structure. Thus, we achieve improved behavior, particularly when linearization points largely deviate from the truth (i.e., on transients upon state disturbances). Our approach is inherently consistent even during convergence phases from significant errors without the need for error uncertainty adaptation, observability constraint, or other consistency enforcing techniques. This leads to greatly improved estimator behavior for significant error and unexpected state changes during, e.g., long-duration missions. We evaluate our approach with a multitude of different experiments using three different prominent real-world datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L), 2023</p></details> |
| **[Homography Initialization and Dynamic Weighting Algorithm Based on a Downward-Looking Camera and IMU](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09622v1)** | 2023-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the technology in visual-inertial odometry (VIO) has matured considerably and has been widely used in many applications. However, we still encounter challenges when applying VIO to a micro air vehicle (MAV) equipped with a downward-looking camera. Specifically, VIO cannot compute the correct initialization results during take-off and the cumulative drift is large when the MAV is flying in the air. To overcome these problems, we propose a homographybased initialization method, which utilizes the fact that the features detected by the downward-looking camera during take-off are approximately on the same plane. Then we introduce the prior normal vector and motion field to make states more accurate. In addition, to deal with the cumulative drift, a strategy for dynamically weighting visual residuals is proposed. Finally, we evaluate our method on the collected real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that our system can be successfully initialized no matter how the MAV takes off and the positioning errors are also greatly improved.</p></details> |  |

In most human-built scenes often with low features, lines can be considered complements to points. In this paper, we present a multi-robot cooperative visual-inertial navigation system (VINS) using both point and line features. By utilizing the covariance intersection (CI) update within the multi-state constraint Kalman filter (MSCKF) framework, each robot exploits not only its own point and line measurements, but also constraints of common point and common line features observed by its neighbors. The line features are parameterized and updated by utilizing the Closest Point representation. The proposed algorithm is validated extensively in both Monte-Carlo simulations and a real-world dataset. The results show that the point-line cooperative visual-inertial odometry (PL-CVIO) outperforms the independent MSCKF and our previous work CVIO in both low-feature and rich-feature environments.</p></details> |  |

Conventional EKF-based VIO usually suffers from system inconsistency and angular drift that naturally occurs in feature-based methods. However, in man-made environments, notable structural regularities, such as lines and vanishing points, offer valuable cues for localization. To exploit these structural features effectively and maintain system consistency, we design a right invariant filter-based VIO scheme incorporating point, line, and vanishing point features. We demonstrate that the conventional additive error definition for point features can also preserve system consistency like the invariant error definition by proving a mathematically equivalent measurement model. And a similar conclusion is established for line features. Additionally, we conduct an invariant filter-based observability analysis proving that vanishing point measurement maintains unobservable directions naturally. Both simulation and real-world tests are conducted to validate our methods' pose accuracy and consistency. The experimental results validate the competitive performance of our method, highlighting its ability to deliver accurate and consistent pose estimation in man-made environments.</p></details> | ROBIO 2023 |
| **[Inertial Guided Uncertainty Estimation of Feature Correspondence in Visual-Inertial Odometry/SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03722v1)** | 2023-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual odometry and Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) has been studied as one of the most important tasks in the areas of computer vision and robotics, to contribute to autonomous navigation and augmented reality systems. In case of feature-based odometry/SLAM, a moving visual sensor observes a set of 3D points from different viewpoints, correspondences between the projected 2D points in each image are usually established by feature tracking and matching. However, since the corresponding point could be erroneous and noisy, reliable uncertainty estimation can improve the accuracy of odometry/SLAM methods. In addition, inertial measurement unit is utilized to aid the visual sensor in terms of Visual-Inertial fusion. In this paper, we propose a method to estimate the uncertainty of feature correspondence using an inertial guidance robust to image degradation caused by motion blur, illumination change and occlusion. Modeling a guidance distribution to sample possible correspondence, we fit the distribution to an energy function based on image error, yielding more robust uncertainty than conventional methods. We also demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by incorporating it into one of recent visual-inertial odometry/SLAM algorithms for public datasets.</p></details> | 12 pages |

The model is self-calibrating in real-time and is free of known correspondences or calibration targets. It is separable as a distortion model (dependent on refractive index $n$ and radial pixel coordinate) and a virtual pinhole model (as a function of $n$). We derive the self-calibration formulation leveraging epipolar constraints to estimate the refractive index and subsequently correct for distortion. Through experimental studies using an underwater robot integrating cameras and inertial sensing, the model is validated regarding the accurate estimation of the refractive index and its benefits for robust odometry estimation in an extended envelope of conditions. Lastly, we show the transition between media and the estimation of the varying refractive index online, thus allowing computer vision tasks across refractive media.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 6 figures, Submitted to the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, 2024</p></details> |

Current methods either rely heavily on GNSS, face limitations in visual-based localization due to appearance variances and stylistic dissimilarities between camera and reference imagery, or operate under the assumption of a known initial pose. In this paper, we developed a GNSS-denied localization approach for UAVs that harnesses both Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) and Visual Place Recognition (VPR) using a foundation model. This paper presents a novel vision-based pipeline that works exclusively with a nadir-facing camera, an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), and pre-existing satellite imagery for robust, accurate localization in varied environments and conditions. Our system demonstrated average localization accuracy within a $20$-meter range, with a minimum error below $1$ meter, under real-world conditions marked by drastic changes in environmental appearance and with no assumption of the vehicle's initial pose. The method is proven to be effective and robust, addressing the crucial need for reliable UAV localization in GNSS-denied environments, while also being computationally efficient enough to be deployed on resource-constrained platforms.</p></details> |  |
| **[LF-VISLAM: A SLAM Framework for Large Field-of-View Cameras with Negative Imaging Plane on Mobile Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05167v3)** | 2023-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) has become a crucial aspect in the fields of autonomous driving and robotics. One crucial component of visual SLAM is the Field-of-View (FoV) of the camera, as a larger FoV allows for a wider range of surrounding elements and features to be perceived. However, when the FoV of the camera reaches the negative half-plane, traditional methods for representing image feature points using [u,v,1]^T become ineffective. While the panoramic FoV is advantageous for loop closure, its benefits are not easily realized under large-attitude-angle differences where loop-closure frames cannot be easily matched by existing methods. As loop closure on wide-FoV panoramic data further comes with a large number of outliers, traditional outlier rejection methods are not directly applicable. To address these issues, we propose LF-VISLAM, a Visual Inertial SLAM framework for cameras with extremely Large FoV with loop closure. A three-dimensional vector with unit length is introduced to effectively represent feature points even on the negative half-plane. The attitude information of the SLAM system is leveraged to guide the feature point detection of the loop closure. Additionally, a new outlier rejection method based on the unit length representation is integrated into the loop closure module. We collect the PALVIO dataset using a Panoramic Annular Lens (PAL) system with an entire FoV of 360{\deg}x(40{\deg}~120{\deg}) and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) for Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO) to address the lack of panoramic SLAM datasets. Experiments on the established PALVIO and public datasets show that the proposed LF-VISLAM outperforms state-of-the-art SLAM methods.

Compared with the standard cameras, it can provide reliable visual perception during high-speed motions and in high dynamic range scenarios. However, event cameras output only a little information or even noise when the relative motion between the camera and the scene is limited, such as in a still state. While standard cameras can provide rich perception information in most scenarios, especially in good lighting conditions. These two cameras are exactly complementary. In this paper, we proposed a robust, high-accurate, and real-time optimization-based monocular event-based visual-inertial odometry (VIO) method with event-corner features, line-based event features, and point-based image features. The proposed method offers to leverage the point-based features in the nature scene and line-based features in the human-made scene to provide more additional structure or constraints information through well-design feature management. Experiments in the public benchmark datasets show that our method can achieve superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art image-based or event-based VIO. Finally, we used our method to demonstrate an onboard closed-loop autonomous quadrotor flight and large-scale outdoor experiments.

| **[Robust Localization with Visual-Inertial Odometry Constraints for Markerless Mobile AR](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05394v2)** | 2023-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO) is an essential component of modern Augmented Reality (AR) applications. However, VIO only tracks the relative pose of the device, leading to drift over time. Absolute pose estimation methods infer the device's absolute pose, but their accuracy depends on the input quality. This paper introduces VIO-APR, a new framework for markerless mobile AR that combines an absolute pose regressor (APR) with a local VIO tracking system. VIO-APR uses VIO to assess the reliability of the APR and the APR to identify and compensate for VIO drift. This feedback loop results in more accurate positioning and more stable AR experiences. To evaluate VIO-APR, we created a dataset that combines camera images with ARKit's VIO system output for six indoor and outdoor scenes of various scales. Over this dataset, VIO-APR improves the median accuracy of popular APR by up to 36\% in position and 29\% in orientation, increases the percentage of frames in the high ($0.25 m, 2^{\circ}$) accuracy level by up to 112\% and reduces the percentage of frames predicted below the low ($5 m, 10^\circ$) accuracy greatly. We implement VIO-APR into a mobile AR application using Unity to demonstrate its capabilities. VIO-APR results in noticeably more accurate localization and a more stable overall experience.</p></details> |  |

We propose a sparse point aided multi-view stereo neural network (SPA-MVSNet) that can effectively leverage the informative but noisy sparse points from the VIO system. The sparse depth from VIO is firstly completed by a single-view depth completion network. This dense depth map, although naturally limited in accuracy, is then used as a prior to guide our MVS network in the cost volume generation and regularization for accurate dense depth prediction. Predicted depth maps of keyframe images by the MVS network are incrementally fused into a global map using TSDF-Fusion. We extensively evaluate both the proposed SPA-MVSNet and the entire visual-inertial dense mapping system on several public datasets as well as our own dataset, demonstrating the system's impressive generalization capabilities and its ability to deliver high-quality 3D mesh reconstruction online. Our proposed dense mapping system achieves a 39.7% improvement in F-score over existing systems when evaluated on the challenging scenarios of the EuRoC dataset.</p></details> |  |

As individual sensor modalities cannot satisfy the strict requirements of robustness and safety, a combination thereof is required. We propose a path-constrained sensor fusion framework to integrate various modalities while leveraging the unique characteristics of the railway network. To reflect the constrained motion of rail vehicles along their tracks, the state is modeled in 1D along the track geometry. We further leverage the limited action space of a train by employing a novel multi-hypothesis tracking to account for multiple possible trajectories a vehicle can take through the railway network. We demonstrate the reliability and accuracy of our fusion framework on multiple tram datasets recorded in the city of Zurich, utilizing Visual-Inertial Odometry for local motion estimation and a standard GNSS for global localization. We evaluate our results using ground truth localizations recorded with a RTK-GNSS, and compare our method to standard baselines. A Root Mean Square Error of 4.78 m and a track selectivity score of up to 94.9 % have been achieved.</p></details> |  |

To enable such comprehension, 3D scene graphs have emerged as a robust tool for representing the environment as a layered graph of concepts and their relationships. However, building these representations using monocular vision systems in real-time remains a difficult task that has not been explored in depth. This paper puts forth a real-time spatial perception system Mono-Hydra, combining a monocular camera and an IMU sensor setup, focusing on indoor scenarios. However, the proposed approach is adaptable to outdoor applications, offering flexibility in its potential uses. The system employs a suite of deep learning algorithms to derive depth and semantics. It uses a robocentric visual-inertial odometry (VIO) algorithm based on square-root information, thereby ensuring consistent visual odometry with an IMU and a monocular camera. This system achieves sub-20 cm error in real-time processing at 15 fps, enabling real-time 3D scene graph construction using a laptop GPU (NVIDIA 3080).

In order to include range measurements in state estimation, the position of the UWB anchors must be known. This study proposes a multi-step initialization procedure to map multiple unknown anchors by an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), in a fully autonomous fashion. To address the limitations of initializing UWB anchors via a random trajectory, this paper uses the Geometric Dilution of Precision (GDOP) as a measure of optimality in anchor position estimation, to compute a set of optimal waypoints and synthesize a trajectory that minimizes the mapping uncertainty. After the initialization is complete, the range measurements from multiple anchors, including measurement biases, are tightly integrated into the VIO system. While in range of the initialized anchors, the VIO drift in position and heading is eliminated. The effectiveness of UVIO and our initialization procedure has been validated through a series of simulations and real-world experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stereo Event-based Visual-Inertial Odometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05086v4)** | 2023-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event-based cameras are new type vision sensors whose pixels work independently and respond asynchronously to brightness change with microsecond resolution, instead of providing standard intensity frames. Compared with traditional cameras, event-based cameras have low latency, no motion blur, and high dynamic range (HDR), which provide possibilities for robots to deal with some challenging scenes. We propose a visual-inertial odometry for stereo event-based cameras based on Error-State Kalman Filter (ESKF). The visual module updates the pose relies on the edge alignment of a semi-dense 3D map to a 2D image, and the IMU module updates pose by median integral. We evaluate our method on public datasets with general 6-DoF motion and compare the results against ground truth. We show that our proposed pipeline provides improved accuracy over the result of the state-of-the-art visual odometry for stereo event-based cameras, while running in real-time on a standard CPU (low-resolution cameras).

The guides coordinate to shape the workers like smart particles by changing their interaction parameters. We study the approach with a large scale experiment in a physics based simulator with up to 5000 robots forming three different patterns. Our experiments reveal that the approach scales well with increasing robot numbers, and presents little pattern distortion. We evaluate the approach on a physical swarm of robots that use visual inertial odometry to compute their relative positions and obtain results that are comparable with simulation. This work lays the foundation for designing and coordinating configurable smart particles, with applications in smart materials and nanomedicine.</p></details> | 7 pages, 9 figures |
| **[HDVIO: Improving Localization and Disturbance Estimation with Hybrid Dynamics VIO](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11429v2)** | 2023-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual-inertial odometry (VIO) is the most common approach for estimating the state of autonomous micro aerial vehicles using only onboard sensors. Existing methods improve VIO performance by including a dynamics model in the estimation pipeline. However, such methods degrade in the presence of low-fidelity vehicle models and continuous external disturbances, such as wind. Our proposed method, HDVIO, overcomes these limitations by using a hybrid dynamics model that combines a point-mass vehicle model with a learning-based component that captures complex aerodynamic effects. HDVIO estimates the external force and the full robot state by leveraging the discrepancy between the actual motion and the predicted motion of the hybrid dynamics model. Our hybrid dynamics model uses a history of thrust and IMU measurements to predict the vehicle dynamics. To demonstrate the performance of our method, we present results on both public and novel drone dynamics datasets and show real-world experiments of a quadrotor flying in strong winds up to 25 km/h. The results show that our approach improves the motion and external force estimation compared to the state-of-the-art by up to 33% and 40%, respectively. Furthermore, differently from existing methods, we show that it is possible to predict the vehicle dynamics accurately while having no explicit knowledge of its full state.</p></details> |  |

However, it has been meeting challenges in vehicular scenarios due to limited dynamics and lack of stable features. In this paper, we propose Ground-VIO, which utilizes ground features and the specific camera-ground geometry to enhance monocular VIO performance in realistic road environments. In the method, the camera-ground geometry is modeled with vehicle-centered parameters and integrated into an optimization-based VIO framework. These parameters could be calibrated online and simultaneously improve the odometry accuracy by providing stable scale-awareness. Besides, a specially designed visual front-end is developed to stably extract and track ground features via the inverse perspective mapping (IPM) technique. Both simulation tests and real-world experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that our implementation could dramatically improve monocular VIO accuracy in vehicular scenarios, achieving comparable or even better performance than state-of-art stereo VIO solutions. The system could also be used for the auto-calibration of IPM which is widely used in vehicle perception. A toolkit for ground feature processing, together with the experimental datasets, would be made open-source (https://github.com/GREAT-WHU/gv_tools).</p></details> |  |
| **[PVI-DSO: Leveraging Planar Regularities for Direct Sparse Visual-Inertial Odometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02635v2)** | 2023-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The monocular visual-inertial odometry (VIO) based on the direct method can leverage all available pixels in the image to simultaneously estimate the camera motion and reconstruct the denser map of the scene in real time. However, the direct method is sensitive to photometric changes, which can be compensated by introducing geometric information in the environment. In this paper, we propose a monocular direct sparse visual-inertial odometry, which exploits the planar regularities (PVI-DSO). Our system detects the planar regularities from the 3D mesh built on the estimated map points. To improve the pose estimation accuracy with the geometric information, a tightly coupled coplanar constraint expression is used to express photometric error in the direct method. Additionally, to improve the optimization efficiency, we elaborately derive the analytical Jacobian of the linearization form for the coplanar constraint. Finally, the inertial measurement error, coplanar point photometric error, non-coplanar photometric error, and prior error are added into the optimizer, which simultaneously improves the pose estimation accuracy and mesh itself. We verified the performance of the whole system on simulation and real-world datasets. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our system outperforms the state-of-the-art counterparts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Active Collaborative Localization in Heterogeneous Robot Teams](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18193v1)** | 2023-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and robust state estimation is critical for autonomous navigation of robot teams. This task is especially challenging for large groups of size, weight, and power (SWAP) constrained aerial robots operating in perceptually-degraded GPS-denied environments. We can, however, actively increase the amount of perceptual information available to such robots by augmenting them with a small number of more expensive, but less resource-constrained, agents. Specifically, the latter can serve as sources of perceptual information themselves. In this paper, we study the problem of optimally positioning (and potentially navigating) a small number of more capable agents to enhance the perceptual environment for their lightweight,inexpensive, teammates that only need to rely on cameras and IMUs. We propose a numerically robust, computationally efficient approach to solve this problem via nonlinear optimization. Our method outperforms the standard approach based on the greedy algorithm, while matching the accuracy of a heuristic evolutionary scheme for global optimization at a fraction of its running time. Ultimately, we validate our solution in both photorealistic simulations and real-world experiments. In these experiments, we use lidar-based autonomous ground vehicles as the more capable agents, and vision-based aerial robots as their SWAP-constrained teammates. Our method is able to reduce drift in visual-inertial odometry by as much as 90%, and it outperforms random positioning of lidar-equipped agents by a significant margin. Furthermore, our method can be generalized to different types of robot teams with heterogeneous perception capabilities. It has a wide range of applications, such as surveying and mapping challenging dynamic environments, and enabling resilience to large-scale perturbations that can be caused by earthquakes or storms.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in Robotics: Science and Systems (RSS) 2023</p></details> |

Leveraging the proposed lightweight Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) for depth inference and encoding, we provide the network with previously marginalized sparse features from VIO to increase the accuracy of initial depth prediction and generalization capability. The compact encoded depth maps are then updated jointly with navigation states in a sliding window estimator in order to provide the dense local scene geometry. We additionally propose a novel method to obtain the CVAE's Jacobian which is shown to be more than an order of magnitude faster than previous works, and we additionally leverage First-Estimate Jacobian (FEJ) to avoid recalculation. As opposed to previous works relying on completely dense residuals, we propose to only provide sparse measurements to update the depth code and show through careful experimentation that our choice of sparse measurements and FEJs can still significantly improve the estimated depth maps. Our full system also exhibits state-of-the-art pose estimation accuracy, and we show that it can run in real-time with single-thread execution while utilizing GPU acceleration only for the network and code Jacobian.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICRA ...</summary><p>ICRA 2021; Best Paper Award in Robot Vision (Finalist)</p></details> |

The paradigm of a centralized architecture is well established, with the robots (i.e. agents) running Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) onboard while communicating relevant data, such as e.g. Keyframes (KFs), to a central back-end (i.e. server), which then merges and optimizes the joint maps of the agents. While these frameworks have proven to be successful, their capability and performance are highly dependent on the choice of the VIO front-end, thus limiting their flexibility. In this work, we present COVINS-G, a generalized back-end building upon the COVINS framework, enabling the compatibility of the server-back-end with any arbitrary VIO front-end, including, for example, off-the-shelf cameras with odometry capabilities, such as the Realsense T265. The COVINS-G back-end deploys a multi-camera relative pose estimation algorithm for computing the loop-closure constraints allowing the system to work purely on 2D image data. In the experimental evaluation, we show on-par accuracy with state-of-the-art multi-session and collaborative SLAM systems, while demonstrating the flexibility and generality of our approach by employing different front-ends onboard collaborating agents within the same mission. The COVINS-G codebase along with a generalized front-end wrapper to allow any existing VIO front-end to be readily used in combination with the proposed collaborative back-end is open-sourced.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach for VIO with stereo cameras which integrates and calibrates the velocity-control based kinematic motion model of wheeled mobile robots online. Including such a motion model can help to improve the accuracy of VIO. Compared to several previous approaches proposed to integrate wheel odometer measurements for this purpose, our method does not require wheel encoders and can be applied when the robot motion can be modeled with velocity-control based kinematic motion model. We use radial basis function (RBF) kernels to compensate for the time delay and deviations between control commands and actual robot motion. The motion model is calibrated online by the VIO system and can be used as a forward model for motion control and planning. We evaluate our approach with data obtained in variously sized indoor environments, demonstrate improvements over a pure VIO method, and evaluate the prediction accuracy of the online calibrated model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L) 2022</p></details> |
| **[SM/VIO: Robust Underwater State Estimation Switching Between Model-based and Visual Inertial Odometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01988v1)** | 2023-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the robustness problem of visual-inertial state estimation for underwater operations. Underwater robots operating in a challenging environment are required to know their pose at all times. All vision-based localization schemes are prone to failure due to poor visibility conditions, color loss, and lack of features. The proposed approach utilizes a model of the robot's kinematics together with proprioceptive sensors to maintain the pose estimate during visual-inertial odometry (VIO) failures. Furthermore, the trajectories from successful VIO and the ones from the model-driven odometry are integrated in a coherent set that maintains a consistent pose at all times. Health-monitoring tracks the VIO process ensuring timely switches between the two estimators. Finally, loop closure is implemented on the overall trajectory. The resulting framework is a robust estimator switching between model-based and visual-inertial odometry (SM/VIO). Experimental results from numerous deployments of the Aqua2 vehicle demonstrate the robustness of our approach over coral reefs and a shipwreck.</p></details> |  |

The main advantage of the proposed method is that the updates on the position of the landmarks are based on a Bundle Adjustment technique that can be parallelised over the landmarks. The performance of the method is demonstrated in simulations in different environments and with different types of robot trajectory. Circular and wiggling patterns in the trajectory lead to better estimation performance than straight ones, confirming what is expected from recent nonlinear observability theory.</p></details> |  |

Uncertainty is computed using Monte-Carlo simulations of a sufficiently exciting trajectory in the midst of a point cloud that bypass the typical image processing and feature tracking steps. We find that attribution errors have the largest detrimental effect on performance. Even with just small amounts of Gaussian noise and/or drift, however, the probability that XIVO's performance resembles the mean performance when noise and/or drift is artificially high is greater than 1 in 100.</p></details> |  |

Our approach performs global scale and shift alignment against sparse metric depth, followed by learning-based dense alignment. We evaluate on the TartanAir and VOID datasets, observing up to 30% reduction in inverse RMSE with dense scale alignment relative to performing just global alignment alone.

Since such applications are oftentimes not limited to predefined target domains and learning-based vision systems are known to generalize poorly to unseen environments, methods for continual adaptation during inference time are of significant interest. In this work, we introduce CoVIO for online continual learning of visual-inertial odometry. CoVIO effectively adapts to new domains while mitigating catastrophic forgetting by exploiting experience replay. In particular, we propose a novel sampling strategy to maximize image diversity in a fixed-size replay buffer that targets the limited storage capacity of embedded devices. We further provide an asynchronous version that decouples the odometry estimation from the network weight update step enabling continuous inference in real time. We extensively evaluate CoVIO on various real-world datasets demonstrating that it successfully adapts to new domains while outperforming previous methods.

In this paper, we propose partial IEKF (PIEKF), which only incorporates rotation-velocity state into the Lie group structure and apply it for Visual-Inertial-Wheel Odometry (VIWO) to improve positioning accuracy and consistency. Specifically, we derive the rotation-velocity measurement model, which combines wheel measurements with kinematic constraints. The model circumvents the wheel odometer's 3D integration and covariance propagation, which is essential for filter consistency. And a plane constraint is also introduced to enhance the position accuracy. A dynamic outlier detection method is adopted, leveraging the velocity state output. Through the simulation and real-world test, we validate the effectiveness of our approach, which outperforms the standard Multi-State Constraint Kalman Filter (MSCKF) based VIWO in consistency and accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by the mammal's visual system, which gazes at specific objects, we develop two novel constraints relating time-to-contact, acceleration, and distance that we call the $\tau$-constraint and $\Phi$-constraint. They allow an active (moving) camera to estimate depth efficiently and accurately while using only a small portion of the image. The constraints are applicable to range sensing, sensor fusion, and visual servoing. We successfully validate the proposed constraints with two experiments. The first applies both constraints in a trajectory estimation task with a monocular camera and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). Our methods achieve 30-70% less average trajectory error while running 25$\times$ and 6.2$\times$ faster than the popular Visual-Inertial Odometry methods VINS-Mono and ROVIO respectively. The second experiment demonstrates that when the constraints are used for feedback with efference copies the resulting closed loop system's eigenvalues are invariant to scaling of the applied control signal. We believe these results indicate the $\tau$ and $\Phi$ constraint's potential as the basis of robust and efficient algorithms for a multitude of robotic applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 24 figures, 1 table.

Conventional fusion methods use low-accuracy pseudorange based GNSS measurements ($>>5m$ errors) and can only yield a coarse registration to the global earth-centered-earth-fixed (ECEF) frame. In this paper, we leverage high-precision GNSS carrier-phase positioning and aid it with local visual-inertial odometry (VIO) tracking using an extended Kalman filter (EKF) framework that better resolves the integer ambiguity concerned with GNSS carrier-phase. %to achieve centimeter-level accuracy in the ECEF frame. We also propose an algorithm for accurate GNSS-antenna-to-IMU extrinsics calibration to accurately align VIO to the ECEF frame. Together, our system achieves robust global positioning demonstrated by real-world hardware experiments in severely occluded urban canyons, and outperforms the state-of-the-art RTKLIB by a significant margin in terms of integer ambiguity solution fix rate and positioning RMSE accuracy.</p></details> |  |

To this end, global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) can provide absolute measurements outdoors and, therefore, eliminate long-term drift. However, fusing GNSS data with other sensor data is not trivial, especially when a robot moves between areas with and without sky view. We propose a robust approach that tightly fuses raw GNSS receiver data with inertial measurements and, optionally, lidar observations for precise and smooth mobile robot localization. A factor graph with two types of GNSS factors is proposed. First, factors based on pseudoranges, which allow for global localization on Earth. Second, factors based on carrier phases, which enable highly accurate relative localization, which is useful when other sensing modalities are challenged. Unlike traditional differential GNSS, this approach does not require a connection to a base station. On a public urban driving dataset, our approach achieves accuracy comparable to a state-of-the-art algorithm that fuses visual inertial odometry with GNSS data -- despite our approach not using the camera, just inertial and GNSS data. We also demonstrate the robustness of our approach using data from a car and a quadruped robot moving in environments with little sky visibility, such as a forest. The accuracy in the global Earth frame is still 1-2 m, while the estimated trajectories are discontinuity-free and smooth. We also show how lidar measurements can be tightly integrated. We believe this is the first system that fuses raw GNSS observations (as opposed to fixes) with lidar in a factor graph.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, accompanying video: https://youtu.be/55BLjt6ce1Y, accepted to the 2023 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)</p></details> |

It is inexpensive, lightweight, and it is not affected by perceptual degradation. However, only relying on the integration of the inertial measurements for state estimation is infeasible. The errors and time-varying biases present in such measurements cause the accumulation of large drift in the pose estimates. Recently, inertial odometry has made significant progress in estimating the motion of pedestrians. State-of-the-art algorithms rely on learning a motion prior that is typical of humans but cannot be transferred to drones. In this work, we propose a learning-based odometry algorithm that uses an inertial measurement unit (IMU) as the only sensor modality for autonomous drone racing tasks. The core idea of our system is to couple a model-based filter, driven by the inertial measurements, with a learning-based module that has access to the thrust measurements. We show that our inertial odometry algorithm is superior to the state-of-the-art filter-based and optimization-based visual-inertial odometry as well as the state-of-the-art learned-inertial odometry in estimating the pose of an autonomous racing drone. Additionally, we show that our system is comparable to a visual-inertial odometry solution that uses a camera and exploits the known gate location and appearance. We believe that the application in autonomous drone racing paves the way for novel research in inertial odometry for agile quadrotor flight.</p></details> |  |

The fusion system gradually degrades to Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) with the number of satellites decreasing, which guarantees robust global navigation in GNSS unfriendly environments. In this letter, we propose an open-sourced invariant filter-based platform, InGVIO, to tightly fuse monocular/stereo visual-inertial measurements, along with raw data from GNSS. InGVIO gives highly competitive results in terms of computational load compared to current graph-based algorithms, meanwhile possessing the same or even better level of accuracy. Thanks to our proposed marginalization strategies, the baseline for triangulation is large although only a few cloned poses are kept. Moreover, we define the infinitesimal symmetries of the system and exploit the various structures of its symmetry group, being different from the total symmetries of the VIO case, which elegantly gives results for the pattern of degenerate motions and the structure of unobservable subspaces. We prove that the properly-chosen invariant error is still compatible with all possible symmetry group structures of InGVIO and has intrinsic consistency properties. Besides, InGVIO has strictly linear error propagation without linearization error. InGVIO is tested on both open datasets and our proposed fixed-wing datasets with variable levels of difficulty and various numbers of satellites. The latter datasets, to the best of our knowledge, are the first datasets open-sourced to the community on a fixed-wing aircraft with raw GNSS.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, accepted by IEEE RA-L</p></details> |

Reliability analysis and fair performance comparison of several methods integrated into a control pipeline for achieving full autonomy in real conditions is provided. Although most VIO algorithms achieve excellent localization precision and negligible drift on artificially created datasets, the aspects of reliability in non-ideal situations, robustness to degraded sensor data, and the effects of external disturbances and feedback control coupling are not well studied. These imperfections, which are inherently present in cases of real-world deployment of UAVs, negatively affect the ability of the most used VIO approaches to output a sensible pose estimation. We identify the conditions that are critical for a reliable flight under VIO localization and propose workarounds and compensations for situations in which such conditions cannot be achieved. The performance of the UAV system with integrated VIO methods is quantitatively analyzed w.r.t. RTK ground truth and the ability to provide reliable pose estimation for the feedback control is demonstrated onboard a UAV that is tracking dynamic trajectories under challenging illumination.</p></details> |  |

| **[A 2D Georeferenced Map Aided Visual-Inertial System for Precise UAV Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.05851v2)** | 2022-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Precise geolocalization is crucial for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). However, most current deployed UAVs rely on the global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) or high precision inertial navigation systems (INS) for geolocalization. In this paper, we propose to use a lightweight visual-inertial system with a 2D georeference map to obtain accurate and consecutive geodetic positions for UAVs. The proposed system firstly integrates a micro inertial measurement unit (MIMU) and a monocular camera as odometry to consecutively estimate the navigation states and reconstruct the 3D position of the observed visual features in the local world frame. To obtain the geolocation, the visual features tracked by the odometry are further registered to the 2D georeferenced map. While most conventional methods perform image-level aerial image registration, we propose to align the reconstructed points to the map points in the geodetic frame; this helps to filter out the large portion of outliers and decouples the negative effects from the horizontal angles. The registered points are then used to relocalize the vehicle in the geodetic frame. Finally, a pose graph is deployed to fuse the geolocation from the aerial image registration and the local navigation result from the visual-inertial odometry (VIO) to achieve consecutive and drift-free geolocalization performance. We have validated the proposed method by installing the sensors to a UAV body rigidly and have conducted two flights in different environments with unknown initials. The results show that the proposed method can achieve less than 4m position error in flight at 100m high and less than 9m position error in flight about 300m high.</p></details> |  |

This paper develops a novel Lie group symmetry for the VIO problem and applies the recently proposed equivariant filter. The symmetry is shown to be compatible with the invariance of the VIO reference frame, lead to exact linearisation of bias-free IMU dynamics, and provide equivariance of the visual measurement function. As a result, the equivariant filter (EqF) based on this Lie group is a consistent estimator for VIO with lower linearisation error in the propagation of state dynamics and a higher order equivariant output approximation than standard formulations. Experimental results on the popular EuRoC and UZH FPV datasets demonstrate that the proposed system outperforms other state-of-the-art VIO algorithms in terms of both speed and accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 17 figures, submitted to IEEE TRO</p></details> |
| **[Safety-quantifiable Line Feature-based Monocular Visual Localization with 3D Prior Map](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15127v1)** | 2022-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and safety-quantifiable localization is of great significance for safety-critical autonomous systems, such as unmanned ground vehicles (UGV) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). The visual odometry-based method can provide accurate positioning in a short period but is subjected to drift over time. Moreover, the quantification of the safety of the localization solution (the error is bounded by a certain value) is still a challenge. To fill the gaps, this paper proposes a safety-quantifiable line feature-based visual localization method with a prior map. The visual-inertial odometry provides a high-frequency local pose estimation which serves as the initial guess for the visual localization. By obtaining a visual line feature pair association, a foot point-based constraint is proposed to construct the cost function between the 2D lines extracted from the real-time image and the 3D lines extracted from the high-precision prior 3D point cloud map. Moreover, a global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM) inspired method is employed to quantify the safety of the derived localization solution. Among that, an outlier rejection (also well-known as fault detection and exclusion) strategy is employed via the weighted sum of squares residual with a Chi-squared probability distribution. A protection level (PL) scheme considering multiple outliers is derived and utilized to quantify the potential error bound of the localization solution in both position and rotation domains. The effectiveness of the proposed safety-quantifiable localization system is verified using the datasets collected in the UAV indoor and UGV outdoor environments.</p></details> |  |

We propose DynaVIG, a navigation and object tracking system based on the integration of Monocular Vision, Inertial Navigation System (INS), and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). Our system aims to provide an accurate global estimation of the navigation states and object poses for the automated ground vehicle (AGV) in dynamic scenes. Due to the scale ambiguity of the object, a prior height model is proposed to initialize the object pose, and the scale is continuously estimated with the aid of GNSS and INS. To precisely track the object with complex moving, we establish an accurate dynamics model according to its motion state. Then the multi-sensor observations are optimized in a unified framework. Experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that the multisensor fusion can effectively improve the accuracy of navigation and object tracking, compared to state-of-the-art methods. In addition, the proposed system achieves good estimation of the objects that change speed or direction.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods often lacks adaptability to diverse scenarios, exhibits limited robustness in image-based approaches, and struggles with curved or complex geometries. To address these limitations, an innovative framework for two-dimensional (2D) crack detection, three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction, and 3D automatic crack measurement was proposed by integrating computer vision technologies and multi-modal Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) in this study. Firstly, building on a base DeepLabv3+ segmentation model, and incorporating specific refinements utilizing foundation model Segment Anything Model (SAM), we developed a crack segmentation method with strong generalization across unfamiliar scenarios, enabling the generation of precise 2D crack masks. To enhance the accuracy and robustness of 3D reconstruction, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) point clouds were utilized together with image data and segmentation masks. By leveraging both image- and LiDAR-SLAM, we developed a multi-frame and multi-modal fusion framework that produces dense, colorized point clouds, effectively capturing crack semantics at a 3D real-world scale. Furthermore, the crack geometric attributions were measured automatically and directly within 3D dense point cloud space, surpassing the limitations of conventional 2D image-based measurements. This advancement makes the method suitable for structural components with curved and complex 3D geometries. Experimental results across various concrete structures highlight the significant improvements and unique advantages of the proposed method, demonstrating its effectiveness, accuracy, and robustness in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

However, even in modern SLAM solutions, ICP can degrade and become unreliable in geometrically ill-conditioned environments. Current solutions primarily focus on utilizing additional sources of information, such as external odometry, to either replace the degenerate directions of the optimization solution or add additional constraints in a sensor-fusion setup afterward. In response, this work investigates and compares new and existing degeneracy mitigation methods for robust LiDAR-based localization and analyzes the efficacy of these approaches in degenerate environments for the first time in the literature at this scale. Specifically, this work investigates i) the effect of using active or passive degeneracy mitigation methods for the problem of ill-conditioned ICP in LiDAR degenerate environments, ii) the evaluation of TSVD, inequality constraints, and linear/non-linear Tikhonov regularization for the application of degenerate point cloud registration for the first time. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis for least-squares minimization step of the ICP problem is carried out to better understand how each method affects the optimization and what to expect from each method. The results of the analysis are validated through multiple real-world robotic field and simulated experiments. The analysis demonstrates that active optimization degeneracy mitigation is necessary and advantageous in the absence of reliable external estimate assistance for LiDAR-SLAM, and soft-constrained methods can provide better results in complex ill-conditioned scenarios with heuristic fine-tuned parameters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Field Robotics</p></details> |

However, off-the-shelf LiDAR-based SLAM methods suffer from significant pose estimation drifts, particularly components relevant to the vertical direction, when passing to uneven terrains. This deficiency typically leads to a conspicuously distorted global map. In this article, a LiDAR-based SLAM method is presented to improve the accuracy of pose estimations for ground vehicles in rough terrains, which is termed Rotation-Optimized LiDAR-Only (ROLO) SLAM. The method exploits a forward location prediction to coarsely eliminate the location difference of consecutive scans, thereby enabling separate and accurate determination of the location and orientation at the front-end. Furthermore, we adopt a parallel-capable spatial voxelization for correspondence-matching. We develop a spherical alignment-guided rotation registration within each voxel to estimate the rotation of vehicle. By incorporating geometric alignment, we introduce the motion constraint into the optimization formulation to enhance the rapid and effective estimation of LiDAR's translation. Subsequently, we extract several keyframes to construct the submap and exploit an alignment from the current scan to the submap for precise pose estimation. Meanwhile, a global-scale factor graph is established to aid in the reduction of cumulative errors. In various scenes, diverse experiments have been conducted to evaluate our method. The results demonstrate that ROLO-SLAM excels in pose estimation of ground vehicles and outperforms existing state-of-the-art LiDAR SLAM frameworks.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This article has been accepted by Journal of Field Robotics</p></details> |
| **[A flexible framework for accurate LiDAR odometry, map manipulation, and localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20465v2)** | 2024-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR-based SLAM is a core technology for autonomous vehicles and robots. One key contribution of this work to 3D LiDAR SLAM and localization is a fierce defense of view-based maps (pose graphs with time-stamped sensor readings) as the fundamental representation of maps. As will be shown, they allow for the greatest flexibility, enabling the posterior generation of arbitrary metric maps optimized for particular tasks, e.g. obstacle avoidance, real-time localization. Moreover, this work introduces a new framework in which mapping pipelines can be defined without coding, defining the connections of a network of reusable blocks much like deep-learning networks are designed by connecting layers of standardized elements. We also introduce tightly-coupled estimation of linear and angular velocity vectors within the Iterative Closest Point (ICP)-like optimizer, leading to superior robustness against aggressive motion profiles without the need for an IMU. Extensive experimental validation reveals that the proposal compares well to, or improves, former state-of-the-art (SOTA) LiDAR odometry systems, while also successfully mapping some hard sequences where others diverge. A proposed self-adaptive configuration has been used, without parameter changes, for all 3D LiDAR datasets with sensors between 16 and 128 rings, and has been extensively tested on 83 sequences over more than 250~km of automotive, hand-held, airborne, and quadruped LiDAR datasets, both indoors and outdoors. The system flexibility is demonstrated with additional configurations for 2D LiDARs and for building 3D NDT-like maps. The framework is open-sourced online: https://github.com/MOLAorg/mola</p></details> | 45 pages, 35 figures |
| **[Selective Kalman Filter: When and How to Fuse Multi-Sensor Information to Overcome Degeneracy in SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17235v1)** | 2024-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Research trends in SLAM systems are now focusing more on multi-sensor fusion to handle challenging and degenerative environments. However, most existing multi-sensor fusion SLAM methods mainly use all of the data from a range of sensors, a strategy we refer to as the all-in method. This method, while merging the benefits of different sensors, also brings in their weaknesses, lowering the robustness and accuracy and leading to high computational demands. To address this, we propose a new fusion approach -- Selective Kalman Filter -- to carefully choose and fuse information from multiple sensors (using LiDAR and visual observations as examples in this paper). For deciding when to fuse data, we implement degeneracy detection in LiDAR SLAM, incorporating visual measurements only when LiDAR SLAM exhibits degeneracy. Regarding degeneracy detection, we propose an elegant yet straightforward approach to determine the degeneracy of LiDAR SLAM and to identify the specific degenerative direction. This method fully considers the coupled relationship between rotational and translational constraints. In terms of how to fuse data, we use visual measurements only to update the specific degenerative states. As a result, our proposed method improves upon the all-in method by greatly enhancing real-time performance due to less processing visual data, and it introduces fewer errors from visual measurements. Experiments demonstrate that our method for degeneracy detection and fusion, in addressing degeneracy issues, exhibits higher precision and robustness compared to other state-of-the-art methods, and offers enhanced real-time performance relative to the all-in method. The code is openly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Real-time Degeneracy Sensing and Compensation Method for Enhanced LiDAR SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07513v1)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR is widely used in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and autonomous driving. The LiDAR odometry is of great importance in multi-sensor fusion. However, in some unstructured environments, the point cloud registration cannot constrain the poses of the LiDAR due to its sparse geometric features, which leads to the degeneracy of multi-sensor fusion accuracy. To address this problem, we propose a novel real-time approach to sense and compensate for the degeneracy of LiDAR. Firstly, this paper introduces the degeneracy factor with clear meaning, which can measure the degeneracy of LiDAR. Then, the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) clustering method adaptively perceives the degeneracy with better environmental generalization. Finally, the degeneracy perception results are utilized to fuse LiDAR and IMU, thus effectively resisting degeneracy effects. Experiments on our dataset show the method's high accuracy and robustness and validate our algorithm's adaptability to different environments and LiDAR scanning modalities.</p></details> | 13 pages |
| **[LiDAR SLAMMOT based on Confidence-guided Data Association](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01041v1)** | 2024-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the field of autonomous driving or robotics, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and multi-object tracking (MOT) are two fundamental problems and are generally applied separately. Solutions to SLAM and MOT usually rely on certain assumptions, such as the static environment assumption for SLAM and the accurate ego-vehicle pose assumption for MOT. But in complex dynamic environments, it is difficult or even impossible to meet these assumptions. Therefore, the SLAMMOT, i.e., simultaneous localization, mapping, and moving object tracking, integrated system of SLAM and object tracking, has emerged for autonomous vehicles in dynamic environments. However, many conventional SLAMMOT solutions directly perform data association on the predictions and detections for object tracking, but ignore their quality. In practice, inaccurate predictions caused by continuous multi-frame missed detections in temporary occlusion scenarios, may degrade the performance of tracking, thereby affecting SLAMMOT. To address this challenge, this paper presents a LiDAR SLAMMOT based on confidence-guided data association (Conf SLAMMOT) method, which tightly couples the LiDAR SLAM and the confidence-guided data association based multi-object tracking into a graph optimization backend for estimating the state of the ego-vehicle and objects simultaneously. The confidence of prediction and detection are applied in the factor graph-based multi-object tracking for its data association, which not only avoids the performance degradation caused by incorrect initial assignments in some filter-based methods but also handles issues such as continuous missed detection in tracking while also improving the overall performance of SLAMMOT. Various comparative experiments demonstrate the superior advantages of Conf SLAMMOT, especially in scenes with some missed detections.</p></details> |  |
| **[SGLC: Semantic Graph-Guided Coarse-Fine-Refine Full Loop Closing for LiDAR SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08106v2)** | 2024-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Loop closing is a crucial component in SLAM that helps eliminate accumulated errors through two main steps: loop detection and loop pose correction. The first step determines whether loop closing should be performed, while the second estimates the 6-DoF pose to correct odometry drift. Current methods mostly focus on developing robust descriptors for loop closure detection, often neglecting loop pose estimation. A few methods that do include pose estimation either suffer from low accuracy or incur high computational costs. To tackle this problem, we introduce SGLC, a real-time semantic graph-guided full loop closing method, with robust loop closure detection and 6-DoF pose estimation capabilities. SGLC takes into account the distinct characteristics of foreground and background points. For foreground instances, it builds a semantic graph that not only abstracts point cloud representation for fast descriptor generation and matching but also guides the subsequent loop verification and initial pose estimation. Background points, meanwhile, are exploited to provide more geometric features for scan-wise descriptor construction and stable planar information for further pose refinement. Loop pose estimation employs a \mbox{coarse-fine-refine} registration scheme that considers the alignment of both instance points and background points, offering high efficiency and accuracy. Extensive experiments on multiple publicly available datasets demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we integrate SGLC into a SLAM system, eliminating accumulated errors and improving overall SLAM performance. The implementation of SGLC will be released at https://github.com/nubot-nudt/SGLC.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |
| **[LiDAR Inertial Odometry And Mapping Using Learned Registration-Relevant Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02961v1)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>SLAM is an important capability for many autonomous systems, and modern LiDAR-based methods offer promising performance. However, for long duration missions, existing works that either operate directly the full pointclouds or on extracted features face key tradeoffs in accuracy and computational efficiency (e.g., memory consumption). To address these issues, this paper presents DFLIOM with several key innovations. Unlike previous methods that rely on handcrafted heuristics and hand-tuned parameters for feature extraction, we propose a learning-based approach that select points relevant to LiDAR SLAM pointcloud registration. Furthermore, we extend our prior work DLIOM with the learned feature extractor and observe our method enables similar or even better localization performance using only about 20\% of the points in the dense point clouds. We demonstrate that DFLIOM performs well on multiple public benchmarks, achieving a 2.4\% decrease in localization error and 57.5\% decrease in memory usage compared to state-of-the-art methods (DLIOM). Although extracting features with the proposed network requires extra time, it is offset by the faster processing time downstream, thus maintaining real-time performance using 20Hz LiDAR on our hardware setup. The effectiveness of our learning-based feature extraction module is further demonstrated through comparison with several handcrafted feature extractors.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |

Current SLAM systems can achieve centimeter-level accuracy within a short period. However, there are still several challenges when dealing with largescale mapping tasks including significant storage requirements and difficulty of reusing the constructed maps. To address this, we first design an elastic and lightweight map representation called CELLmap, composed of several CELLs, each representing the local map at the corresponding location. Then, we design a general backend including CELL-based bidirectional registration module and loop closure detection module to improve global map consistency. Our experiments have demonstrated that CELLmap can represent the precise geometric structure of large-scale maps of KITTI dataset using only about 60 MB. Additionally, our general backend achieves up to a 26.88% improvement over various LiDAR odometry methods.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Evaluating and Improving the Robustness of LiDAR-based Localization and Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10824v1)** | 2024-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR is one of the most commonly adopted sensors for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and map-based global localization. SLAM and map-based localization are crucial for the independent operation of autonomous systems, especially when external signals such as GNSS are unavailable or unreliable. While state-of-the-art (SOTA) LiDAR SLAM systems could achieve 0.5% (i.e., 0.5m per 100m) of errors and map-based localization could achieve centimeter-level global localization, it is still unclear how robust they are under various common LiDAR data corruptions. In this work, we extensively evaluated five SOTA LiDAR-based localization systems under 18 common scene-level LiDAR point cloud data (PCD) corruptions. We found that the robustness of LiDAR-based localization varies significantly depending on the category. For SLAM, hand-crafted methods are in general robust against most types of corruption, while being extremely vulnerable (up to +80% errors) to a specific corruption. Learning-based methods are vulnerable to most types of corruptions. For map-based global localization, we found that the SOTA is resistant to all applied corruptions. Finally, we found that simple Bilateral Filter denoising effectively eliminates noise-based corruption but is not helpful in density-based corruption. Re-training is more effective in defending learning-based SLAM against all types of corruption.</p></details> |  |

GEODE comprises 64 trajectories spanning over 64 kilometers across seven diverse settings with varying degrees of degeneracy. The data was meticulously collected to promote the development of versatile algorithms by incorporating various LiDAR sensors, stereo cameras, IMUs, and diverse motion conditions.

In this paper, we propose a SLAM system for building globally consistent maps, called PIN-SLAM, that is based on an elastic and compact point-based implicit neural map representation. Taking range measurements as input, our approach alternates between incremental learning of the local implicit signed distance field and the pose estimation given the current local map using a correspondence-free, point-to-implicit model registration. Our implicit map is based on sparse optimizable neural points, which are inherently elastic and deformable with the global pose adjustment when closing a loop. Loops are also detected using the neural point features. Extensive experiments validate that PIN-SLAM is robust to various environments and versatile to different range sensors such as LiDAR and RGB-D cameras. PIN-SLAM achieves pose estimation accuracy better or on par with the state-of-the-art LiDAR odometry or SLAM systems and outperforms the recent neural implicit SLAM approaches while maintaining a more consistent, and highly compact implicit map that can be reconstructed as accurate and complete meshes. Finally, thanks to the voxel hashing for efficient neural points indexing and the fast implicit map-based registration without closest point association, PIN-SLAM can run at the sensor frame rate on a moderate GPU. Codes will be available at: https://github.com/PRBonn/PIN_SLAM.</p></details> | 20 pages |

However, the utilization of 2D LiDAR in Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) frequently encounters challenges related to motion degeneracy, particularly in geometrically similar environments. To address this problem, this paper proposes a robust, accurate, and multi-sensor-fused 2D LiDAR SLAM system specifically designed for indoor mobile robots. To commence, the original LiDAR data undergoes meticulous processing through point and line extraction. Leveraging the distinctive characteristics of indoor environments, line-line constraints are established to complement other sensor data effectively, thereby augmenting the overall robustness and precision of the system. Concurrently, a tightly-coupled front-end is created, integrating data from the 2D LiDAR, IMU, and wheel odometry, thus enabling real-time state estimation. Building upon this solid foundation, a novel global feature point matching-based loop closure detection algorithm is proposed. This algorithm proves highly effective in mitigating front-end accumulated errors and ultimately constructs a globally consistent map. The experimental results indicate that our system fully meets real-time requirements. When compared to Cartographer, our system not only exhibits lower trajectory errors but also demonstrates stronger robustness, particularly in degeneracy problem.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by Measurement Science and Technology: https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6501/ad3ea3/meta</p></details> |

However, the measurement process is demanding, requiring up to two days per hectare for data collection, significant data storage, as well as resource-heavy post-processing of 3D data. In this work, we present a real-time mapping and analysis system that enables online generation of forest inventories using mobile laser scanners that can be mounted e.g. on mobile robots. Given incrementally created and locally accurate submaps-data payloads-our approach extracts tree candidates using a custom, Voronoi-inspired clustering algorithm. Tree candidates are reconstructed using an adapted Hough algorithm, which enables robust modeling of the tree stem. Further, we explicitly incorporate the incremental nature of the data collection by consistently updating the database using a pose graph LiDAR SLAM system. This enables us to refine our estimates of the tree traits if an area is revisited later during a mission. We demonstrate competitive accuracy to TLS or manual measurements using laser scanners that we mounted on backpacks or mobile robots operating in conifer, broad-leaf and mixed forests. Our results achieve RMSE of 1.93 cm, a bias of 0.65 cm and a standard deviation of 1.81 cm (averaged across these sequences)-with no post-processing required after the mission is complete.</p></details> |  |

Existing implicit mapping methods for LiDAR show promising results in large-scale reconstruction, but either require groundtruth poses or run slower than real-time. In contrast, LONER uses LiDAR data to train an MLP to estimate a dense map in real-time, while simultaneously estimating the trajectory of the sensor. To achieve real-time performance, this paper proposes a novel information-theoretic loss function that accounts for the fact that different regions of the map may be learned to varying degrees throughout online training. The proposed method is evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively on two open-source datasets. This evaluation illustrates that the proposed loss function converges faster and leads to more accurate geometry reconstruction than other loss functions used in depth-supervised neural implicit frameworks. Finally, this paper shows that LONER estimates trajectories competitively with state-of-the-art LiDAR SLAM methods, while also producing dense maps competitive with existing real-time implicit mapping methods that use groundtruth poses.</p></details> | <details><summary>First...</summary><p>First two authors equally contributed.

It then grew to implement Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) on various robots and mobile platforms. As each application brings its own set of contraints on sensors, processing capabilities and locomotion, it raises the question of which SLAM approach is the most appropriate to use in terms of cost, accuracy, computation power and ease of integration. Since most of SLAM approaches are either visual or lidar-based, comparison is difficult. Therefore, we decided to extend RTAB-Map to support both visual and lidar SLAM, providing in one package a tool allowing users to implement and compare a variety of 3D and 2D solutions for a wide range of applications with different robots and sensors. This paper presents this extended version of RTAB-Map and its use in comparing, both quantitatively and qualitatively, a large selection of popular real-world datasets (e.g., KITTI, EuRoC, TUM RGB-D, MIT Stata Center on PR2 robot), outlining strengths and limitations of visual and lidar SLAM configurations from a practical perspective for autonomous navigation applications.</p></details> | 40 pages, 19 figures |

Many applications require such a system, including construction, robotic navigation, long-term autonomy, and environmental monitoring. We focus on the semi-static scenario where objects are added, subtracted, or changed in position over weeks or months. Our system combines multi-mission LiDAR SLAM, volumetric differencing, object instance description, and correspondence grouping using learned descriptors to keep track of an open set of objects. Object correspondences between missions are determined by clustering the object's learned descriptors. We demonstrate our approach using datasets collected in a simulated environment and a real-world dataset captured using a LiDAR system mounted on a quadruped robot monitoring an industrial facility containing static, semi-static, and dynamic objects. Our method demonstrates superior performance in detecting changes in semi-static environments compared to existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+n p...</summary><p>6+n page limit for (accepted) ICRA 2024 submission</p></details> |
| **[Quatro++: Robust Global Registration Exploiting Ground Segmentation for Loop Closing in LiDAR SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00928v2)** | 2024-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Global registration is a fundamental task that estimates the relative pose between two viewpoints of 3D point clouds. However, there are two issues that degrade the performance of global registration in LiDAR SLAM: one is the sparsity issue and the other is degeneracy. The sparsity issue is caused by the sparse characteristics of the 3D point cloud measurements in a mechanically spinning LiDAR sensor. The degeneracy issue sometimes occurs because the outlier-rejection methods reject too many correspondences, leaving less than three inliers. These two issues have become more severe as the pose discrepancy between the two viewpoints of 3D point clouds becomes greater. To tackle these problems, we propose a robust global registration framework, called \textit{Quatro++}. Extending our previous work that solely focused on the global registration itself, we address the robust global registration in terms of the loop closing in LiDAR SLAM. To this end, ground segmentation is exploited to achieve robust global registration. Through the experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed method shows a higher success rate than the state-of-the-art global registration methods, overcoming the sparsity and degeneracy issues. In addition, we show that ground segmentation significantly helps to increase the success rate for the ground vehicles. Finally, we apply our proposed method to the loop closing module in LiDAR SLAM and confirm that the quality of the loop constraints is improved, showing more precise mapping results. Therefore, the experimental evidence corroborated the suitability of our method as an initial alignment in the loop closing. Our code is available at https://quatro-plusplus.github.io.</p></details> | 26 pages, 23 figures |
| **[Versatile LiDAR-Inertial Odometry With SE (2) Constraints for Ground Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01584v1)** | 2023-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR SLAM has become one of the major localization systems for ground vehicles since LiDAR Odometry And Mapping (LOAM). Many extension works on LOAM mainly leverage one specific constraint to improve the performance, e.g., information from on-board sensors such as loop closure and inertial state; prior conditions such as ground level and motion dynamics. In many robotic applications, these conditions are often known partially, hence a SLAM system can be a comprehensive problem due to the existence of numerous constraints. Therefore, we can achieve a better SLAM result by fusing them properly. In this paper, we propose a hybrid LiDAR-inertial SLAM framework that leverages both the on-board perception system and prior information such as motion dynamics to improve localization performance. In particular, we consider the case for ground vehicles, which are commonly used for autonomous driving and warehouse logistics. We present a computationally efficient LiDAR-inertial odometry method that directly parameterizes ground vehicle poses on SE(2). The out-of-SE(2) motion perturbations are not neglected but incorporated into an integrated noise term of a novel SE(2)-constraints model. For odometric measurement processing, we propose a versatile, tightly coupled LiDAR-inertial odometry to achieve better pose estimation than traditional LiDAR odometry. Thorough experiments are performed to evaluate our proposed method's performance in different scenarios, including localization for both indoor and outdoor environments. The proposed method achieves superior performance in accuracy and robustness.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches either rely on dense point clouds to achieve high localization accuracy or use generalized descriptors to reduce map size. Unfortunately, these two aspects seem to conflict with each other. To address this limitation, we propose a unified architecture, DeepPointMap, achieving excellent preference on both aspects. We utilize neural network to extract highly representative and sparse neural descriptors from point clouds, enabling memory-efficient map representation and accurate multi-scale localization tasks (e.g., odometry and loop-closure). Moreover, we showcase the versatility of our framework by extending it to more challenging multi-agent collaborative SLAM. The promising results obtained in these scenarios further emphasize the effectiveness and potential of our approach.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes, ECMD, an event-centric multisensory dataset containing 81 sequences and covering over 200 km of various challenging driving scenarios including high-speed motion, repetitive scenarios, dynamic objects, etc. ECMD provides data from two sets of stereo event cameras with different resolutions (640*480, 346*260), stereo industrial cameras, an infrared camera, a top-installed mechanical LiDAR with two slanted LiDARs, two consumer-level GNSS receivers, and an onboard IMU. Meanwhile, the ground-truth of the vehicle was obtained using a centimeter-level high-accuracy GNSS-RTK/INS navigation system. All sensors are well-calibrated and temporally synchronized at the hardware level, with recording data simultaneously. We additionally evaluate several state-of-the-art SLAM algorithms for benchmarking visual and LiDAR SLAM and identifying their limitations.

This article begins by formulating loop closing and relocalization within a unified framework. Then, we propose a novel multi-head network LCR-Net to tackle both tasks effectively. It exploits novel feature extraction and pose-aware attention mechanism to precisely estimate similarities and 6-DoF poses between pairs of LiDAR scans. In the end, we integrate our LCR-Net into a SLAM system and achieve robust and accurate online LiDAR SLAM in outdoor driving environments. We thoroughly evaluate our LCR-Net through three setups derived from loop closing and relocalization, including candidate retrieval, closed-loop point cloud registration, and continuous relocalization using multiple datasets. The results demonstrate that LCR-Net excels in all three tasks, surpassing the state-of-the-art methods and exhibiting a remarkable generalization ability. Notably, our LCR-Net outperforms baseline methods without using a time-consuming robust pose estimator, rendering it suitable for online SLAM applications. To our best knowledge, the integration of LCR-Net yields the first LiDAR SLAM with the capability of deep loop closing and relocalization. The implementation of our methods will be made open-source.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages 10 figures 7 tables</p></details> |

This new capability is beneficial for perceptions in various use cases, but it is challenging for resource-constrained mobile devices to use the perceptions in real-time because of their high computational complexity. In this context, edge computing can be used to enable LiDAR online perceptions, but offloading the perceptions on the edge server requires a low-latency, lightweight, and efficient compression due to the large volume of LiDAR point clouds data. This paper presents FLiCR, a fast and lightweight LiDAR point cloud compression method for enabling edge-assisted online perceptions. FLiCR is based on range images (RI) as an intermediate representation (IR), and dictionary coding for compressing RIs. FLiCR achieves its benefits by leveraging lossy RIs, and we show the efficiency of bytestream compression is largely improved with quantization and subsampling. In addition, we identify the limitation of current quality metrics for presenting the entropy of a point cloud, and introduce a new metric that reflects both point-wise and entropy-wise qualities for lossy IRs. The evaluation results show FLiCR is more suitable for edge-assisted real-time perceptions than the existing LiDAR compressions, and we demonstrate the effectiveness of our compression and metric with the evaluations on 3D object detection and LiDAR SLAM.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 11 figures, conference paper</p></details> |

But the LiDAR-SLAM could be disturbed by current scene moving objects, resulting in drift errors and even loop-closure failure. Thus, the ability to detect and segment moving objects is essential for high-precision positioning and building a consistent map. In this paper, we address the problem of moving object segmentation from 3D LiDAR scans to improve the odometry and loop-closure accuracy of SLAM. We propose a novel 3D Sequential Moving-Object-Segmentation (3D-SeqMOS) method that can accurately segment the scene into moving and static objects, such as moving and static cars. Different from the existing projected-image method, we process the raw 3D point cloud and build a 3D convolution neural network for MOS task. In addition, to make full use of the spatio-temporal information of point cloud, we propose a point cloud residual mechanism using the spatial features of current scan and the temporal features of previous residual scans. Besides, we build a complete SLAM framework to verify the effectiveness and accuracy of 3D-SeqMOS. Experiments on SemanticKITTI dataset show that our proposed 3D-SeqMOS method can effectively detect moving objects and improve the accuracy of LiDAR odometry and loop-closure detection. The test results show our 3D-SeqMOS outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 12.4%. We extend the proposed method to the SemanticKITTI: Moving Object Segmentation competition and achieve the 2nd in the leaderboard, showing its effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

DLIOM contains several key algorithmic innovations in both the front-end and back-end subsystems to design a resilient LiDAR-inertial architecture that is perceptive to the environment and produces accurate localization and high-fidelity 3D mapping for autonomous robotic platforms. Our ideas spawned after a deep investigation into modern LiDAR SLAM systems and their inabilities to generalize across different operating environments, in which we address several common algorithmic failure points by means of proactive safe-guards to provide long-term operational reliability in the unstructured real world. We detail several important innovations to localization accuracy and mapping resiliency distributed throughout a typical LiDAR SLAM pipeline to comprehensively increase algorithmic speed, accuracy, and robustness. In addition, we discuss insights gained from our ground-up approach while implementing such a complex system for real-time state estimation on resource-constrained systems, and we experimentally show the increased performance of our method as compared to the current state-of-the-art on both public benchmark and self-collected datasets.</p></details> |  |

Our method integrates motion compensation within a sweep with one-to-many scan registration that minimizes distances between nearby oriented surface points and mitigates outliers with a robust loss function. Extending our previous approach CFEAR, we present an in-depth investigation on a wider range of data sets, quantifying the importance of filtering, resolution, registration cost and loss functions, keyframe history, and motion compensation. We present a new solving strategy and configuration that overcomes previous issues with sparsity and bias, and improves our state-of-the-art by 38%, thus, surprisingly, outperforming radar SLAM and approaching lidar SLAM.

However, it faces many challenges in real-world scenarios, such as the prior information about the environment being absent and poor communication among the team members. This work presents DCL-SLAM, a fully distributed collaborative LiDAR SLAM framework intended for the robotic swarm to simultaneously co-localize in an unknown environment with minimal information exchange. Based on ad-hoc wireless peer-to-peer communication (limited bandwidth and communication range), DCL-SLAM adopts the lightweight LiDAR-Iris descriptor for place recognition and does not require full connectivity among teams. DCL-SLAM includes three main parts: a replaceable single-robot front-end that produces LiDAR odometry results; a distributed loop closure module that detects inter-robot loop closures with keyframes; and a distributed back-end module that adapts distributed pose graph optimizer combined with a pairwise consistent measurement set maximization algorithm to reject spurious inter-robot loop closures. We integrate our proposed framework with diverse open-source LiDAR odometry methods to show its versatility. The proposed system is extensively evaluated on benchmarking datasets and field experiments over various scales and environments. Experimental result shows that DCL-SLAM achieves higher accuracy and lower communication bandwidth than other state-of-art multi-robot SLAM systems.

| **[Marker-based Visual SLAM leveraging Hierarchical Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01155v2)** | 2023-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fiducial markers can encode rich information about the environment and can aid Visual SLAM (VSLAM) approaches in reconstructing maps with practical semantic information. Current marker-based VSLAM approaches mainly utilize markers for improving feature detections in low-feature environments and/or for incorporating loop closure constraints, generating only low-level geometric maps of the environment prone to inaccuracies in complex environments. To bridge this gap, this paper presents a VSLAM approach utilizing a monocular camera along with fiducial markers to generate hierarchical representations of the environment while improving the camera pose estimate. The proposed approach detects semantic entities from the surroundings, including walls, corridors, and rooms encoded within markers, and appropriately adds topological constraints among them. Experimental results on a real-world dataset collected with a robot demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms a traditional marker-based VSLAM baseline in terms of accuracy, given the addition of new constraints while creating enhanced map representations. Furthermore, it shows satisfactory results when comparing the reconstructed map quality to the one reconstructed using a LiDAR SLAM approach.</p></details> | 7 pages, 6 figures |

Dense maps are essential for robotic applications, such as map-based navigation. Due to the low memory cost, mesh has become an attractive dense model for mapping in recent years. However, existing methods usually produce mesh maps by using an offline post-processing step to generate mesh maps. This two-step pipeline does not allow these methods to use the built mesh maps online and to enable localization and meshing to benefit each other. To solve this problem, we propose the first CPU-only real-time LiDAR SLAM system that can simultaneously build a mesh map and perform localization against the mesh map. A novel and direct meshing strategy with Gaussian process reconstruction realizes the fast building, registration, and updating of mesh maps. We perform experiments on several public datasets. The results show that our SLAM system can run at around $40$Hz. The localization and meshing accuracy also outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, including the TSDF map and Poisson reconstruction.

We demonstrate by experiments that the accuracy and robustness of the LiDAR SLAM system are both improved. Finally, we have done systematic experimental tests at the Hong Kong science park as well as other indoor or outdoor real complicated testing circumstances, which demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach. It is demonstrated that our system has high accuracy, robustness, as well as efficiency.

From our experiments, we find that current LiDAR SLAM systems have limited performance when the noise level in the obtained point clouds is large. Therefore, in this work, we propose a general framework to tackle the problem of denoising and loop closure for LiDAR SLAM in complex environments with many noises and outliers caused by reflective materials. Current approaches for point clouds denoising are mainly designed for small-scale point clouds and can not be extended to large-scale point clouds scenes. In this work, we firstly proposed a lightweight network for large-scale point clouds denoising. Subsequently, we have also designed an efficient loop closure network for place recognition in global optimization to improve the localization accuracy of the whole system. Finally, we have demonstrated by extensive experiments and benchmark studies that our method can have a significant boost on the localization accuracy of the LiDAR SLAM system when faced with noisy point clouds, with a marginal increase in computational cost.</p></details> | IROS 2022 |

The solutions to these problems are generally based on their respective assumptions, \ie{the static world assumption for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and the accurate ego-pose assumption for object tracking}. However, these assumptions are challenging to hold in dynamic road scenarios, where SLAM and object tracking become closely correlated. Therefore, we propose DL-SLOT, a dynamic LiDAR SLAM and object tracking method, to simultaneously address these two coupled problems. This method integrates the state estimations of both the autonomous vehicle and the stationary and dynamic objects in the environment into a unified optimization framework. First, we used object detection to identify all points belonging to potentially dynamic objects. Subsequently, a LiDAR odometry was conducted using the filtered point cloud. Simultaneously, we proposed a sliding window-based object association method that accurately associates objects according to the historical trajectories of tracked objects. The ego-states and those of the stationary and dynamic objects are integrated into the sliding window-based collaborative graph optimization. The stationary objects are subsequently restored from the potentially dynamic object set. Finally, a global pose-graph is implemented to eliminate the accumulated error. Experiments on KITTI datasets demonstrate that our method achieves better accuracy than SLAM and object tracking baseline methods. This confirms that solving SLAM and object tracking simultaneously is mutually advantageous, dramatically improving the robustness and accuracy of SLAM and object tracking in dynamic road scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 10 figures, this work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

In the field of visual SLAM, bag of words (BoW) has achieved great success in loop closure. The BoW features for loop searching can also be used in the subsequent 6-DoF loop correction. However, for 3D LiDAR SLAM, the state-of-the-art methods may fail to effectively recognize the loop in real time, and usually cannot correct the full 6-DoF loop pose. To address this limitation, we present a novel Bag of Words for real-time loop closing in 3D LiDAR SLAM, called BoW3D. Our method not only efficiently recognizes the revisited loop places, but also corrects the full 6-DoF loop pose in real time. BoW3D builds the bag of words based on the 3D LiDAR feature LinK3D, which is efficient, pose-invariant and can be used for accurate point-to-point matching. We furthermore embed our proposed method into 3D LiDAR odometry system to evaluate loop closing performance. We test our method on public dataset, and compare it against other state-of-the-art algorithms. BoW3D shows better performance in terms of F1 max and extended precision scores on most scenarios. It is noticeable that BoW3D takes an average of 48 ms to recognize and correct the loops on KITTI 00 (includes 4K+ 64-ray LiDAR scans), when executed on a notebook with an Intel Core i7 @2.2 GHz processor.

This is in part owing to the high-accuracy of robust SLAM algorithms and the emergence of new and lower-cost lidar products. This study benchmarks current state-of-the-art lidar SLAM algorithms with a multi-modal lidar sensor setup showcasing diverse scanning modalities (spinning and solid-state) and sensing technologies, and lidar cameras, mounted on a mobile sensing and computing platform. We extend our previous multi-modal multi-lidar dataset with additional sequences and new sources of ground truth data. Specifically, we propose a new multi-modal multi-lidar SLAM-assisted and ICP-based sensor fusion method for generating ground truth maps. With these maps, we then match real-time pointcloud data using a natural distribution transform (NDT) method to obtain the ground truth with full 6 DOF pose estimation. This novel ground truth data leverages high-resolution spinning and solid-state lidars. We also include new open road sequences with GNSS-RTK data and additional indoor sequences with motion capture (MOCAP) ground truth, complementing the previous forest sequences with MOCAP data. We perform an analysis of the positioning accuracy achieved with ten different SLAM algorithm and lidar combinations. We also report the resource utilization in four different computational platforms and a total of five settings (Intel and Jetson ARM CPUs). Our experimental results show that current state-of-the-art lidar SLAM algorithms perform very differently for different types of sensors.

| **[PlaneSLAM: Plane-based LiDAR SLAM for Motion Planning in Structured 3D Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08248v2)** | 2022-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR sensors are a powerful tool for robot simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) in unknown environments, but the raw point clouds they produce are dense, computationally expensive to store, and unsuited for direct use by downstream autonomy tasks, such as motion planning. For integration with motion planning, it is desirable for SLAM pipelines to generate lightweight geometric map representations. Such representations are also particularly well-suited for man-made environments, which can often be viewed as a so-called "Manhattan world" built on a Cartesian grid. In this work we present a 3D LiDAR SLAM algorithm for Manhattan world environments which extracts planar features from point clouds to achieve lightweight, real-time localization and mapping. Our approach generates plane-based maps which occupy significantly less memory than their point cloud equivalents, and are suited towards fast collision checking for motion planning. By leveraging the Manhattan world assumption, we target extraction of orthogonal planes to generate maps which are more structured and organized than those of existing plane-based LiDAR SLAM approaches. We demonstrate our approach in the high-fidelity AirSim simulator and in real-world experiments with a ground rover equipped with a Velodyne LiDAR. For both cases, we are able to generate high quality maps and trajectory estimates at a rate matching the sensor rate of 10 Hz.</p></details> |  |
| **[LMBAO: A Landmark Map for Bundle Adjustment Odometry in LiDAR SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08810v1)** | 2022-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR odometry is one of the essential parts of LiDAR simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). However, existing LiDAR odometry tends to match a new scan simply iteratively with previous fixed-pose scans, gradually accumulating errors. Furthermore, as an effective joint optimization mechanism, bundle adjustment (BA) cannot be directly introduced into real-time odometry due to the intensive computation of large-scale global landmarks. Therefore, this letter designs a new strategy named a landmark map for bundle adjustment odometry (LMBAO) in LiDAR SLAM to solve these problems. First, BA-based odometry is further developed with an active landmark maintenance strategy for a more accurate local registration and avoiding cumulative errors. Specifically, this paper keeps entire stable landmarks on the map instead of just their feature points in the sliding window and deletes the landmarks according to their active grade. Next, the sliding window length is reduced, and marginalization is performed to retain the scans outside the window but corresponding to active landmarks on the map, greatly simplifying the computation and improving the real-time properties. In addition, experiments on three challenging datasets show that our algorithm achieves real-time performance in outdoor driving and outperforms state-of-the-art LiDAR SLAM algorithms, including Lego-LOAM and VLOM.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 tables, 6 figures</p></details> |

While most of these SLAM systems use Visual and LiDAR sensors in tandem with an odometry sensor, these odometry sensors drift over time. To combat this drift, Visual SLAM systems deploy compute and memory intensive search algorithms to detect `Loop Closures', which make the trajectory estimate globally consistent. To circumvent these resource (compute and memory) intensive algorithms, we present ViWiD, which integrates WiFi and Visual sensors in a dual-layered system. This dual-layered approach separates the tasks of local and global trajectory estimation making ViWiD resource efficient while achieving on-par or better performance to state-of-the-art Visual SLAM. We demonstrate ViWiD's performance on four datasets, covering over 1500 m of traversed path and show 4.3x and 4x reduction in compute and memory consumption respectively compared to state-of-the-art Visual and Lidar SLAM systems with on par SLAM performance.</p></details> |  |

We propose a scheme that fuses map prior and vanishing points from images, which can establish an energy term that is only constrained on rotation, called the direction projection error. Then we embed these direction priors into a visual-LiDAR SLAM system that integrates camera and LiDAR measurements in a tightly-coupled way at backend. Specifically, our method generates visual reprojection error and point to Implicit Moving Least Square(IMLS) surface of scan constraints, and solves them jointly along with direction projection error at global optimization. Experiments on KITTI, KITTI-360 and Oxford Radar Robotcar show that we achieve lower localization error or Absolute Pose Error (APE) than prior map, which validates our method is effective.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages (including supplementary material), accepted by PRCV 2022</p></details> |

Fusing data from landmark sensors and a strap-down Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) in an adaptive Kalman filter (KF) plus the observability of the system are investigated. In addition to the vehicle's states and landmark positions, a self-tuning filter estimates the IMU calibration parameters as well as the covariance of the measurement noise. The discrete-time covariance matrix of the process noise, the state transition matrix, and the observation sensitivity matrix are derived in closed-form making them suitable for real-time implementation. Examining the observability of the 3D SLAM system leads to the conclusion that the system remains observable upon a geometrical condition on the alignment of the landmarks.</p></details> |  |

Etna, Sicily, an environment analogous to the Moon and Mars, using a hand-held sensor suite with attributes suitable for implementation on a space-like mobile rover. The environment is characterized by challenging conditions regarding both the visual and structural appearance: severe visual aliasing poses significant limitations to the ability of visual SLAM systems to perform place recognition, while the absence of outstanding structural details, joined with the limited Field-of-View of the utilized Solid-State LiDAR sensor, challenges traditional LiDAR SLAM for the task of pose estimation using point clouds alone. With this data, that covers more than 4 kilometers of travel on soft volcanic slopes, we aim to: 1) provide a tool to expose limitations of state-of-the-art SLAM systems with respect to environments, which are not present in widely available datasets and 2) motivate the development of novel localization and mapping approaches, that rely efficiently on the complementary capabilities of the two sensors.

The dataset includes data from two commercially available devices - a stereoscopic-inertial camera and a multi-beam 3D LiDAR, which also provides inertial measurements. Additionally, we used a tripod-mounted survey grade LiDAR scanner to capture a detailed millimeter-accurate 3D map of the test location (containing $\sim$290 million points). Using the map we inferred centimeter-accurate 6 Degree of Freedom (DoF) ground truth for the position of the device for each LiDAR scan to enable better evaluation of LiDAR and vision localisation, mapping and reconstruction systems. This ground truth is the particular novel contribution of this dataset and we believe that it will enable systematic evaluation which many similar datasets have lacked. The dataset combines both built environments, open spaces and vegetated areas so as to test localization and mapping systems such as vision-based navigation, visual and LiDAR SLAM, 3D LIDAR reconstruction and appearance-based place recognition.

However, most of the current lidar SLAM approaches are based on the assumption of a static environment. Hence the localization in a dynamic environment with multiple moving objects is actually unreliable. The paper proposes a dynamic SLAM framework RF-LIO, building on LIO-SAM, which adds adaptive multi-resolution range images and uses tightly-coupled lidar inertial odometry to first remove moving objects, and then match lidar scan to the submap. Thus, it can obtain accurate poses even in high dynamic environments. The proposed RF-LIO is evaluated on both self-collected datasets and open Urbanloco datasets. The experimental results in high dynamic environments demonstrate that, compared with LOAM and LIO-SAM, the absolute trajectory accuracy of the proposed RF-LIO can be improved by 90% and 70%, respectively. RF-LIO is one of the state-of-the-art SLAM systems in high dynamic environments.</p></details> |  |

However, LiDARs do not perform well in geometrically-degraded environments, due to the challenge of loop closure detection and computational load to perform scan matching. Existing WiFi infrastructure can be exploited for localization and mapping with low hardware and computational cost. Yet, accurate pose estimation using WiFi is challenging as different signal values can be measured at the same location due to the unpredictability of signal propagation. Therefore, we introduce the use of WiFi fingerprint sequence for pose estimation (i.e. loop closure) in SLAM. This approach exploits the spatial coherence of location fingerprints obtained while a mobile robot is moving. This has better capability of correcting odometry drift. The method also incorporates LiDAR scans and thus, improving computational efficiency for large and geometrically-degraded environments while maintaining the accuracy of LiDAR SLAM. We conducted experiments in an indoor environment to illustrate the effectiveness of the method. The results are evaluated based on Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and it has achieved an accuracy of 0.88m for the test environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by the 2022 IEEE 18th International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE)</p></details> |

In particular, ground-optimized LiDAR odometry usually employs ground segmentation as a preprocessing method. This is because most of the points in a 3D point cloud captured by a 3D LiDAR sensor on a terrestrial platform are from the ground. However, the effect of the performance of ground segmentation on LiDAR odometry is still not closely examined. In this paper, a robust ground-optimized LiDAR odometry framework is proposed to facilitate the study to check the effect of ground segmentation on LiDAR SLAM based on the state-of-the-art (SOTA) method. By using our proposed odometry framework, it is easy and straightforward to test whether ground segmentation algorithms help extract well-described features and thus improve SLAM performance. In addition, by leveraging the SOTA ground segmentation method called Patchwork, which shows robust ground segmentation even in complex and uneven urban environments with little performance perturbation, a novel ground-optimized LiDAR odometry is proposed, called PaGO-LOAM. The methods were tested using the KITTI odometry dataset. \textit{PaGO-LOAM} shows robust and accurate performance compared with the baseline method.

However, place recognition and geometric verification using these landmarks is challenging due to the requirement for global matching without an initial guess. Existing works typically only leverage either pole or plane landmarks, limiting application to a restricted set of environments. We present a global data association method for loop closure in lidar scans using 3D line and plane objects simultaneously and in a unified manner. The main novelty of this paper is in the representation of line and plane objects extracted from lidar scans on the manifold of affine subspaces, known as the affine Grassmannian. Line and plane correspondences are matched using our graph-based data association framework and subsequently registered in the least-squares sense. Compared to pole-only approaches and plane-only approaches, our 3D affine Grassmannian method yields a 71% and 325% increase respectively to loop closure recall at 100% precision on the KITTI dataset and can provide frame alignment with less than 10 cm and 1 deg of error.</p></details> |  |

Removing dynamic object is crucial in this situation but become tricky when ego-motion is coupled. In this paper, instead of proposing a new slam framework, we aim at a more general strategy for a localization scenario. In that case, Dynamic Registration is available for integrating with any lidar slam system. We utilize 3D object detection to obtain potential moving objects and remove them temporarily. Then we proposed Dynamic Registration, to iteratively estimate ego-motion and segment moving objects until no static object generates. Static objects are merged with the environment. Finally, we successfully segment dynamic objects, static environments with static objects, and ego-motion estimation in a dynamic environment. We evaluate the performance of our proposed method on KITTI Tracking datasets. Results show stable and consistent improvements based on other classical registration algorithms.</p></details> | submit to IV 2022 |

However, its mapping procedure is usually operated by a joystick in static environments, while indoor environments often are dynamic with moving objects such as people. The generated map with noisy points due to the dynamic objects is usually incomplete and distorted. To address this problem, we propose a framework of 2D-LiDAR-based SLAM without manual control that effectively excludes dynamic objects (people) and simplify the process for a robot to map an environment. The framework, which includes three parts: people tracking, filtering and following. We verify our proposed framework in experiments with two classic 2D-LiDAR-based SLAM algorithms in indoor environments. The results show that this framework is effective in handling dynamic objects and reducing the mapping error.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at 2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics (ROBIO)</p></details> |

The high-rate inertial data complement the other lower-rate modalities. Moreover, in the absence of constant acceleration, the gravity vector makes two attitude angles out of three observable in the global coordinate frame. In visual odometry, this is already being used to reduce the 6-Degrees Of Freedom (DOF) pose estimation problem to 4-DOF. In lidar SLAM, the gravity measurements are often used as a penalty in the back-end global map optimization to prevent map deformations. In this work, we propose an Iterative Closest Point (ICP)-based front-end which exploits the observable DOF and provides pose estimates aligned with the gravity vector. We believe that this front-end has the potential to support the loop closure identification, thus speeding up convergences of global map optimizations. The presented approach has been extensively tested in large-scale outdoor environments as well as in the Subterranean Challenge organized by Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). We show that it can reduce the localization drift by 30% when compared to the standard 6-DOF ICP. Moreover, the code is readily available to the community as a part of the libpointmatcher library.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

| **[DL-SLOT: Dynamic Lidar SLAM and Object Tracking Based On Graph Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.11431v1)** | 2022-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ego-pose estimation and dynamic object tracking are two key issues in an autonomous driving system. Two assumptions are often made for them, i.e. the static world assumption of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and the exact ego-pose assumption of object tracking, respectively. However, these assumptions are difficult to hold in highly dynamic road scenarios where SLAM and object tracking become correlated and mutually beneficial. In this paper, DL-SLOT, a dynamic Lidar SLAM and object tracking method is proposed. This method integrates the state estimations of both the ego vehicle and the static and dynamic objects in the environment into a unified optimization framework, to realize SLAM and object tracking (SLOT) simultaneously. Firstly, we implement object detection to remove all the points that belong to potential dynamic objects. Then, LiDAR odometry is conducted using the filtered point cloud. At the same time, detected objects are associated with the history object trajectories based on the time-series information in a sliding window. The states of the static and dynamic objects and ego vehicle in the sliding window are integrated into a unified local optimization framework. We perform SLAM and object tracking simultaneously in this framework, which significantly improves the robustness and accuracy of SLAM in highly dynamic road scenarios and the accuracy of objects' states estimation. Experiments on public datasets have shown that our method achieves better accuracy than A-LOAM.</p></details> |  |

Over the years, several deep learning approaches have been proposed to address this task, however their performance has been subpar compared to handcrafted techniques, especially while dealing with reverse loops. In this paper, we introduce the novel LCDNet that effectively detects loop closures in LiDAR point clouds by simultaneously identifying previously visited places and estimating the 6-DoF relative transformation between the current scan and the map. LCDNet is composed of a shared encoder, a place recognition head that extracts global descriptors, and a relative pose head that estimates the transformation between two point clouds. We introduce a novel relative pose head based on the unbalanced optimal transport theory that we implement in a differentiable manner to allow for end-to-end training. Extensive evaluations of LCDNet on multiple real-world autonomous driving datasets show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art loop closure detection and point cloud registration techniques by a large margin, especially while dealing with reverse loops. Moreover, we integrate our proposed loop closure detection approach into a LiDAR SLAM library to provide a complete mapping system and demonstrate the generalization ability using different sensor setup in an unseen city.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Robotics (T-RO), 2022</p></details> |
| **[SC-LiDAR-SLAM: a Front-end Agnostic Versatile LiDAR SLAM System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.06423v1)** | 2022-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate 3D point cloud map generation is a core task for various robot missions or even for data-driven urban analysis. To do so, light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensor-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) technology have been elaborated. To compose a full SLAM system, many odometry and place recognition methods have independently been proposed in academia. However, they have hardly been integrated or too tightly combined so that exchanging (upgrading) either single odometry or place recognition module is very effort demanding. Recently, the performance of each module has been improved a lot, so it is necessary to build a SLAM system that can effectively integrate them and easily replace them with the latest one. In this paper, we release such a front-end agnostic LiDAR SLAM system, named SC-LiDAR-SLAM. We built a complete SLAM system by designing it modular, and successfully integrating it with Scan Context++ and diverse existing opensource LiDAR odometry methods to generate an accurate point cloud map</p></details> |  |
| **[A Universal LiDAR SLAM Accelerator System on Low-cost FPGA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.09523v2)** | 2021-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) serves as a basis for indoor cleaning, navigation, and many other useful applications in both industry and household. From a series of LiDAR scans, it constructs an accurate, globally consistent model of the environment and estimates a robot position inside it. SLAM is inherently computationally intensive; it is a challenging problem to realize a fast and reliable SLAM system on mobile robots with a limited processing capability. To overcome such hurdles, in this paper, we propose a universal, low-power, and resource-efficient accelerator design for 2D LiDAR SLAM targeting resource-limited FPGAs. As scan matching is at the heart of SLAM, the proposed accelerator consists of dedicated scan matching cores on the programmable logic part, and provides software interfaces to facilitate the use. Our accelerator can be integrated to various SLAM methods including the ROS (Robot Operating System)-based ones, and users can switch to a different method without modifying and re-synthesizing the logic part. We integrate the accelerator into three widely-used methods, i.e., scan matching, particle filter, and graph-based SLAM. We evaluate the design in terms of resource utilization, speed, and quality of output results using real-world datasets. Experiment results on a Pynq-Z2 board demonstrate that our design accelerates scan matching and loop-closure detection tasks by up to 14.84x and 18.92x, yielding 4.67x, 4.00x, and 4.06x overall performance improvement in the above methods, respectively. Our design enables the real-time performance while consuming only 2.4W and maintaining accuracy, which is comparable to the software counterparts and even the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

To achieve such a comprehensive sensor fusion system, one has to tackle several challenges such as data synchronization, multi-threading programming, bundle adjustment (BA), and conflicting coordinate frames between UWB and the onboard sensors, so as to ensure real-time localization and smooth updates in the state estimates. To this end, we propose a two stage approach. In the first stage, lidar, camera, and IMU data on a local sliding window are processed in a core odometry thread. From this local graph, new key frames are evaluated for admission to a global map. Visual feature-based loop closure is also performed to supplement the global factor graph with loop constraints. When the global factor graph satisfies a condition on spatial diversity, the BA process will be triggered to update the coordinate transform between UWB and onboard SLAM systems. The system then seamlessly transitions to the second stage where all sensors are tightly integrated in the odometry thread. The capability of our system is demonstrated via several experiments on high-fidelity graphical-physical simulation and public datasets.</p></details> |  |

A single false-positive loop-closure can have a very negative impact on SLAM problems causing an inferior trajectory to be produced or even for the optimisation to fail entirely. To address this issue, popular existing approaches define a hard switch for each loop-closure constraint. This paper presents AEROS, a novel approach to adaptively solve a robust least-squares minimisation problem by adding just a single extra latent parameter. It can be used in the back-end component of the SLAM problem to enable generalised robust cost minimisation by simultaneously estimating the continuous latent parameter along with the set of sensor poses in a single joint optimisation. This leads to a very closely curve fitting on the distribution of the residuals, thereby reducing the effect of outliers. Additionally, we formulate the robust optimisation problem using standard Gaussian factors so that it can be solved by direct application of popular incremental estimation approaches such as iSAM. Experimental results on publicly available synthetic datasets and real LiDAR-SLAM datasets collected from the 2D and 3D LiDAR systems show the competitiveness of our approach with the state-of-the-art techniques and its superiority on real world scenarios.</p></details> | 13 |

Although some systems exist already, they are either not accurate or they struggle in real-time setting. In this paper, we propose a fast, accurate and modular LiDAR SLAM system for both batch and online estimation. We first apply downsampling and outlier removal, to filter out noise and reduce the size of the input point clouds. Filtered clouds are then used for pose tracking and floor detection, to ground-optimize the estimated trajectory. The availability of a pre-tracker, working in parallel with the filtering process, allows to obtain pre-computed odometries, to be used as aids when performing tracking. Efficient loop closure and pose optimization, achieved through a g2o pose graph, are the last steps of the proposed SLAM pipeline. We compare the performance of our system with state-of-the-art point cloud based methods, LOAM, LeGO-LOAM, A-LOAM, LeGO-LOAM-BOR and HDL, and show that the proposed system achieves equal or better accuracy and can easily handle even cases without loops.

Against the backdrop of more affordable 3D LiDAR sensors, research on 3D LiDAR SLAM is becoming increasingly popular. Furthermore, the re-localization problem with a point cloud map is the foundation for other SLAM applications. In this paper, a template matching framework is proposed to re-localize a robot globally in a 3D LiDAR map. This presents two main challenges. First, most global descriptors for point cloud can only be used for place detection under a small local area. Therefore, in order to re-localize globally in the map, point clouds and descriptors(templates) are densely collected using a reconstructed mesh model at an offline stage by a physical simulation engine to expand the functional distance of point cloud descriptors. Second, the increased number of collected templates makes the matching stage too slow to meet the real-time requirement, for which a cascade matching method is presented for better efficiency. In the experiments, the proposed framework achieves 0.2-meter accuracy at about 10Hz matching speed using pure python implementation with 100k templates, which is effective and efficient for SLAM applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Specifically, we propose a semantic-assisted ICP, including semantically matching, downsampling and plane constraint, and integrates a semantic graph-based place recognition method in our loop closure detection module. Benefitting from semantics, we can improve the localization accuracy, detect loop closures effectively, and construct a global consistent semantic map even in large-scale scenes. Extensive experiments on KITTI and Ford Campus dataset show that our system significantly improves baseline performance, has generalization ability to unseen data and achieves competitive results compared with state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages.

This is particularly useful in indoor environments where other localization technologies, such as GNSS, fail. Indoor spaces impose interesting challenges on visual localization algorithms: occlusions due to people, textureless surfaces, large viewpoint changes, low light, repetitive textures, etc. Existing indoor datasets are either comparably small or do only cover a subset of the mentioned challenges. In this paper, we introduce 5 new indoor datasets for visual localization in challenging real-world environments. They were captured in a large shopping mall and a large metro station in Seoul, South Korea, using a dedicated mapping platform consisting of 10 cameras and 2 laser scanners. In order to obtain accurate ground truth camera poses, we developed a robust LiDAR SLAM which provides initial poses that are then refined using a novel structure-from-motion based optimization. We present a benchmark of modern visual localization algorithms on these challenging datasets showing superior performance of structure-based methods using robust image features.

To this end, we propose MULLS, an efficient, low-drift, and versatile 3D LiDAR SLAM system. For the front-end, roughly classified feature points (ground, facade, pillar, beam, etc.) are extracted from each frame using dual-threshold ground filtering and principal components analysis. Then the registration between the current frame and the local submap is accomplished efficiently by the proposed multi-metric linear least square iterative closest point algorithm. Point-to-point (plane, line) error metrics within each point class are jointly optimized with a linear approximation to estimate the ego-motion. Static feature points of the registered frame are appended into the local map to keep it updated. For the back-end, hierarchical pose graph optimization is conducted among regularly stored history submaps to reduce the drift resulting from dead reckoning. Extensive experiments are carried out on three datasets with more than 100,000 frames collected by seven types of LiDAR on various outdoor and indoor scenarios. On the KITTI benchmark, MULLS ranks among the top LiDAR-only SLAM systems with real-time performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Codes...</summary><p>Codes: https://github.com/YuePanEdward/MULLS, Accepted by ICRA 2021</p></details> |

However, camera and LiDAR based SLAM systems can be fragile when facing challenging illumination or weather conditions which degrade their imagery and point cloud data. Radar, whose operating electromagnetic spectrum is less affected by environmental changes, is promising although its distinct sensing geometry and noise characteristics bring open challenges when being exploited for SLAM. % However, there are still open challenges since most existing visual and LiDAR SLAM systems do not operate in bad weathers. This paper studies the use of a Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave radar for SLAM in large-scale outdoor environments. We propose a full radar SLAM system, including a novel radar motion tracking algorithm that leverages radar geometry for reliable feature tracking. It also optimally compensates motion distortion and estimates pose by joint optimization. Its loop closure component is designed to be simple yet efficient for radar imagery by capturing and exploiting structural information of the surrounding environment. % while a scheme to reject ambiguous loop closure candidates is also designed specifically for radar. Extensive experiments on three public radar datasets, ranging from city streets and residential areas to countryside and highways, show competitive accuracy and reliability performance of the proposed radar SLAM system compared to the state-of-the-art LiDAR, vision and radar methods. The results show that our system is technically viable in achieving reliable SLAM in extreme weather conditions, e.g. heavy snow and dense fog, demonstrating the promising potential of using radar for all-weather localization and mapping.</p></details> | Under review |

To overcome this challenge and support the deployment of robots in real world scenarios, we propose a complete solution for a dynamic object aware LiDAR SLAM algorithm. This is achieved by leveraging a real-time capable neural network that can detect dynamic objects, thus allowing our system to deal with them explicitly. To efficiently generate the necessary training data which is key to our approach, we present a novel end-to-end occupancy grid based pipeline that can automatically label a wide variety of arbitrary dynamic objects. Our solution can thus generalize to different environments without the need for expensive manual labeling and at the same time avoids assumptions about the presence of a predefined set of known objects in the scene. Using this technique, we automatically label over 12000 LiDAR scans collected in an urban environment with a large amount of pedestrians and use this data to train a neural network, achieving an average segmentation IoU of 0.82. We show that explicitly dealing with dynamic objects can improve the LiDAR SLAM odometry performance by 39.6% while yielding maps which better represent the environments. A supplementary video as well as our test data are available online.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 11 figures, Accepted to the 2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA 2021)</p></details> |

However, they commonly have a high latency due to the expensive data association and nonlinear optimization. This paper demonstrates that actively selecting a subset of features significantly improves both the accuracy and efficiency of an L-SLAM system. We formulate the feature selection as a combinatorial optimization problem under a cardinality constraint to preserve the information matrix's spectral attributes. The stochastic-greedy algorithm is applied to approximate the optimal results in real-time. To avoid ill-conditioned estimation, we also propose a general strategy to evaluate the environment's degeneracy and modify the feature number online. The proposed feature selector is integrated into a multi-LiDAR SLAM system. We validate this enhanced system with extensive experiments covering various scenarios on two sensor setups and computation platforms. We show that our approach exhibits low localization error and speedup compared to the state-of-the-art L-SLAM systems.

To make a lightweight the algorithm, most SLAM systems rely on feature detection from images for vision SLAM or point cloud for laser-based methods. Feature detection through a 3D point cloud becomes a computationally challenging task. In this paper, we propose a feature detection method by projecting a 3D point cloud to form an image and apply the vision-based feature detection technique. The proposed method gives repeatable and stable features in a variety of environments. Based on such features, we build a 6-DOF SLAM system consisting of tracking, mapping, and loop closure threads. For loop detection, we employ a 2-step approach i.e. nearest key-frames detection and loop candidate verification by matching features extracted from rasterized LIDAR images. Furthermore, we utilize a key-frame structure to achieve a lightweight SLAM system. The proposed system is evaluated with implementation on the KITTI dataset and the University of Michigan Ford Campus dataset. Through experimental results, we show that the algorithm presented in this paper can substantially reduce the computational cost of feature detection from the point cloud and the whole SLAM system while giving accurate results.</p></details> |  |

Ground-SLAM is developed based on the well-known pose graph optimization framework. In the front-end, motion estimation is conducted using LiDAR Odometry (LO) with a novel sensor-centric sliding map introduced, which is maintained by filtering out expired features based on the model of error propagation. At each key-frame, the sliding map is recorded as a local map. The ground nearby is extracted and modelled as an infinite planar landmark in the form of Closest Point (CP) parameterization. Then, ground planes observed at different key-frames are associated, and the ground constraints are fused into the pose graph optimization framework to compress the pose drift of LO. Finally, loop-closure detection is carried out, and the residual error is jointly minimized, which could lead to a globally consistent map. Experimental results demonstrate superior performances in the accuracy of the proposed approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to conference IROS2021</p></details> |
| **[Lightweight 3-D Localization and Mapping for Solid-State LiDAR](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03800v2)** | 2021-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The LIght Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) sensor has become one of the most important perceptual devices due to its important role in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Existing SLAM methods are mainly developed for mechanical LiDAR sensors, which are often adopted by large scale robots. Recently, the solid-state LiDAR is introduced and becomes popular since it provides a cost-effective and lightweight solution for small scale robots. Compared to mechanical LiDAR, solid-state LiDAR sensors have higher update frequency and angular resolution, but also have smaller field of view (FoV), which is very challenging for existing LiDAR SLAM algorithms. Therefore, it is necessary to have a more robust and computationally efficient SLAM method for this new sensing device. To this end, we propose a new SLAM framework for solid-state LiDAR sensors, which involves feature extraction, odometry estimation, and probability map building. The proposed method is evaluated on a warehouse robot and a hand-held device. In the experiments, we demonstrate both the accuracy and efficiency of our method using an Intel L515 solid-state LiDAR. The results show that our method is able to provide precise localization and high quality mapping.

It is widely used in robotic applications such as autonomous driving and drone delivery. Traditional LiDAR-based SLAM algorithms mainly leverage the geometric features from the scene context, while the intensity information from LiDAR is ignored. Some recent deep-learning-based SLAM algorithms consider intensity features and train the pose estimation network in an end-to-end manner. However, they require significant data collection effort and their generalizability to environments other than the trained one remains unclear. In this paper we introduce intensity features to a SLAM system. And we propose a novel full SLAM framework that leverages both geometry and intensity features. The proposed SLAM involves both intensity-based front-end odometry estimation and intensity-based back-end optimization. Thorough experiments are performed including both outdoor autonomous driving and indoor warehouse robot manipulation. The results show that the proposed method outperforms existing geometric-only LiDAR SLAM methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters</p></details> |
| **[BALM: Bundle Adjustment for Lidar Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08215v2)** | 2021-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A local Bundle Adjustment (BA) on a sliding window of keyframes has been widely used in visual SLAM and proved to be very effective in lowering the drift. But in lidar SLAM, BA method is hardly used because the sparse feature points (e.g., edge and plane) make the exact point matching impossible. In this paper, we formulate the lidar BA as minimizing the distance from a feature point to its matched edge or plane. Unlike the visual SLAM (and prior plane adjustment method in lidar SLAM) where the feature has to be co-determined along with the pose, we show that the feature can be analytically solved and removed from the BA, the resultant BA is only dependent on the scan poses. This greatly reduces the optimization scale and allows large-scale dense plane and edge features to be used. To speedup the optimization, we derive the analytical derivatives of the cost function, up to second order, in closed form. Moreover, we propose a novel adaptive voxelization method to search feature correspondence efficiently. The proposed formulations are incorporated into a LOAM back-end for map refinement. Results show that, although as a back-end, the local BA can be solved very efficiently, even in real-time at 10Hz when optimizing 20 scans of point-cloud. The local BA also considerably lowers the LOAM drift. Our implementation of the BA optimization and LOAM are open-sourced to benefit the community.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 9 figures, conference</p></details> |

To attain high spatial and temporal fidelity in field conditions, we propose the application of continuous-time 3D SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping) to a spinning lidar payload (AgScan3D) mounted on a moving farm vehicle. The AgScan3D data is processed through a Continuous-Time SLAM algorithm into a globally registered 3D ray cloud. The global ray cloud is a canonical data format (a digital twin) from which we can compare vineyard snapshots over multiple times within a season and across seasons. Then, the vineyard rows are automatically extracted from the ray cloud and a novel density calculation is performed to estimate the maximum likelihood canopy densities of the vineyard. This combination of digital twinning, together with the accurate extraction of canopy structure information, allows entire vineyards to be analysed and compared, across the growing season and from year to year. The proposed method is evaluated both in simulation and field experiments. Field experiments were performed at four sites, which varied in vineyard structure and vine management, over two growing seasons and 64 data collection campaigns, resulting in a total traversal of 160 kilometres, 42.4 scanned hectares of vines with a combined total of approximately 93,000 scanned vines. Our experiments show canopy density repeatability of 3.8% (Relative RMSE) per vineyard panel, for acquisition speeds of 5-6 km/h, and under half the standard deviation in estimated densities when compared to an industry standard gap-fraction based solution.

However, LiDAR-SLAM suffers from accumulating errors which can be significantly mitigated by Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). Precise Point Positioning (PPP), an accurate GNSS operation mode independent of base stations, gains more popularity in unmanned systems. Considering the features of the two technologies, LiDAR-SLAM and PPP, this paper proposes a SLAM system, namely P3-LOAM (PPP based LiDAR Odometry and Mapping) which couples LiDAR-SLAM and PPP. For better integration, we derive LiDAR-SLAM positioning covariance by using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) Jacobian model, since SVD provides an explicit analytic solution of Iterative Closest Point (ICP), which is a key issue in LiDAR-SLAM. A novel method is then proposed to evaluate the estimated LiDAR-SLAM covariance. In addition, to increase the reliability of GNSS in urban canyon environment, we develop a LiDAR-SLAM assisted GNSS Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM) algorithm. Finally, we validate P$^3$-LOAM with UrbanNav, a challenging public dataset in urban canyon environment. Comprehensive test results prove that P3-LOAM outperforms benchmarks such as Single Point Positioning (SPP), PPP, LeGO-LOAM, SPP-LOAM, and loosely coupled navigation system proposed by the publisher of UrbanNav in terms of accuracy and availability.</p></details> |  |

In this paper we propose CamVox by adapting Livox lidars into visual SLAM (ORB-SLAM2) by exploring the lidars' unique features. Based on the non-repeating nature of Livox lidars, we propose an automatic lidar-camera calibration method that will work in uncontrolled scenes. The long depth detection range also benefit a more efficient mapping.

In this paper, we propose a resource-efficient FPGA implementation for accelerating scan matching computations, which typically cause a major bottleneck in 2D LiDAR SLAM methods. Scan matching is a process of correcting a robot pose by aligning the latest LiDAR measurements with an occupancy grid map, which encodes the information about the surrounding environment. We exploit an inherent parallelism in the Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filter (RBPF) based algorithms to perform scan matching computations for multiple particles in parallel. In the proposed design, several techniques are employed to reduce the resource utilization and to achieve the maximum throughput. Experimental results using the benchmark datasets show that the scan matching is accelerated by 5.31-8.75x and the overall throughput is improved by 3.72-5.10x without seriously degrading the quality of the final outputs. Furthermore, our proposed IP core requires only 44% of the total resources available in the TUL Pynq-Z2 FPGA board, thus facilitating the realization of SLAM applications on indoor mobile robots.</p></details> |  |

Satisfactory performance can be obtained using high-grade 3D LiDAR with 64 channels, which can provide dense point clouds. Unfortunately, the high price significantly prevents its extensive commercialization in ADV. The cost-effective 3D LiDAR with 16 channels is a promising replacement. However, only limited and sparse point clouds can be provided by the 16 channels LiDAR, which cannot guarantee sufficient positioning accuracy for ADV in challenging dynamic environments. The high-resolution image from the low-cost camera can provide ample information about the surroundings. However, the explicit depth information is not available from the image. Inspired by the complementariness of 3D LiDAR and camera, this paper proposes to make use of the high-resolution images from a camera to enrich the raw 3D point clouds from the low-cost 16 channels LiDAR based on a state-of-the-art deep learning algorithm. An ERFNet is firstly employed to segment the image with the aid of the raw sparse 3D point clouds. Meanwhile, the sparse convolutional neural network is employed to predict the dense point clouds based on raw sparse 3D point clouds. Then, the predicted dense point clouds are fused with the segmentation outputs from ERFnet using a novel multi-layer convolutional neural network to refine the predicted 3D point clouds. Finally, the enriched point clouds are employed to perform LiDAR SLAM based on the state-of-the-art normal distribution transform (NDT). We tested our approach on the re-edited KITTI datasets: (1)the sparse 3D point clouds are significantly enriched with a mean square error of 1.1m MSE. (2)the map generated from the LiDAR SLAM is denser which includes more details without significant accuracy loss.</p></details> |  |

Having the advantages of a map-centric approach, our method exhibits new features to overcome the shortcomings of existing systems, associated with multi-modal sensor fusion and LiDAR motion distortion. This is accomplished through the use of a local Continuous-Time (CT) trajectory representation. Also, our surface resolution preservative matching algorithm and Wishart-based surfel fusion model enables non-redundant yet dense mapping. Furthermore, we present a robust metric loop closure model to make the approach stable regardless of where the loop closure occurs.

We utilize spatial GP regression to model the environment. This tool enables us to recover surfaces including those in sparsely scanned areas and obtain uniform samples with uncertainty. Those properties facilitate robust data association and map updating in our scan-to-map registration scheme, especially when working with sparse range data. Compared with previous GP-SLAM, this work overcomes the prohibitive computational complexity of GP and redesigns the registration strategy to meet the accuracy requirements in 3D scenarios. For large-scale tasks, a two-thread framework is employed to suppress the drift further.

Point clouds are accumulated using an inertial-kinematic state estimator before being aligned using ICP registration. To close loops we use a loop proposal mechanism which matches individual segments between clouds. We trained a descriptor offline to match these segments. The efficiency of our method comes from carefully designing the network architecture to minimize the number of parameters such that this deep learning method can be deployed in real-time using only the CPU of a legged robot, a major contribution of this work. The set of odometry and loop closure factors are updated using pose graph optimization.

We use DNNs to model the highly non-convex mapping process that traditionally involves hand-crafted data association, sensor pose initialization, and global refinement. Our key novelty is that "training" these DNNs with properly defined unsupervised losses is equivalent to solving the underlying registration problem, but less sensitive to good initialization than ICP. Our framework contains two DNNs: a localization network that estimates the poses for input point clouds, and a map network that models the scene structure by estimating the occupancy status of global coordinates. This allows us to convert the registration problem to a binary occupancy classification, which can be solved efficiently using gradient-based optimization. We further show that DeepMapping can be readily extended to address the problem of Lidar SLAM by imposing geometric constraints between consecutive point clouds. Experiments are conducted on both simulated and real datasets. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons demonstrate that DeepMapping often enables more robust and accurate global registration of multiple point clouds than existing techniques.

| **[OpenLiDARMap: Zero-Drift Point Cloud Mapping using Map Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11111v1)** | 2025-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate localization is a critical component of mobile autonomous systems, especially in Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS)-denied environments where traditional methods fail. In such scenarios, environmental sensing is essential for reliable operation. However, approaches such as LiDAR odometry and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) suffer from drift over long distances, especially in the absence of loop closures. Map-based localization offers a robust alternative, but the challenge lies in creating and georeferencing maps without GNSS support. To address this issue, we propose a method for creating georeferenced maps without GNSS by using publicly available data, such as building footprints and surface models derived from sparse aerial scans. Our approach integrates these data with onboard LiDAR scans to produce dense, accurate, georeferenced 3D point cloud maps. By combining an Iterative Closest Point (ICP) scan-to-scan and scan-to-map matching strategy, we achieve high local consistency without suffering from long-term drift. Thus, we eliminate the reliance on GNSS for the creation of georeferenced maps. The results demonstrate that LiDAR-only mapping can produce accurate georeferenced point cloud maps when augmented with existing map priors.</p></details> |  |
| **[A flexible framework for accurate LiDAR odometry, map manipulation, and localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20465v2)** | 2024-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR-based SLAM is a core technology for autonomous vehicles and robots. One key contribution of this work to 3D LiDAR SLAM and localization is a fierce defense of view-based maps (pose graphs with time-stamped sensor readings) as the fundamental representation of maps. As will be shown, they allow for the greatest flexibility, enabling the posterior generation of arbitrary metric maps optimized for particular tasks, e.g. obstacle avoidance, real-time localization. Moreover, this work introduces a new framework in which mapping pipelines can be defined without coding, defining the connections of a network of reusable blocks much like deep-learning networks are designed by connecting layers of standardized elements. We also introduce tightly-coupled estimation of linear and angular velocity vectors within the Iterative Closest Point (ICP)-like optimizer, leading to superior robustness against aggressive motion profiles without the need for an IMU. Extensive experimental validation reveals that the proposal compares well to, or improves, former state-of-the-art (SOTA) LiDAR odometry systems, while also successfully mapping some hard sequences where others diverge. A proposed self-adaptive configuration has been used, without parameter changes, for all 3D LiDAR datasets with sensors between 16 and 128 rings, and has been extensively tested on 83 sequences over more than 250~km of automotive, hand-held, airborne, and quadruped LiDAR datasets, both indoors and outdoors. The system flexibility is demonstrated with additional configurations for 2D LiDARs and for building 3D NDT-like maps. The framework is open-sourced online: https://github.com/MOLAorg/mola</p></details> | 45 pages, 35 figures |
| **[UA-MPC: Uncertainty-Aware Model Predictive Control for Motorized LiDAR Odometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13873v1)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and comprehensive 3D sensing using LiDAR systems is crucial for various applications in photogrammetry and robotics, including facility inspection, Building Information Modeling (BIM), and robot navigation. Motorized LiDAR systems can expand the Field of View (FoV) without adding multiple scanners, but existing motorized LiDAR systems often rely on constant-speed motor control, leading to suboptimal performance in complex environments. To address this, we propose UA-MPC, an uncertainty-aware motor control strategy that balances scanning accuracy and efficiency. By predicting discrete observabilities of LiDAR Odometry (LO) through ray tracing and modeling their distribution with a surrogate function, UA-MPC efficiently optimizes motor speed control according to different scenes. Additionally, we develop a ROS-based realistic simulation environment for motorized LiDAR systems, enabling the evaluation of control strategies across diverse scenarios. Extensive experiments, conducted on both simulated and real-world scenarios, demonstrate that our method significantly improves odometry accuracy while preserving the scanning efficiency of motorized LiDAR systems. Specifically, it achieves over a 60\% reduction in positioning error with less than a 2\% decrease in efficiency compared to constant-speed control, offering a smarter and more effective solution for active 3D sensing tasks. The simulation environment for control motorized LiDAR is open-sourced at: \url{https://github.com/kafeiyin00/UA-MPC.git}.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Real-time Degeneracy Sensing and Compensation Method for Enhanced LiDAR SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07513v1)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR is widely used in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and autonomous driving. The LiDAR odometry is of great importance in multi-sensor fusion. However, in some unstructured environments, the point cloud registration cannot constrain the poses of the LiDAR due to its sparse geometric features, which leads to the degeneracy of multi-sensor fusion accuracy. To address this problem, we propose a novel real-time approach to sense and compensate for the degeneracy of LiDAR. Firstly, this paper introduces the degeneracy factor with clear meaning, which can measure the degeneracy of LiDAR. Then, the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) clustering method adaptively perceives the degeneracy with better environmental generalization. Finally, the degeneracy perception results are utilized to fuse LiDAR and IMU, thus effectively resisting degeneracy effects. Experiments on our dataset show the method's high accuracy and robustness and validate our algorithm's adaptability to different environments and LiDAR scanning modalities.</p></details> | 13 pages |
| **[Adaptive LiDAR Odometry and Mapping for Autonomous Agricultural Mobile Robots in Unmanned Farms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02899v1)** | 2024-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unmanned and intelligent agricultural systems are crucial for enhancing agricultural efficiency and for helping mitigate the effect of labor shortage. However, unlike urban environments, agricultural fields impose distinct and unique challenges on autonomous robotic systems, such as the unstructured and dynamic nature of the environment, the rough and uneven terrain, and the resulting non-smooth robot motion. To address these challenges, this work introduces an adaptive LiDAR odometry and mapping framework tailored for autonomous agricultural mobile robots operating in complex agricultural environments. The proposed framework consists of a robust LiDAR odometry algorithm based on dense Generalized-ICP scan matching, and an adaptive mapping module that considers motion stability and point cloud consistency for selective map updates. The key design principle of this framework is to prioritize the incremental consistency of the map by rejecting motion-distorted points and sparse dynamic objects, which in turn leads to high accuracy in odometry estimated from scan matching against the map. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated via extensive evaluation against state-of-the-art methods on field datasets collected in real-world agricultural environments featuring various planting types, terrain types, and robot motion profiles. Results demonstrate that our method can achieve accurate odometry estimation and mapping results consistently and robustly across diverse agricultural settings, whereas other methods are sensitive to abrupt robot motion and accumulated drift in unstructured environments. Further, the computational efficiency of our method is competitive compared with other methods. The source code of the developed method and the associated field dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/UCR-Robotics/AG-LOAM.</p></details> |  |
| **[LiDAR-based Registration against Georeferenced Models for Globally Consistent Allocentric Maps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02533v1)** | 2024-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are irreplaceable in search and rescue (SAR) missions to obtain a situational overview or provide closeups without endangering personnel. However, UAVs heavily rely on global navigation satellite system (GNSS) for localization which works well in open spaces, but the precision drastically degrades in the vicinity of buildings. These inaccuracies hinder aggregation of diverse data from multiple sources in a unified georeferenced frame for SAR operators. In contrast, CityGML models provide approximate building shapes with accurate georeferenced poses. Besides, LiDAR works best in the vicinity of 3D structures. Hence, we refine coarse GNSS measurements by registering LiDAR maps against CityGML and digital elevation map (DEM) models as a prior for allocentric mapping. An intuitive plausibility score selects the best hypothesis based on occupancy using a 2D height map. Afterwards, we integrate the registration results in a continuous-time spline-based pose graph optimizer with LiDAR odometry and further sensing modalities to obtain globally consistent, georeferenced trajectories and maps. We evaluate the viability of our approach on multiple flights captured at two distinct testing sites. Our method successfully reduced GNSS offset errors from up-to 16 m to below 0.5 m on multiple flights. Furthermore, we obtain globally consistent maps w.r.t. prior 3D geospatial models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at IEEE International Symposium on Safety, Security, and Rescue Robotics (SSRR), New York City, USA, November 2024</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Dynamic LiDAR Odometry for Mobile Robots with Structured Point Clouds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18443v1)** | 2024-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a real-time dynamic LiDAR odometry pipeline for mobile robots in Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) scenarios. Existing approaches to dynamic object detection often rely on pretrained learned networks or computationally expensive volumetric maps. To enhance efficiency on computationally limited robots, we reuse data between the odometry and detection module. Utilizing a range image segmentation technique and a novel residual-based heuristic, our method distinguishes dynamic from static objects before integrating them into the point cloud map. The approach demonstrates robust object tracking and improved map accuracy in environments with numerous dynamic objects. Even highly non-rigid objects, such as running humans, are accurately detected at point level without prior downsampling of the point cloud and hence, without loss of information. Evaluation on simulated and real-world data validates its computational efficiency. Compared to a state-of-the-art volumetric method, our approach shows comparable detection performance at a fraction of the processing time, adding only 14 ms to the odometry module for dynamic object detection and tracking. The implementation and a new real-world dataset are available as open-source for further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 2024 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)</p></details> |

However, a notable gap exists in evaluating datasets representing natural, unstructured environments such as forests or gardens. To address this, we present a study on localisation at the Australian Botanic Garden Mount Annan. This area encompasses open grassy areas, paved pathways, and densely vegetated sections with trees and other objects. The dataset was recorded using a 128-beam LiDAR sensor and GPS and IMU readings to track the ego-vehicle. This paper evaluates the performance of two state-of-the-art LiDARinertial odometry frameworks, COIN-LIO and LIO-SAM, on this dataset. We analyse trajectory estimates in both horizontal and vertical dimensions and assess relative translation and yaw errors over varying distances. Our findings reveal that while both frameworks perform adequately in the vertical plane, COINLIO demonstrates superior accuracy in the horizontal plane, particularly over extended trajectories. In contrast, LIO-SAM shows increased drift and yaw errors over longer distances.</p></details> | <details><summary>Redac...</summary><p>Redacted with respect to the Australian Conference on Robotics and Automoation 2024's writing criteria.

| **[GenZ-ICP: Generalizable and Degeneracy-Robust LiDAR Odometry Using an Adaptive Weighting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06766v1)** | 2024-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Light detection and ranging (LiDAR)-based odometry has been widely utilized for pose estimation due to its use of high-accuracy range measurements and immunity to ambient light conditions. However, the performance of LiDAR odometry varies depending on the environment and deteriorates in degenerative environments such as long corridors. This issue stems from the dependence on a single error metric, which has different strengths and weaknesses depending on the geometrical characteristics of the surroundings. To address these problems, this study proposes a novel iterative closest point (ICP) method called GenZ-ICP. We revisited both point-to-plane and point-to-point error metrics and propose a method that leverages their strengths in a complementary manner. Moreover, adaptability to diverse environments was enhanced by utilizing an adaptive weight that is adjusted based on the geometrical characteristics of the surroundings. As demonstrated in our experimental evaluation, the proposed GenZ-ICP exhibits high adaptability to various environments and resilience to optimization degradation in corridor-like degenerative scenarios by preventing ill-posed problems during the optimization process.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, Accepted to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)</p></details> |
| **[Automatic Target-Less Camera-LiDAR Calibration From Motion and Deep Point Correspondences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17298v3)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sensor setups of robotic platforms commonly include both camera and LiDAR as they provide complementary information. However, fusing these two modalities typically requires a highly accurate calibration between them. In this paper, we propose MDPCalib which is a novel method for camera-LiDAR calibration that requires neither human supervision nor any specific target objects. Instead, we utilize sensor motion estimates from visual and LiDAR odometry as well as deep learning-based 2D-pixel-to-3D-point correspondences that are obtained without in-domain retraining. We represent camera-LiDAR calibration as an optimization problem and minimize the costs induced by constraints from sensor motion and point correspondences. In extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our approach yields highly accurate extrinsic calibration parameters and is robust to random initialization. Additionally, our approach generalizes to a wide range of sensor setups, which we demonstrate by employing it on various robotic platforms including a self-driving perception car, a quadruped robot, and a UAV. To make our calibration method publicly accessible, we release the code on our project website at http://calibration.cs.uni-freiburg.de.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust High-Speed State Estimation for Off-road Navigation using Radar Velocity Factors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10953v2)** | 2024-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enabling robot autonomy in complex environments for mission critical application requires robust state estimation. Particularly under conditions where the exteroceptive sensors, which the navigation depends on, can be degraded by environmental challenges thus, leading to mission failure. It is precisely in such challenges where the potential for FMCW radar sensors is highlighted: as a complementary exteroceptive sensing modality with direct velocity measuring capabilities. In this work we integrate radial speed measurements from a FMCW radar sensor, using a radial speed factor, to provide linear velocity updates into a sliding-window state estimator for fusion with LiDAR pose and IMU measurements. We demonstrate that this augmentation increases the robustness of the state estimator to challenging conditions present in the environment and the negative effects they can pose to vulnerable exteroceptive modalities. The proposed method is extensively evaluated using robotic field experiments conducted using an autonomous, full-scale, off-road vehicle operating at high-speeds (~12 m/s) in complex desert environments. Furthermore, the robustness of the approach is demonstrated for cases of both simulated and real-world degradation of the LiDAR odometry performance along with comparison against state-of-the-art methods for radar-inertial odometry on public datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 9 figures.

| **[Robust Loop Closure by Textual Cues in Challenging Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15869v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Loop closure is an important task in robot navigation. However, existing methods mostly rely on some implicit or heuristic features of the environment, which can still fail to work in common environments such as corridors, tunnels, and warehouses. Indeed, navigating in such featureless, degenerative, and repetitive (FDR) environments would also pose a significant challenge even for humans, but explicit text cues in the surroundings often provide the best assistance. This inspires us to propose a multi-modal loop closure method based on explicit human-readable textual cues in FDR environments. Specifically, our approach first extracts scene text entities based on Optical Character Recognition (OCR), then creates a local map of text cues based on accurate LiDAR odometry and finally identifies loop closure events by a graph-theoretic scheme. Experiment results demonstrate that this approach has superior performance over existing methods that rely solely on visual and LiDAR sensors. To benefit the community, we release the source code and datasets at \url{https://github.com/TongxingJin/TXTLCD}.</p></details> |  |
| **[ATI-CTLO:Adaptive Temporal Interval-based Continuous-Time LiDAR-Only Odometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20619v3)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The motion distortion in LiDAR scans caused by aggressive robot motion and varying terrain features significantly impacts the positioning and mapping performance of 3D LiDAR odometry. Existing distortion correction solutions often struggle to balance computational complexity and accuracy. In this work, we propose an Adaptive Temporal Interval-based Continuous-Time LiDAR-only Odometry, utilizing straightforward and efficient linear interpolation. Our method flexibly adjusts the temporal intervals between control nodes according to the dynamics of motion and environmental characteristics. This adaptability enhances performance across various motion states and improves robustness in challenging, feature-sparse environments. We validate the effectiveness of our method on multiple datasets across different platforms, achieving accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art LiDAR-only odometry methods. Notably, in scenarios involving aggressive motion and sparse features, our method outperforms existing solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[DualQuat-LOAM: LiDAR Odometry and Mapping parametrized on Dual Quaternions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13541v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper reports on a novel method for LiDAR odometry estimation, which completely parameterizes the system with dual quaternions. To accomplish this, the features derived from the point cloud, including edges, surfaces, and Stable Triangle Descriptor (STD), along with the optimization problem, are expressed in the dual quaternion set. This approach enables the direct combination of translation and orientation errors via dual quaternion operations, greatly enhancing pose estimation, as demonstrated in comparative experiments against other state-of-the-art methods. Our approach reduced drift error compared to other LiDAR-only-odometry methods, especially in scenarios with sharp curves and aggressive movements with large angular displacement. DualQuat-LOAM is benchmarked against several public datasets. In the KITTI dataset it has a translation and rotation error of 0.79% and 0.0039{\deg}/m, with an average run time of 53 ms.</p></details> |  |
| **[TRLO: An Efficient LiDAR Odometry with 3D Dynamic Object Tracking and Removal](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13240v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simultaneous state estimation and mapping is an essential capability for mobile robots working in dynamic urban environment. The majority of existing SLAM solutions heavily rely on a primarily static assumption. However, due to the presence of moving vehicles and pedestrians, this assumption does not always hold, leading to localization accuracy decreased and maps distorted. To address this challenge, we propose TRLO, a dynamic LiDAR odometry that efficiently improves the accuracy of state estimation and generates a cleaner point cloud map. To efficiently detect dynamic objects in the surrounding environment, a deep learning-based method is applied, generating detection bounding boxes. We then design a 3D multi-object tracker based on Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) and nearest neighbor (NN) strategy to reliably identify and remove dynamic objects. Subsequently, a fast two-stage iterative nearest point solver is employed to solve the state estimation using cleaned static point cloud. Note that a novel hash-based keyframe database management is proposed for fast access to search keyframes. Furthermore, all the detected object bounding boxes are leveraged to impose posture consistency constraint to further refine the final state estimation. Extensive evaluations and ablation studies conducted on the KITTI and UrbanLoco datasets demonstrate that our approach not only achieves more accurate state estimation but also generates cleaner maps, compared with baselines.</p></details> | 8pages, 5figures |
| **[Kinematic-ICP: Enhancing LiDAR Odometry with Kinematic Constraints for Wheeled Mobile Robots Moving on Planar Surfaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10277v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR odometry is essential for many robotics applications, including 3D mapping, navigation, and simultaneous localization and mapping. LiDAR odometry systems are usually based on some form of point cloud registration to compute the ego-motion of a mobile robot. Yet, few of today's LiDAR odometry systems consider the domain-specific knowledge and the kinematic model of the mobile platform during the point cloud alignment. In this paper, we present Kinematic-ICP, a LiDAR odometry system that focuses on wheeled mobile robots equipped with a 3D LiDAR and moving on a planar surface, which is a common assumption for warehouses, offices, hospitals, etc. Our approach introduces kinematic constraints within the optimization of a traditional point-to-point iterative closest point scheme. In this way, the resulting motion follows the kinematic constraints of the platform, effectively exploiting the robot's wheel odometry and the 3D LiDAR observations. We dynamically adjust the influence of LiDAR measurements and wheel odometry in our optimization scheme, allowing the system to handle degenerate scenarios such as feature-poor corridors. We evaluate our approach on robots operating in large-scale warehouse environments, but also outdoors. The experiments show that our approach achieves top performances and is more accurate than wheel odometry and common LiDAR odometry systems. Kinematic-ICP has been recently deployed in the Dexory fleet of robots operating in warehouses worldwide at their customers' sites, showing that our method can run in the real world alongside a complete navigation stack.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICRA 2025</p></details> |
| **[C$^3$P-VoxelMap: Compact, Cumulative and Coalescible Probabilistic Voxel Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01195v2)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work presents a compact, cumulative and coalescible probabilistic voxel mapping method to enhance performance, accuracy and memory efficiency in LiDAR odometry. Probabilistic voxel mapping requires storing past point clouds and re-iterating on them to update the uncertainty every iteration, which consumes large memory space and CPU cycles. To solve this problem, we propose a two-folded strategy. First, we introduce a compact point-free representation for probabilistic voxels and derive a cumulative update of the planar uncertainty without caching original point clouds. Our voxel structure only keeps track of a predetermined set of statistics for points that lie inside it. This method reduces the runtime complexity from $O(MN)$ to $O(N)$ and the space complexity from $O(N)$ to $O(1)$ where $M$ is the number of iterations and $N$ is the number of points. Second, to further minimize memory usage and enhance mapping accuracy, we provide a strategy to dynamically merge voxels associated with the same physical planes by taking advantage of the geometric features in the real world. Rather than scanning for these coalescible voxels constantly at every iteration, our merging strategy accumulates voxels in a locality-sensitive hash and triggers merging lazily. On-demand merging not only reduces memory footprint with minimal computational overhead but also improves localization accuracy thanks to cross-voxel denoising. Experiments exhibit 20% higher accuracy, 20% faster performance and 70% lower memory consumption than the state-of-the-art.</p></details> |  |
| **[CELLmap: Enhancing LiDAR SLAM through Elastic and Lightweight Spherical Map Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19597v1)** | 2024-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>SLAM is a fundamental capability of unmanned systems, with LiDAR-based SLAM gaining widespread adoption due to its high precision. Current SLAM systems can achieve centimeter-level accuracy within a short period. However, there are still several challenges when dealing with largescale mapping tasks including significant storage requirements and difficulty of reusing the constructed maps. To address this, we first design an elastic and lightweight map representation called CELLmap, composed of several CELLs, each representing the local map at the corresponding location. Then, we design a general backend including CELL-based bidirectional registration module and loop closure detection module to improve global map consistency. Our experiments have demonstrated that CELLmap can represent the precise geometric structure of large-scale maps of KITTI dataset using only about 60 MB. Additionally, our general backend achieves up to a 26.88% improvement over various LiDAR odometry methods.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Enhancing the Reliability of LiDAR Point Cloud Sampling: A Colorization and Super-Resolution Approach Based on LiDAR-Generated Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11532v1)** | 2024-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology, a critical sensor in robotics and autonomous systems, has seen significant advancements. These improvements include enhanced resolution of point clouds and the capability to provide 360{\deg} low-resolution images. These images encode various data such as depth, reflectivity, and near-infrared light within the pixels. However, an excessive density of points and conventional point cloud sampling can be counterproductive, particularly in applications such as LiDAR odometry, where misleading points and degraded geometry information may induce drift errors. Currently, extensive research efforts are being directed towards leveraging LiDAR-generated images to improve situational awareness. This paper presents a comprehensive review of current deep learning (DL) techniques, including colorization and super-resolution, which are traditionally utilized in conventional computer vision tasks. These techniques are applied to LiDAR-generated images and are analyzed qualitatively. Based on this analysis, we have developed a novel approach that selectively integrates the most suited colorization and super-resolution methods with LiDAR imagery to sample reliable points from the LiDAR point cloud. This approach aims to not only improve the accuracy of point cloud registration but also avoid mismatching caused by lacking geometry information, thereby augmenting the utility and precision of LiDAR systems in practical applications. In our evaluation, the proposed approach demonstrates superior performance compared to our previous work, achieving lower translation and rotation errors with a reduced number of points.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[LiLoc: Lifelong Localization using Adaptive Submap Joining and Egocentric Factor Graph](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10172v1)** | 2024-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a versatile graph-based lifelong localization framework, LiLoc, which enhances its timeliness by maintaining a single central session while improves the accuracy through multi-modal factors between the central and subsidiary sessions. First, an adaptive submap joining strategy is employed to generate prior submaps (keyframes and poses) for the central session, and to provide priors for subsidiaries when constraints are needed for robust localization. Next, a coarse-to-fine pose initialization for subsidiary sessions is performed using vertical recognition and ICP refinement in the global coordinate frame. To elevate the accuracy of subsequent localization, we propose an egocentric factor graph (EFG) module that integrates the IMU preintegration, LiDAR odometry and scan match factors in a joint optimization manner. Specifically, the scan match factors are constructed by a novel propagation model that efficiently distributes the prior constrains as edges to the relevant prior pose nodes, weighted by noises based on keyframe registration errors. Additionally, the framework supports flexible switching between two modes: relocalization (RLM) and incremental localization (ILM) based on the proposed overlap-based mechanism to select or update the prior submaps from central session. The proposed LiLoc is tested on public and custom datasets, demonstrating accurate localization performance against state-of-the-art methods. Our codes will be publicly available on https://github.com/Yixin-F/LiLoc.</p></details> | conference |
| **[DSLO: Deep Sequence LiDAR Odometry Based on Inconsistent Spatio-temporal Propagation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00744v1)** | 2024-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a 3D point cloud sequence learning model based on inconsistent spatio-temporal propagation for LiDAR odometry, termed DSLO. It consists of a pyramid structure with a spatial information reuse strategy, a sequential pose initialization module, a gated hierarchical pose refinement module, and a temporal feature propagation module. First, spatial features are encoded using a point feature pyramid, with features reused in successive pose estimations to reduce computational overhead. Second, a sequential pose initialization method is introduced, leveraging the high-frequency sampling characteristic of LiDAR to initialize the LiDAR pose. Then, a gated hierarchical pose refinement mechanism refines poses from coarse to fine by selectively retaining or discarding motion information from different layers based on gate estimations. Finally, temporal feature propagation is proposed to incorporate the historical motion information from point cloud sequences, and address the spatial inconsistency issue when transmitting motion information embedded in point clouds between frames. Experimental results on the KITTI odometry dataset and Argoverse dataset demonstrate that DSLO outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving at least a 15.67\% improvement on RTE and a 12.64\% improvement on RRE, while also achieving a 34.69\% reduction in runtime compared to baseline methods.

Mesh maps represent a dense and continuous map format with low memory consumption, which can approximate complex structures with simple elements, attracting significant attention of researchers in recent years. However, most implementations operate under a static environment assumption. In effect, moving objects cause ghosting, potentially degrading the quality of meshing. To address these issues, we propose a plug-and-play meshing module adapting to dynamic environments, which can easily integrate with various LiDAR odometry to generally improve the pose estimation accuracy of odometry. In our meshing module, a novel two-stage coarse-to-fine dynamic removal method is designed to effectively filter dynamic objects, generating consistent, accurate, and dense mesh maps. To our best know, this is the first mesh construction method with explicit dynamic removal. Additionally, conducive to Gaussian process in mesh construction, sliding window-based keyframe aggregation and adaptive downsampling strategies are used to ensure the uniformity of point cloud. We evaluate the localization and mapping accuracy on five publicly available datasets. Both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate the superiority of our method compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms.

| **[CTE-MLO: Continuous-time and Efficient Multi-LiDAR Odometry with Localizability-aware Point Cloud Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04901v1)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, LiDAR-based localization and mapping methods have achieved significant progress thanks to their reliable and real-time localization capability. Considering single LiDAR odometry often faces hardware failures and degradation in practical scenarios, Multi-LiDAR Odometry (MLO), as an emerging technology, is studied to enhance the performance of LiDAR-based localization and mapping systems. However, MLO can suffer from high computational complexity introduced by dense point clouds that are fused from multiple LiDARs, and the continuous-time measurement characteristic is constantly neglected by existing LiDAR odometry. This motivates us to develop a Continuous-Time and Efficient MLO, namely CTE-MLO, which can achieve accurate and real-time state estimation using multi-LiDAR measurements through a continuous-time perspective. In this paper, the Gaussian process estimation is naturally combined with the Kalman filter, which enables each LiDAR point in a point stream to query the corresponding continuous-time trajectory within its time instants. A decentralized multi-LiDAR synchronization scheme also be devised to combine points from separate LiDARs into a single point cloud without the requirement for primary LiDAR assignment. Moreover, with the aim of improving the real-time performance of MLO without sacrificing robustness, a point cloud sampling strategy is designed with the consideration of localizability. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through various scenarios, including public datasets and real-world autonomous driving experiments. The results demonstrate that the proposed CTE-MLO can achieve high-accuracy continuous-time state estimations in real-time and is demonstratively competitive compared to other state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Sensors are often corrupted in those complicated and large-scale environments. This paper introduces GNSS-FGO, an online and global trajectory estimator that fuses GNSS observations alongside multiple sensor measurements for robust vehicle localization. In GNSS-FGO, we fuse asynchronous sensor measurements into the graph with a continuous-time trajectory representation using Gaussian process regression. This enables querying states at arbitrary timestamps so that sensor observations are fused without requiring strict state and measurement synchronization. Thus, the proposed method presents a generalized factor graph for multi-sensor fusion. To evaluate and study different GNSS fusion strategies, we fuse GNSS measurements in loose and tight coupling with a speed sensor, IMU, and lidar-odometry. We employed datasets from measurement campaigns in Aachen, Duesseldorf, and Cologne in experimental studies and presented comprehensive discussions on sensor observations, smoother types, and hyperparameter tuning. Our results show that the proposed approach enables robust trajectory estimation in dense urban areas, where the classic multi-sensor fusion method fails due to sensor degradation. In a test sequence containing a 17km route through Aachen, the proposed method results in a mean 2D positioning error of 0.48m while fusing raw GNSS observations with lidar odometry in a tight coupling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the IEEE Transactions on Robotics</p></details> |

However, it remains challenging to explore effective visual-LiDAR fusion, mainly due to the intrinsic data structure inconsistency between two modalities: Image pixels are regular and dense, but LiDAR points are unordered and sparse. To address the problem, we propose a local-to-global fusion network (DVLO) with bi-directional structure alignment. To obtain locally fused features, we project points onto the image plane as cluster centers and cluster image pixels around each center. Image pixels are pre-organized as pseudo points for image-to-point structure alignment. Then, we convert points to pseudo images by cylindrical projection (point-to-image structure alignment) and perform adaptive global feature fusion between point features and local fused features. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on KITTI odometry and FlyingThings3D scene flow datasets compared to both single-modal and multi-modal methods.

Traditional methods for dynamic object detection rely on high accuracy odometry and maps to detect and track moving objects. However, these methods are not suitable for long-term operation in dynamic environments where the surrounding environment is constantly changing. In order to solve this problem, we propose a novel system for detecting and tracking dynamic objects in real-time using only LiDAR data. By emphasizing the extraction of low-frequency components from LiDAR data as feature points for foreground objects, our method significantly reduces the time required for object clustering and movement analysis. Additionally, we have developed a tracking approach that employs intensity-based ego-motion estimation along with a sliding window technique to assess object movements. This enables the precise identification of moving objects and enhances the system's resilience to odometry drift. Our experiments show that this system can detect and track dynamic objects in real-time with an average detection accuracy of 88.7\% and a recall rate of 89.1\%. Furthermore, our system demonstrates resilience against the prolonged drift typically associated with front-end only LiDAR odometry.

However, most of the current works focus on nonlinear optimization methods, and still existing many challenges in using the traditional Iterative Extended Kalman Filter (IEKF) framework to tackle the problem: IEKF only iterates over the observation equation, relying on a rough estimate of the initial state, which is insufficient to fully eliminate motion distortion in the input point cloud; the system process noise is difficult to be determined during state estimation of the complex motions; and the varying motion models across different sensor carriers. To address these issues, we propose the Dual-Iteration Extended Kalman Filter (I2EKF) and the LiDAR odometry based on I2EKF (I2EKF-LO). This approach not only iterates over the observation equation but also leverages state updates to iteratively mitigate motion distortion in LiDAR point clouds. Moreover, it dynamically adjusts process noise based on the confidence level of prior predictions during state estimation and establishes motion models for different sensor carriers to achieve accurate and efficient state estimation. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that I2EKF-LO achieves outstanding levels of accuracy and computational efficiency in the realm of LiDAR odometry. Additionally, to foster community development, our code is open-sourced.https://github.com/YWL0720/I2EKF-LO.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IROS 2024</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose a SLAM system for building globally consistent maps, called PIN-SLAM, that is based on an elastic and compact point-based implicit neural map representation. Taking range measurements as input, our approach alternates between incremental learning of the local implicit signed distance field and the pose estimation given the current local map using a correspondence-free, point-to-implicit model registration. Our implicit map is based on sparse optimizable neural points, which are inherently elastic and deformable with the global pose adjustment when closing a loop. Loops are also detected using the neural point features. Extensive experiments validate that PIN-SLAM is robust to various environments and versatile to different range sensors such as LiDAR and RGB-D cameras. PIN-SLAM achieves pose estimation accuracy better or on par with the state-of-the-art LiDAR odometry or SLAM systems and outperforms the recent neural implicit SLAM approaches while maintaining a more consistent, and highly compact implicit map that can be reconstructed as accurate and complete meshes. Finally, thanks to the voxel hashing for efficient neural points indexing and the fast implicit map-based registration without closest point association, PIN-SLAM can run at the sensor frame rate on a moderate GPU. Codes will be available at: https://github.com/PRBonn/PIN_SLAM.</p></details> | 20 pages |
| **[Attention-Guided Lidar Segmentation and Odometry Using Image-to-Point Cloud Saliency Transfer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14332v2)** | 2024-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR odometry estimation and 3D semantic segmentation are crucial for autonomous driving, which has achieved remarkable advances recently. However, these tasks are challenging due to the imbalance of points in different semantic categories for 3D semantic segmentation and the influence of dynamic objects for LiDAR odometry estimation, which increases the importance of using representative/salient landmarks as reference points for robust feature learning. To address these challenges, we propose a saliency-guided approach that leverages attention information to improve the performance of LiDAR odometry estimation and semantic segmentation models. Unlike in the image domain, only a few studies have addressed point cloud saliency information due to the lack of annotated training data. To alleviate this, we first present a universal framework to transfer saliency distribution knowledge from color images to point clouds, and use this to construct a pseudo-saliency dataset (i.e. FordSaliency) for point clouds. Then, we adopt point cloud-based backbones to learn saliency distribution from pseudo-saliency labels, which is followed by our proposed SalLiDAR module. SalLiDAR is a saliency-guided 3D semantic segmentation model that integrates saliency information to improve segmentation performance. Finally, we introduce SalLONet, a self-supervised saliency-guided LiDAR odometry network that uses the semantic and saliency predictions of SalLiDAR to achieve better odometry estimation. Our extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed SalLiDAR and SalLONet models achieve state-of-the-art performance against existing methods, highlighting the effectiveness of image-to-LiDAR saliency knowledge transfer.

Notably, existing calibration methods derive calibration parameters under the assumption that the methods require full motion in all axes. When IMU and LiDAR are mounted on a ground robot the motion of which is restricted to planar motion, existing calibration methods are likely to exhibit degraded performance. To address this issue, we present GRIL-Calib: a novel targetless Ground Robot IMU-LiDAR Calibration method. Our proposed method leverages ground information to compensate for the lack of unrestricted full motion. First, we propose LiDAR Odometry (LO) using ground plane residuals to enhance calibration accuracy. Second, we propose the Ground Plane Motion (GPM) constraint and incorporate it into the optimization for calibration, enabling the determination of full 6-DoF extrinsic parameters, including theoretically unobservable direction. Finally, unlike baseline methods, we formulate the calibration not as sequential two optimizations but as a single optimization (SO) problem, solving all calibration parameters simultaneously and improving accuracy. We validate our GRIL-Calib by applying it to various real-world datasets and comparing its performance with that of existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and robustness.

This problem has been addressed by the community for more than two decades, and many effective solutions are available nowadays. Most of these systems implicitly rely on assumptions about the operating environment, the sensor used, and motion pattern. When these assumptions are violated, several well-known systems tend to perform poorly. This paper presents a LiDAR odometry system that can overcome these limitations and operate well under different operating conditions while achieving performance comparable with domain-specific methods. Our algorithm follows the well-known ICP paradigm that leverages a PCA-based kd-tree implementation that is used to extract structural information about the clouds being registered and to compute the minimization metric for the alignment. The drift is bound by managing the local map based on the estimated uncertainty of the tracked pose. To benefit the community, we release an open-source C++ anytime real-time implementation.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/rvp-group/mad-icp</p></details> |

Understanding the semantics of the surrounding environment and accurate vehicle pose estimation are essential capabilities for autonomous vehicles, including self-driving cars and mobile robots that perform complex tasks. Fast moving platforms like self-driving cars impose a hard challenge for localization and mapping algorithms. In this work, we propose a novel framework for real-time LiDAR odometry and mapping based on LOAM architecture for fast moving platforms. Our framework utilizes semantic information produced by a deep learning model to improve point-to-line and point-to-plane matching between LiDAR scans and build a semantic map of the environment, leading to more accurate motion estimation using LiDAR data. We observe that including semantic information in the matching process introduces a new type of outlier matches to the process, where matching occur between different objects of the same semantic class. To this end, we propose a novel algorithm that explicitly identifies and discards potential outliers in the matching process. In our experiments, we study the effect of improving the matching process on the robustness of LiDAR odometry against high speed motion. Our experimental evaluations on KITTI dataset demonstrate that utilizing semantic information and rejecting outliers significantly enhance the robustness of LiDAR odometry and mapping when there are large gaps between scan acquisition poses, which is typical for fast moving platforms.</p></details> |  |

In the existing works, iterative closest point (ICP) is widely used since it is precise and efficient. Due to its non-convexity and its local iterative strategy, however, ICP-based method easily falls into local optima, which in turn calls for a precise initialization. In this paper, we propose CoFi, a Coarse-to-Fine ICP algorithm for LiDAR localization. Specifically, the proposed algorithm down-samples the input point sets under multiple voxel resolution, and gradually refines the transformation from the coarse point sets to the fine-grained point sets. In addition, we propose a map based LiDAR localization algorithm that extracts semantic feature points from the LiDAR frames and apply CoFi to estimate the pose on an efficient point cloud map. With the help of the Cylinder3D algorithm for LiDAR scan semantic segmentation, the proposed CoFi localization algorithm demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance on the KITTI odometry benchmark, with significant improvement over the literature.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revis...</summary><p>Revise to new article</p></details> |

To address the issue of LiDAR odometry drift in high-noise settings, integrating clustering methods to filter out unstable features has become an effective module of SLAM frameworks. However, reducing the amount of point cloud data can lead to potential loss of information and possible degeneration. As a result, this research proposes a LiDAR odometry that can dynamically assess the point cloud's reliability. The algorithm aims to improve adaptability in diverse settings by selecting important feature points with sensitivity to the level of environmental degeneration. Firstly, a fast adaptive Euclidean clustering algorithm based on range image is proposed, which, combined with depth clustering, extracts the primary structural points of the environment defined as ambient skeleton points. Then, the environmental degeneration level is computed through the dense normal features of the skeleton points, and the point cloud cleaning is dynamically adjusted accordingly. The algorithm is validated on the KITTI benchmark and real environments, demonstrating higher accuracy and robustness in different environments.</p></details> |  |

Lidar scan matching, which is used in dead reckoning (also known as lidar odometry) and mapping, computes the rotation and translation that best align a pair of point clouds. Perspective errors occur when a scene is viewed from different angles, with different surfaces becoming visible or occluded from each viewpoint. To explain perspective anomalies observed in data, this paper models perspective errors for two objects representative of urban landscapes: a cylindrical column and a dual-wall corner. For each object, we provide an analytical model of the perspective error for voxel-based lidar scan matching. We then analyze how perspective errors accumulate as a lidar-equipped vehicle moves past these objects.</p></details> |  |
| **[LinK3D: Linear Keypoints Representation for 3D LiDAR Point Cloud](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.05927v3)** | 2024-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Feature extraction and matching are the basic parts of many robotic vision tasks, such as 2D or 3D object detection, recognition, and registration. As is known, 2D feature extraction and matching have already achieved great success. Unfortunately, in the field of 3D, the current methods may fail to support the extensive application of 3D LiDAR sensors in robotic vision tasks due to their poor descriptiveness and inefficiency. To address this limitation, we propose a novel 3D feature representation method: Linear Keypoints representation for 3D LiDAR point cloud, called LinK3D. The novelty of LinK3D lies in that it fully considers the characteristics (such as the sparsity and complexity) of LiDAR point clouds and represents the keypoint with its robust neighbor keypoints, which provide strong constraints in the description of the keypoint. The proposed LinK3D has been evaluated on three public datasets, and the experimental results show that our method achieves great matching performance. More importantly, LinK3D also shows excellent real-time performance, faster than the sensor frame rate at 10 Hz of a typical rotating LiDAR sensor. LinK3D only takes an average of 30 milliseconds to extract features from the point cloud collected by a 64-beam LiDAR and takes merely about 20 milliseconds to match two LiDAR scans when executed on a computer with an Intel Core i7 processor. Moreover, our method can be extended to LiDAR odometry task, and shows good scalability. We release the implementation of our method at https://github.com/YungeCui/LinK3D.</p></details> |  |

The main goal of odometry is to predict the robot's motion and accurately determine its current location.

LiDAR, in particular, has gained attention for its ability to provide rich three-dimensional (3D) data and immunity to light variations. This survey aims to examine advancements in LiDAR odometry thoroughly. We start by exploring LiDAR technology and then scrutinize LiDAR odometry works, categorizing them based on their sensor integration approaches. These approaches include methods relying solely on LiDAR, those combining LiDAR with IMU, strategies involving multiple LiDARs, and methods fusing LiDAR with other sensor modalities. In conclusion, we address existing challenges and outline potential future directions in LiDAR odometry. Additionally, we analyze public datasets and evaluation methods for LiDAR odometry.

In this study, we propose a novel LiDAR odometry which effectively utilizes the overall exterior characteristics of environmental landmarks. The vehicle pose estimation is accomplished by means of two sequential pose estimation stages, namely, horizontal pose estimation and vertical pose estimation. To achieve effective landmark registration, a comprehensive index is proposed to evaluate the level of similarity between landmarks. This index takes into account two crucial aspects of landmarks, namely, dimension and shape in evaluating their similarity. To assess the performance of the proposed algorithm, we utilize the widely recognized KITTI dataset as well as experimental data collected by an unmanned ground vehicle platform. Both graphical and numerical results indicate that our algorithm outperforms leading LiDAR odometry solutions in terms of positioning accuracy.</p></details> |  |

They are usually sensitive to noise. To overcome these limitations, we propose a real-time mesh-based LiDAR odometry and mapping approach for large-scale scenes via implicit reconstruction and a parallel spatial-hashing scheme. To efficiently reconstruct triangular meshes, we suggest an incremental voxel meshing method that updates every scan by traversing each point once and compresses space via a scalable partition module. By taking advantage of rapid accessing triangular meshes at any time, we design point-to-mesh odometry with location and feature-based data association to estimate the poses between the incoming point clouds and the recovered triangular meshes. The experimental results on four datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach in generating accurate motion trajectories and environmental mesh maps.</p></details> |  |
| **[Versatile LiDAR-Inertial Odometry With SE (2) Constraints for Ground Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01584v1)** | 2023-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR SLAM has become one of the major localization systems for ground vehicles since LiDAR Odometry And Mapping (LOAM). Many extension works on LOAM mainly leverage one specific constraint to improve the performance, e.g., information from on-board sensors such as loop closure and inertial state; prior conditions such as ground level and motion dynamics. In many robotic applications, these conditions are often known partially, hence a SLAM system can be a comprehensive problem due to the existence of numerous constraints. Therefore, we can achieve a better SLAM result by fusing them properly. In this paper, we propose a hybrid LiDAR-inertial SLAM framework that leverages both the on-board perception system and prior information such as motion dynamics to improve localization performance. In particular, we consider the case for ground vehicles, which are commonly used for autonomous driving and warehouse logistics. We present a computationally efficient LiDAR-inertial odometry method that directly parameterizes ground vehicle poses on SE(2). The out-of-SE(2) motion perturbations are not neglected but incorporated into an integrated noise term of a novel SE(2)-constraints model. For odometric measurement processing, we propose a versatile, tightly coupled LiDAR-inertial odometry to achieve better pose estimation than traditional LiDAR odometry. Thorough experiments are performed to evaluate our proposed method's performance in different scenarios, including localization for both indoor and outdoor environments. The proposed method achieves superior performance in accuracy and robustness.</p></details> |  |

This substantially reduces computation time and the required features for odometry estimation in LOAM-based algorithms. Our odometry estimation method does not rely on global maps or loop closure algorithms, which further reduces computational costs. Experimental results generate a translation and rotation error of 0.86\% and 0.0036{\deg}/m on the KITTI dataset with an average runtime of 78ms.

However, there are several challenges for these new LiDAR sensors, including small field of view, severe motion distortions, and irregular patterns, which hinder them from being widely used in LiDAR odometry, practically. To tackle these problems, we present an effective continuous-time LiDAR odometry (ECTLO) method for the Risley-prism-based LiDARs with non-repetitive scanning patterns. A single range image covering historical points in LiDAR's small FoV is adopted for efficient map representation. To account for the noisy data from occlusions after map updating, a filter-based point-to-plane Gaussian Mixture Model is used for robust registration. Moreover, a LiDAR-only continuous-time motion model is employed to relieve the inevitable distortions. Extensive experiments have been conducted on various testbeds using the prism-based LiDARs with different scanning patterns, whose promising results demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures.

In this article, we propose a novel approach to improve the accuracy of visual localization using Structure from Motion (SfM) techniques. We highlight the limitations of global SfM, which suffers from high latency, and the challenges of local SfM, which requires large image databases for accurate reconstruction. To address these issues, we propose utilizing Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), as opposed to image databases, to cut down on the space required for storage. We suggest that sampling reference images around the prior query position can lead to further improvements. We evaluate the accuracy of our proposed method against ground truth obtained using LIDAR and Advanced Lidar Odometry and Mapping in Real-time (A-LOAM), and compare its storage usage against local SfM with COLMAP in the conducted experiments. Our proposed method achieves an accuracy of 0.068 meters compared to the ground truth, which is slightly lower than the most advanced method COLMAP, which has an accuracy of 0.022 meters. However, the size of the database required for COLMAP is 400 megabytes, whereas the size of our NeRF model is only 160 megabytes. Finally, we perform an ablation study to assess the impact of using reference images from the NeRF reconstruction.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we consider achieving a reliable LiDAR-based SLAM function in computation-limited platforms, such as quadrotor UAVs based on graph-based point cloud association. First, contrary to most works selecting salient features for point cloud registration, we propose a non-conspicuous feature selection strategy for reliability and robustness purposes. Then a two-stage correspondence selection method is used to register the point cloud, which includes a KD-tree-based coarse matching followed by a graph-based matching method that uses geometric consistency to vote out incorrect correspondences. Additionally, we propose an odometry approach where the weight optimizations are guided by vote results from the aforementioned geometric consistency graph. In this way, the optimization of LiDAR odometry rapidly converges and evaluates a fairly accurate transformation resulting in the back-end module efficiently finishing the mapping task. Finally, we evaluate our proposed framework on the KITTI odometry dataset and real-world environments. Experiments show that our SLAM system achieves a comparative level or higher level of accuracy with more balanced computation efficiency compared with the mainstream LiDAR-based SLAM solutions.</p></details> |  |

Existing learning-based 3D descriptors and keypoint detectors are either independent or loosely coupled, so they cannot fully adapt to each other. In this work, we propose a tightly coupled keypoint detector and descriptor (TCKDD) based on a multi-task fully convolutional network with a probabilistic detection loss. In particular, this self-supervised detection loss fully adapts the keypoint detector to any jointly learned descriptors and benefits the self-supervised learning of descriptors. Extensive experiments on both indoor and outdoor datasets show that our TCKDD achieves state-of-the-art performance in point cloud registration. Furthermore, we design a keypoint detector and descriptors-assisted LiDAR odometry and mapping framework (KDD-LOAM), whose real-time odometry relies on keypoint descriptor matching-based RANSAC. The sparse keypoints are further used for efficient scan-to-map registration and mapping. Experiments on KITTI dataset demonstrate that KDD-LOAM significantly surpasses LOAM and shows competitive performance in odometry.</p></details> |  |

Unlike the mainstreamed approaches that focus on improving the accuracy by the additional inertial sensors, this letter explores the capability of LiDAR-only odometry through a continuous-time perspective. Firstly, the measurements of LiDAR are regarded as streaming points continuously captured at high frequency. Secondly, the LiDAR movement is parameterized by a simple yet effective continuous-time trajectory. Therefore, our proposed Traj-LO approach tries to recover the spatial-temporal consistent movement of LiDAR by tightly coupling the geometric information from LiDAR points and kinematic constraints from trajectory smoothness. This framework is generalized for different kinds of LiDAR as well as multi-LiDAR systems. Extensive experiments on the public datasets demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of our proposed LiDAR-only approach, even in scenarios where the kinematic state exceeds the IMU's measuring range. Our implementation is open-sourced on GitHub.</p></details> | <details><summary>Video...</summary><p>Video https://youtu.be/hbtKzElYKkQ?si=3KEVy0hlHBsKV8j0 and Project site https://github.com/kevin2431/Traj-LO</p></details> |
| **[LiDAR-Generated Images Derived Keypoints Assisted Point Cloud Registration Scheme in Odometry Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10436v1)** | 2023-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Keypoint detection and description play a pivotal role in various robotics and autonomous applications including visual odometry (VO), visual navigation, and Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). While a myriad of keypoint detectors and descriptors have been extensively studied in conventional camera images, the effectiveness of these techniques in the context of LiDAR-generated images, i.e. reflectivity and ranges images, has not been assessed. These images have gained attention due to their resilience in adverse conditions such as rain or fog. Additionally, they contain significant textural information that supplements the geometric information provided by LiDAR point clouds in the point cloud registration phase, especially when reliant solely on LiDAR sensors. This addresses the challenge of drift encountered in LiDAR Odometry (LO) within geometrically identical scenarios or where not all the raw point cloud is informative and may even be misleading. This paper aims to analyze the applicability of conventional image key point extractors and descriptors on LiDAR-generated images via a comprehensive quantitative investigation. Moreover, we propose a novel approach to enhance the robustness and reliability of LO. After extracting key points, we proceed to downsample the point cloud, subsequently integrating it into the point cloud registration phase for the purpose of odometry estimation. Our experiment demonstrates that the proposed approach has comparable accuracy but reduced computational overhead, higher odometry publishing rate, and even superior performance in scenarios prone to drift by using the raw point cloud. This, in turn, lays a foundation for subsequent investigations into the integration of LiDAR-generated images with LO.

In this paper, we propose onlineFGO, a novel time-centric graph-optimization-based localization method that fuses multiple sensor measurements with the continuous-time trajectory representation for vehicle localization tasks. We generalize the graph construction independent of any spatial sensor measurements by creating the states deterministically on time. As the trajectory representation in continuous-time enables querying states at arbitrary times, incoming sensor measurements can be factorized on the graph without requiring state alignment. We integrate different GNSS observations: pseudorange, deltarange, and time-differenced carrier phase (TDCP) to ensure global reference and fuse the relative motion from a LiDAR-odometry to improve the localization consistency while GNSS observations are not available. Experiments on general performance, effects of different factors, and hyper-parameter settings are conducted in a real-world measurement campaign in Aachen city that contains different urban scenarios. Our results show an average 2D error of 0.99m and consistent state estimation in urban scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>A maj...</summary><p>A major revision of this paper is available, which will be submitted to arXiv later</p></details> |
| **[A LiDAR-Inertial SLAM Tightly-Coupled with Dropout-Tolerant GNSS Fusion for Autonomous Mine Service Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11492v1)** | 2023-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-modal sensor integration has become a crucial prerequisite for the real-world navigation systems. Recent studies have reported successful deployment of such system in many fields. However, it is still challenging for navigation tasks in mine scenes due to satellite signal dropouts, degraded perception, and observation degeneracy. To solve this problem, we propose a LiDAR-inertial odometry method in this paper, utilizing both Kalman filter and graph optimization. The front-end consists of multiple parallel running LiDAR-inertial odometries, where the laser points, IMU, and wheel odometer information are tightly fused in an error-state Kalman filter. Instead of the commonly used feature points, we employ surface elements for registration. The back-end construct a pose graph and jointly optimize the pose estimation results from inertial, LiDAR odometry, and global navigation satellite system (GNSS). Since the vehicle has a long operation time inside the tunnel, the largely accumulated drift may be not fully by the GNSS measurements. We hereby leverage a loop closure based re-initialization process to achieve full alignment. In addition, the system robustness is improved through handling data loss, stream consistency, and estimation error. The experimental results show that our system has a good tolerance to the long-period degeneracy with the cooperation different LiDARs and surfel registration, achieving meter-level accuracy even for tens of minutes running during GNSS dropouts.</p></details> |  |
| **[DELO: Deep Evidential LiDAR Odometry using Partial Optimal Transport](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07153v1)** | 2023-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate, robust, and real-time LiDAR-based odometry (LO) is imperative for many applications like robot navigation, globally consistent 3D scene map reconstruction, or safe motion-planning. Though LiDAR sensor is known for its precise range measurement, the non-uniform and uncertain point sampling density induce structural inconsistencies. Hence, existing supervised and unsupervised point set registration methods fail to establish one-to-one matching correspondences between LiDAR frames. We introduce a novel deep learning-based real-time (approx. 35-40ms per frame) LO method that jointly learns accurate frame-to-frame correspondences and model's predictive uncertainty (PU) as evidence to safe-guard LO predictions. In this work, we propose (i) partial optimal transportation of LiDAR feature descriptor for robust LO estimation, (ii) joint learning of predictive uncertainty while learning odometry over driving sequences, and (iii) demonstrate how PU can serve as evidence for necessary pose-graph optimization when LO network is either under or over confident. We evaluate our method on KITTI dataset and show competitive performance, even superior generalization ability over recent state-of-the-art approaches.

| **[4DRVO-Net: Deep 4D Radar-Visual Odometry Using Multi-Modal and Multi-Scale Adaptive Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06573v1)** | 2023-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Four-dimensional (4D) radar--visual odometry (4DRVO) integrates complementary information from 4D radar and cameras, making it an attractive solution for achieving accurate and robust pose estimation. However, 4DRVO may exhibit significant tracking errors owing to three main factors: 1) sparsity of 4D radar point clouds; 2) inaccurate data association and insufficient feature interaction between the 4D radar and camera; and 3) disturbances caused by dynamic objects in the environment, affecting odometry estimation. In this paper, we present 4DRVO-Net, which is a method for 4D radar--visual odometry. This method leverages the feature pyramid, pose warping, and cost volume (PWC) network architecture to progressively estimate and refine poses. Specifically, we propose a multi-scale feature extraction network called Radar-PointNet++ that fully considers rich 4D radar point information, enabling fine-grained learning for sparse 4D radar point clouds. To effectively integrate the two modalities, we design an adaptive 4D radar--camera fusion module (A-RCFM) that automatically selects image features based on 4D radar point features, facilitating multi-scale cross-modal feature interaction and adaptive multi-modal feature fusion. In addition, we introduce a velocity-guided point-confidence estimation module to measure local motion patterns, reduce the influence of dynamic objects and outliers, and provide continuous updates during pose refinement. We demonstrate the excellent performance of our method and the effectiveness of each module design on both the VoD and in-house datasets. Our method outperforms all learning-based and geometry-based methods for most sequences in the VoD dataset. Furthermore, it has exhibited promising performance that closely approaches that of the 64-line LiDAR odometry results of A-LOAM without mapping optimization.</p></details> | 14 pages,12 figures |
| **[LiDAR View Synthesis for Robust Vehicle Navigation Without Expert Labels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01424v2)** | 2023-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models for self-driving cars require a diverse training dataset to manage critical driving scenarios on public roads safely. This includes having data from divergent trajectories, such as the oncoming traffic lane or sidewalks. Such data would be too dangerous to collect in the real world. Data augmentation approaches have been proposed to tackle this issue using RGB images. However, solutions based on LiDAR sensors are scarce. Therefore, we propose synthesizing additional LiDAR point clouds from novel viewpoints without physically driving at dangerous positions. The LiDAR view synthesis is done using mesh reconstruction and ray casting. We train a deep learning model, which takes a LiDAR scan as input and predicts the future trajectory as output. A waypoint controller is then applied to this predicted trajectory to determine the throttle and steering labels of the ego-vehicle. Our method neither requires expert driving labels for the original nor the synthesized LiDAR sequence. Instead, we infer labels from LiDAR odometry. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in a comprehensive online evaluation and with a comparison to concurrent work. Our results show the importance of synthesizing additional LiDAR point clouds, particularly in terms of model robustness. Project page: https://jonathsch.github.io/lidar-synthesis/</p></details> |  |
| **[3D-SeqMOS: A Novel Sequential 3D Moving Object Segmentation in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09044v1)** | 2023-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For the SLAM system in robotics and autonomous driving, the accuracy of front-end odometry and back-end loop-closure detection determine the whole intelligent system performance. But the LiDAR-SLAM could be disturbed by current scene moving objects, resulting in drift errors and even loop-closure failure. Thus, the ability to detect and segment moving objects is essential for high-precision positioning and building a consistent map. In this paper, we address the problem of moving object segmentation from 3D LiDAR scans to improve the odometry and loop-closure accuracy of SLAM. We propose a novel 3D Sequential Moving-Object-Segmentation (3D-SeqMOS) method that can accurately segment the scene into moving and static objects, such as moving and static cars. Different from the existing projected-image method, we process the raw 3D point cloud and build a 3D convolution neural network for MOS task. In addition, to make full use of the spatio-temporal information of point cloud, we propose a point cloud residual mechanism using the spatial features of current scan and the temporal features of previous residual scans. Besides, we build a complete SLAM framework to verify the effectiveness and accuracy of 3D-SeqMOS. Experiments on SemanticKITTI dataset show that our proposed 3D-SeqMOS method can effectively detect moving objects and improve the accuracy of LiDAR odometry and loop-closure detection. The test results show our 3D-SeqMOS outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 12.4%. We extend the proposed method to the SemanticKITTI: Moving Object Segmentation competition and achieve the 2nd in the leaderboard, showing its effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[High Resolution Point Clouds from mmWave Radar](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.09273v2)** | 2023-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper explores a machine learning approach for generating high resolution point clouds from a single-chip mmWave radar. Unlike lidar and vision-based systems, mmWave radar can operate in harsh environments and see through occlusions like smoke, fog, and dust. Unfortunately, current mmWave processing techniques offer poor spatial resolution compared to lidar point clouds. This paper presents RadarHD, an end-to-end neural network that constructs lidar-like point clouds from low resolution radar input. Enhancing radar images is challenging due to the presence of specular and spurious reflections. Radar data also doesn't map well to traditional image processing techniques due to the signal's sinc-like spreading pattern. We overcome these challenges by training RadarHD on a large volume of raw I/Q radar data paired with lidar point clouds across diverse indoor settings. Our experiments show the ability to generate rich point clouds even in scenes unobserved during training and in the presence of heavy smoke occlusion. Further, RadarHD's point clouds are high-quality enough to work with existing lidar odometry and mapping workflows.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spoofing-Resilient LiDAR-GPS Factor Graph Localization with Chimera Authentication](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04692v1)** | 2023-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many vehicle platforms typically use sensors such as LiDAR or camera for locally-referenced navigation with GPS for globally-referenced navigation. However, due to the unencrypted nature of GPS signals, all civilian users are vulner-able to spoofing attacks, where a malicious spoofer broadcasts fabricated signals and causes the user to track a false position fix. To protect against such GPS spoofing attacks, Chips-Message Robust Authentication (Chimera) has been developed and will be tested on the Navigation Technology Satellite 3 (NTS-3) satellite being launched later this year. However, Chimera authentication is not continuously available and may not provide sufficient protection for vehicles which rely on more frequent GPS measurements. In this paper, we propose a factor graph-based state estimation framework which integrates LiDAR and GPS while simultaneously detecting and mitigating spoofing attacks experienced between consecutive Chimera authentications. Our proposed framework combines GPS pseudorange measurements with LiDAR odometry to provide a robust navigation solution. A chi-squared detector, based on pseudorange residuals, is used to detect and mitigate any potential GPS spoofing attacks. We evaluate our method using real-world LiDAR data from the KITTI dataset and simulated GPS measurements, both nominal and with spoofing. Across multiple trajectories and Monte Carlo runs, our method consistently achieves position errors under 5 m during nominal conditions, and successfully bounds positioning error to within odometry drift levels during spoofed conditions.</p></details> |  |

The proposed method is based on two popular approaches, ORB-SLAM and A-LOAM, with monocular scale correction and visual-bootstrapped LiDAR poses initialization modifications. The scale corrector calculates the proportion between the depth of image keypoints recovered by triangulation and that provided by LiDAR, using an outlier rejection process for accuracy improvement. Concerning LiDAR poses initialization, the visual odometry approach gives the initial guesses of LiDAR motions for better performance. This methodology is not only applicable to high-resolution LiDAR but can also adapt to low-resolution LiDAR. To evaluate the proposed SLAM system's robustness and accuracy, we conducted experiments on the KITTI Odometry and S3E datasets. Experimental results illustrate that our method significantly outperforms standalone ORB-SLAM2 and A-LOAM. Furthermore, regarding the accuracy of visual odometry with scale correction, our method performs similarly to the stereo-mode ORB-SLAM2.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 7 figures, 32 references</p></details> |

The analyzed method uses these two parameters to calculate weights for Iterative Re-weighted Least Squares. This adaptive nature of the weights can be helpful in situations where the noise level varies in the measurements. We test our algorithm first on the point cloud registration problem with synthetic data sets and LiDAR odometry with open source real-world data sets. We show that the existing approach needs an additional manual tuning of a residual scale parameter which our method directly learns from data and has similar or better performance. We further present the idea of decoupling scale and shape parameters to improve performance of the algorithm. We give detailed analysis of our algorithm along with its comparison with similar well-known algorithms from literature to show the benefits of the proposed approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems</p></details> |

Inspired by the rodent hippocampus, this paper presents a biologically inspired SLAM system based on a LiDAR sensor using a hippocampal model to build a cognitive map and estimate the robot pose in indoor environments. Based on the biologically inspired models mimicking boundary cells, place cells, and head direction cells, the SLAM system using LiDAR point cloud data is capable of leveraging the self-motion cues from the LiDAR odometry and the boundary cues from the LiDAR boundary cells to build a cognitive map and estimate the robot pose. Experiment results show that with the LiDAR boundary cells the proposed SLAM system greatly outperforms the camera-based brain-inspired method in both simulation and indoor environments, and is competitive with the conventional LiDAR-based SLAM methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quadric Representations for LiDAR Odometry, Mapping and Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14190v1)** | 2023-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current LiDAR odometry, mapping and localization methods leverage point-wise representations of 3D scenes and achieve high accuracy in autonomous driving tasks. However, the space-inefficiency of methods that use point-wise representations limits their development and usage in practical applications. In particular, scan-submap matching and global map representation methods are restricted by the inefficiency of nearest neighbor searching (NNS) for large-volume point clouds. To improve space-time efficiency, we propose a novel method of describing scenes using quadric surfaces, which are far more compact representations of 3D objects than conventional point clouds. In contrast to point cloud-based methods, our quadric representation-based method decomposes a 3D scene into a collection of sparse quadric patches, which improves storage efficiency and avoids the slow point-wise NNS process. Our method first segments a given point cloud into patches and fits each of them to a quadric implicit function. Each function is then coupled with other geometric descriptors of the patch, such as its center position and covariance matrix. Collectively, these patch representations fully describe a 3D scene, which can be used in place of the original point cloud and employed in LiDAR odometry, mapping and localization algorithms. We further design a novel incremental growing method for quadric representations, which eliminates the need to repeatedly re-fit quadric surfaces from the original point cloud. Extensive odometry, mapping and localization experiments on large-volume point clouds in the KITTI and UrbanLoco datasets demonstrate that our method maintains low latency and memory utility while achieving competitive, and even superior, accuracy.</p></details> |  |

However, it faces many challenges in real-world scenarios, such as the prior information about the environment being absent and poor communication among the team members. This work presents DCL-SLAM, a fully distributed collaborative LiDAR SLAM framework intended for the robotic swarm to simultaneously co-localize in an unknown environment with minimal information exchange. Based on ad-hoc wireless peer-to-peer communication (limited bandwidth and communication range), DCL-SLAM adopts the lightweight LiDAR-Iris descriptor for place recognition and does not require full connectivity among teams. DCL-SLAM includes three main parts: a replaceable single-robot front-end that produces LiDAR odometry results; a distributed loop closure module that detects inter-robot loop closures with keyframes; and a distributed back-end module that adapts distributed pose graph optimizer combined with a pairwise consistent measurement set maximization algorithm to reject spurious inter-robot loop closures. We integrate our proposed framework with diverse open-source LiDAR odometry methods to show its versatility. The proposed system is extensively evaluated on benchmarking datasets and field experiments over various scales and environments. Experimental result shows that DCL-SLAM achieves higher accuracy and lower communication bandwidth than other state-of-art multi-robot SLAM systems.

| **[NeRF-LOAM: Neural Implicit Representation for Large-Scale Incremental LiDAR Odometry and Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10709v1)** | 2023-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simultaneously odometry and mapping using LiDAR data is an important task for mobile systems to achieve full autonomy in large-scale environments. However, most existing LiDAR-based methods prioritize tracking quality over reconstruction quality. Although the recently developed neural radiance fields (NeRF) have shown promising advances in implicit reconstruction for indoor environments, the problem of simultaneous odometry and mapping for large-scale scenarios using incremental LiDAR data remains unexplored. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose a novel NeRF-based LiDAR odometry and mapping approach, NeRF-LOAM, consisting of three modules neural odometry, neural mapping, and mesh reconstruction. All these modules utilize our proposed neural signed distance function, which separates LiDAR points into ground and non-ground points to reduce Z-axis drift, optimizes odometry and voxel embeddings concurrently, and in the end generates dense smooth mesh maps of the environment. Moreover, this joint optimization allows our NeRF-LOAM to be pre-trained free and exhibit strong generalization abilities when applied to different environments. Extensive evaluations on three publicly available datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art odometry and mapping performance, as well as a strong generalization in large-scale environments utilizing LiDAR data. Furthermore, we perform multiple ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of our network design. The implementation of our approach will be made available at https://github.com/JunyuanDeng/NeRF-LOAM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimized SC-F-LOAM: Optimized Fast LiDAR Odometry and Mapping Using Scan Context](http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.04932v2)** | 2023-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR odometry can achieve accurate vehicle pose estimation for short driving range or in small-scale environments, but for long driving range or in large-scale environments, the accuracy deteriorates as a result of cumulative estimation errors. This drawback necessitates the inclusion of loop closure detection in a SLAM framework to suppress the adverse effects of cumulative errors. To improve the accuracy of pose estimation, we propose a new LiDAR-based SLAM method which uses F-LOAM as LiDAR odometry, Scan Context for loop closure detection, and GTSAM for global optimization. In our approach, an adaptive distance threshold (instead of a fixed threshold) is employed for loop closure detection, which achieves more accurate loop closure detection results. Besides, a feature-based matching method is used in our approach to compute vehicle pose transformations between loop closure point cloud pairs, instead of using the raw point cloud obtained by the LiDAR sensor, which significantly reduces the computation time. The KITTI dataset is used for verifications of our method, and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms typical LiDAR odometry/SLAM methods in the literature. Our code is made publicly available for the benefit of the community.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semantic Geometric Fusion Multi-object Tracking and Lidar Odometry in Dynamic Environment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11621v5)** | 2023-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The SLAM system based on static scene assumption will introduce huge estimation errors when moving objects appear in the field of view. This paper proposes a novel multi-object dynamic lidar odometry (MLO) based on semantic object detection technology to solve this problem. The MLO system can provide reliable localization of robot and semantic objects and build long-term static maps in complex dynamic scenes. For ego-motion estimation, we use the environment features that take semantic and geometric consistency constraints into account in the extraction process. The filtering features are robust to semantic movable and unknown dynamic objects. At the same time, a least square estimator using the semantic bounding box and object point cloud is proposed to achieve accurate and stable multi-object tracking between frames. In the mapping module, we further realize dynamic semantic object detection based on the absolute trajectory tracking list (ATTL). Then, static semantic objects and environmental features can be used to eliminate accumulated localization errors and build pure static maps. Experiments on public KITTI data sets show that the proposed system can achieve more accurate and robust tracking of the object and better real-time localization accuracy in complex scenes compared with existing technologies.</p></details> |  |
| **[3D LiDAR Aided GNSS NLOS Mitigation for Reliable GNSS-RTK Positioning in Urban Canyons](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05477v1)** | 2022-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>GNSS and LiDAR odometry are complementary as they provide absolute and relative positioning, respectively. Their integration in a loosely-coupled manner is straightforward but is challenged in urban canyons due to the GNSS signal reflections. Recent proposed 3D LiDAR-aided (3DLA) GNSS methods employ the point cloud map to identify the non-line-of-sight (NLOS) reception of GNSS signals. This facilitates the GNSS receiver to obtain improved urban positioning but not achieve a sub-meter level. GNSS real-time kinematics (RTK) uses carrier phase measurements to obtain decimeter-level positioning. In urban areas, the GNSS RTK is not only challenged by multipath and NLOS-affected measurement but also suffers from signal blockage by the building. The latter will impose a challenge in solving the ambiguity within the carrier phase measurements. In the other words, the model observability of the ambiguity resolution (AR) is greatly decreased. This paper proposes to generate virtual satellite (VS) measurements using the selected LiDAR landmarks from the accumulated 3D point cloud maps (PCM). These LiDAR-PCM-made VS measurements are tightly-coupled with GNSS pseudorange and carrier phase measurements. Thus, the VS measurements can provide complementary constraints, meaning providing low-elevation-angle measurements in the across-street directions. The implementation is done using factor graph optimization to solve an accurate float solution of the ambiguity before it is fed into LAMBDA. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been validated by the evaluation conducted on our recently open-sourced challenging dataset, UrbanNav. The result shows the fix rate of the proposed 3DLA GNSS RTK is about 30% while the conventional GNSS-RTK only achieves about 14%. In addition, the proposed method achieves sub-meter positioning accuracy in most of the data collected in challenging urban areas.</p></details> |  |
| **[DL-SLOT: Dynamic LiDAR SLAM and object tracking based on collaborative graph optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02077v1)** | 2022-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ego-pose estimation and dynamic object tracking are two critical problems for autonomous driving systems. The solutions to these problems are generally based on their respective assumptions, \ie{the static world assumption for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and the accurate ego-pose assumption for object tracking}. However, these assumptions are challenging to hold in dynamic road scenarios, where SLAM and object tracking become closely correlated. Therefore, we propose DL-SLOT, a dynamic LiDAR SLAM and object tracking method, to simultaneously address these two coupled problems. This method integrates the state estimations of both the autonomous vehicle and the stationary and dynamic objects in the environment into a unified optimization framework. First, we used object detection to identify all points belonging to potentially dynamic objects. Subsequently, a LiDAR odometry was conducted using the filtered point cloud. Simultaneously, we proposed a sliding window-based object association method that accurately associates objects according to the historical trajectories of tracked objects. The ego-states and those of the stationary and dynamic objects are integrated into the sliding window-based collaborative graph optimization. The stationary objects are subsequently restored from the potentially dynamic object set. Finally, a global pose-graph is implemented to eliminate the accumulated error. Experiments on KITTI datasets demonstrate that our method achieves better accuracy than SLAM and object tracking baseline methods. This confirms that solving SLAM and object tracking simultaneously is mutually advantageous, dramatically improving the robustness and accuracy of SLAM and object tracking in dynamic road scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 10 figures, this work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

For quadrupeds to navigate without a predefined map a priori, they must rely on SLAM approaches to localize and build the map of the environment. Despite the surge of interest and research development in SLAM and quadrupeds, there still has yet to be an open-source package that capitalizes on the onboard sensors of an affordable quadruped. This motivates the A1 SLAM package, which is an open-source ROS package that provides the Unitree A1 quadruped with real-time, high performing SLAM capabilities using the default sensors shipped with the robot. A1 SLAM solves the PoseSLAM problem using the factor graph paradigm to optimize for the poses throughout the trajectory. A major design feature of the algorithm is using a sliding window of fully connected LiDAR odometry factors. A1 SLAM has been benchmarked against Google's Cartographer and has showed superior performance especially with trajectories experiencing aggressive motion.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[BoW3D: Bag of Words for Real-Time Loop Closing in 3D LiDAR SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07473v2)** | 2022-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Loop closing is a fundamental part of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) for autonomous mobile systems. In the field of visual SLAM, bag of words (BoW) has achieved great success in loop closure. The BoW features for loop searching can also be used in the subsequent 6-DoF loop correction. However, for 3D LiDAR SLAM, the state-of-the-art methods may fail to effectively recognize the loop in real time, and usually cannot correct the full 6-DoF loop pose. To address this limitation, we present a novel Bag of Words for real-time loop closing in 3D LiDAR SLAM, called BoW3D. Our method not only efficiently recognizes the revisited loop places, but also corrects the full 6-DoF loop pose in real time. BoW3D builds the bag of words based on the 3D LiDAR feature LinK3D, which is efficient, pose-invariant and can be used for accurate point-to-point matching. We furthermore embed our proposed method into 3D LiDAR odometry system to evaluate loop closing performance. We test our method on public dataset, and compare it against other state-of-the-art algorithms. BoW3D shows better performance in terms of F1 max and extended precision scores on most scenarios. It is noticeable that BoW3D takes an average of 48 ms to recognize and correct the loops on KITTI 00 (includes 4K+ 64-ray LiDAR scans), when executed on a notebook with an Intel Core i7 @2.2 GHz processor. We release the implementation of our method here: https://github.com/YungeCui/BoW3D.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)/ICRA 2023</p></details> |

Our proposed method is generalized in that it can seamlessly fuse various local geometric shapes around points to improve the position estimation accuracy compared to the conventional LiDAR odometry and mapping (LOAM) method. To utilize continuous geometric features for LiDAR odometry estimation, we incorporate tiny neural networks into a generalized iterative closest point (GICP) algorithm. These neural networks improve the data association metric and the matching cost function using local geometric features. Experiments with the KITTI benchmark demonstrate that our proposed method reduces relative trajectory errors compared to the other LiDAR odometry estimation methods.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |
| **[WGICP: Differentiable Weighted GICP-Based Lidar Odometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09777v2)** | 2022-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel differentiable weighted generalized iterative closest point (WGICP) method applicable to general 3D point cloud data, including that from Lidar. Our method builds on differentiable generalized ICP (GICP), and we propose using the differentiable K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm to enhance differentiability. The differentiable GICP algorithm provides the gradient of output pose estimation with respect to each input point, which allows us to train a neural network to predict its importance, or weight, in estimating the correct pose. In contrast to the other ICP-based methods that use voxel-based downsampling or matching methods to reduce the computational cost, our method directly reduces the number of points used for GICP by only selecting those with the highest weights and ignoring redundant ones with lower weights. We show that our method improves both accuracy and speed of the GICP algorithm for the KITTI dataset and can be used to develop a more robust and efficient SLAM system.</p></details> | 6 pages |

The existing line of studies mostly focuses on one pass undistortion, which means undistortion for each point is conducted only once in the whole LiDAR-IMU odometry pipeline. In this paper, we propose an optimization based tightly coupled LiDAR-IMU odometry addressing iterated point-level undistortion. By jointly minimizing the cost derived from LiDAR and IMU measurements, our LiDAR-IMU odometry method performs more accurate and robust in high dynamic environment. Besides, the method characters good computation efficiency by limiting the quantity of parameters.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present a global descriptor, named Normal Distribution Descriptor (NDD), for 3D point cloud loop closure detection. The descriptor encodes both the probability density score and entropy of a point cloud as the descriptor. We also propose a fast rotation alignment process and use correlation coefficient as the similarity between descriptors. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art point cloud descriptors in both accuracy and efficency.

| **[LMBAO: A Landmark Map for Bundle Adjustment Odometry in LiDAR SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08810v1)** | 2022-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR odometry is one of the essential parts of LiDAR simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). However, existing LiDAR odometry tends to match a new scan simply iteratively with previous fixed-pose scans, gradually accumulating errors. Furthermore, as an effective joint optimization mechanism, bundle adjustment (BA) cannot be directly introduced into real-time odometry due to the intensive computation of large-scale global landmarks. Therefore, this letter designs a new strategy named a landmark map for bundle adjustment odometry (LMBAO) in LiDAR SLAM to solve these problems. First, BA-based odometry is further developed with an active landmark maintenance strategy for a more accurate local registration and avoiding cumulative errors. Specifically, this paper keeps entire stable landmarks on the map instead of just their feature points in the sliding window and deletes the landmarks according to their active grade. Next, the sliding window length is reduced, and marginalization is performed to retain the scans outside the window but corresponding to active landmarks on the map, greatly simplifying the computation and improving the real-time properties. In addition, experiments on three challenging datasets show that our algorithm achieves real-time performance in outdoor driving and outperforms state-of-the-art LiDAR SLAM algorithms, including Lego-LOAM and VLOM.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 tables, 6 figures</p></details> |

In this architecture, the projection-aware representation of the 3D point cloud is proposed to organize the raw 3D point cloud into an ordered data form to achieve efficiency. The Pyramid, Warping, and Cost volume (PWC) structure for the LiDAR odometry task is built to estimate and refine the pose in a coarse-to-fine approach. A projection-aware attentive cost volume is built to directly associate two discrete point clouds and obtain embedding motion patterns. Then, a trainable embedding mask is proposed to weigh the local motion patterns to regress the overall pose and filter outlier points. The trainable pose warp-refinement module is iteratively used with embedding mask optimized hierarchically to make the pose estimation more robust for outliers. The entire architecture is holistically optimized end-to-end to achieve adaptive learning of cost volume and mask, and all operations involving point cloud sampling and grouping are accelerated by projection-aware 3D feature learning methods. The superior performance and effectiveness of our LiDAR odometry architecture are demonstrated on KITTI, M2DGR, and Argoverse datasets. Our method outperforms all recent learning-based methods and even the geometry-based approach, LOAM with mapping optimization, on most sequences of KITTI odometry dataset.

Poor synchronization performance, due to incorrect timestamping procedure, may negatively affect the algorithms' state estimation results. To provide highly accurate and precise synchronization between the sensors, we introduce an open-source hardware-software LiDAR to other sensors time synchronization system that exploits a dedicated hardware LiDAR time synchronization interface by providing emulated GNSS-clock to this interface, no physical GNSS-receiver is needed. The emulator is based on a general-purpose microcontroller and, due to concise hardware and software architecture, can be easily modified or extended for synchronization of sets of different sensors such as cameras, inertial measurement units (IMUs), wheel encoders, other LiDARs, etc. In the paper, we provide an example of such a system with synchronized LiDAR and IMU sensors. We conducted an evaluation of the sensors synchronization accuracy and precision, and state 1 microsecond performance. We compared our results with timestamping provided by ROS software and by a LiDAR inner clocking scheme to underline clear advantages over these two baseline methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE ISPCS 2022 Conference (International Symposium on Precision Clock Synchronization for Measurement, Control and Communication)</p></details> |
| **[InTEn-LOAM: Intensity and Temporal Enhanced LiDAR Odometry and Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05708v1)** | 2022-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional LiDAR odometry (LO) systems mainly leverage geometric information obtained from the traversed surroundings to register laser scans and estimate LiDAR ego-motion, while it may be unreliable in dynamic or unstructured environments. This paper proposes InTEn-LOAM, a low-drift and robust LiDAR odometry and mapping method that fully exploits implicit information of laser sweeps (i.e., geometric, intensity, and temporal characteristics). Scanned points are projected to cylindrical images, which facilitate the efficient and adaptive extraction of various types of features, i.e., ground, beam, facade, and reflector. We propose a novel intensity-based points registration algorithm and incorporate it into the LiDAR odometry, enabling the LO system to jointly estimate the LiDAR ego-motion using both geometric and intensity feature points. To eliminate the interference of dynamic objects, we propose a temporal-based dynamic object removal approach to filter them out before map update. Moreover, the local map is organized and downsampled using a temporal-related voxel grid filter to maintain the similarity between the current scan and the static local map. Extensive experiments are conducted on both simulated and real-world datasets. The results show that the proposed method achieves similar or better accuracy w.r.t the state-of-the-arts in normal driving scenarios and outperforms geometric-based LO in unstructured environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pseudo-LiDAR for Visual Odometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01567v1)** | 2022-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the existing methods, LiDAR odometry shows superior performance, but visual odometry is still widely used for its price advantage. Conventionally, the task of visual odometry mainly rely on the input of continuous images. However, it is very complicated for the odometry network to learn the epipolar geometry information provided by the images. In this paper, the concept of pseudo-LiDAR is introduced into the odometry to solve this problem. The pseudo-LiDAR point cloud back-projects the depth map generated by the image into the 3D point cloud, which changes the way of image representation. Compared with the stereo images, the pseudo-LiDAR point cloud generated by the stereo matching network can get the explicit 3D coordinates. Since the 6 Degrees of Freedom (DoF) pose transformation occurs in 3D space, the 3D structure information provided by the pseudo-LiDAR point cloud is more direct than the image. Compared with sparse LiDAR, the pseudo-LiDAR has a denser point cloud. In order to make full use of the rich point cloud information provided by the pseudo-LiDAR, a projection-aware dense odometry pipeline is adopted. Most previous LiDAR-based algorithms sampled 8192 points from the point cloud as input to the odometry network. The projection-aware dense odometry pipeline takes all the pseudo-LiDAR point clouds generated from the images except for the error points as the input to the network. While making full use of the 3D geometric information in the images, the semantic information in the images is also used in the odometry task. The fusion of 2D-3D is achieved in an image-only based odometry. Experiments on the KITTI dataset prove the effectiveness of our method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first visual odometry method using pseudo-LiDAR.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |

These SLAM systems are required to support accurate localization with limited computational resources. In particular, point cloud registration, i.e., the process of matching and aligning multiple LiDAR scans collected at multiple locations in a global coordinate framework, has been deemed as the bottleneck step in SLAM. In this paper, we propose a feature filtering algorithm, PFilter, that can filter out invalid features and can thus greatly alleviate this bottleneck. Meanwhile, the overall registration accuracy is also improved due to the carefully curated feature points. We integrate PFilter into the well-established scan-to-map LiDAR odometry framework, F-LOAM, and evaluate its performance on the KITTI dataset. The experimental results show that PFilter can remove about 48.4% of the points in the local feature map and reduce feature points in scan by 19.3% on average, which save 20.9% processing time per frame. In the mean time, we improve the accuracy by 9.4%.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures. Accepted for IEEE IROS 2022</p></details> |

Research indicates that diverse LiDAR points have different influences on the accuracy of pose estimation. This study aimed to select a good point set to enhance accuracy. Accordingly, the sensitivity and uncertainty of LiDAR point residuals were formulated as a fundamental basis for derivation and analysis. High-sensitivity and low -uncertainty point residual terms are preferred to achieve higher pose estimation accuracy. The proposed selection method has been theoretically proven to be capable of achieving a global statistical optimum. It was tested on artificial data and compared with the KITTI benchmark. It was also implemented in LiDAR odometry (LO) and LiDAR inertial odometry (LIO), both indoors and outdoors. The experiments revealed that utilizing selected LiDAR point residuals simultaneously enhances optimization accuracy, decreases residual terms, and guarantees real-time performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning-based Localizability Estimation for Robust LiDAR Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05698v2)** | 2022-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR-based localization and mapping is one of the core components in many modern robotic systems due to the direct integration of range and geometry, allowing for precise motion estimation and generation of high quality maps in real-time. Yet, as a consequence of insufficient environmental constraints present in the scene, this dependence on geometry can result in localization failure, happening in self-symmetric surroundings such as tunnels. This work addresses precisely this issue by proposing a neural network-based estimation approach for detecting (non-)localizability during robot operation. Special attention is given to the localizability of scan-to-scan registration, as it is a crucial component in many LiDAR odometry estimation pipelines. In contrast to previous, mostly traditional detection approaches, the proposed method enables early detection of failure by estimating the localizability on raw sensor measurements without evaluating the underlying registration optimization. Moreover, previous approaches remain limited in their ability to generalize across environments and sensor types, as heuristic-tuning of degeneracy detection thresholds is required. The proposed approach avoids this problem by learning from a collection of different environments, allowing the network to function over various scenarios. Furthermore, the network is trained exclusively on simulated data, avoiding arduous data collection in challenging and degenerate, often hard-to-access, environments. The presented method is tested during field experiments conducted across challenging environments and on two different sensor types without any modifications. The observed detection performance is on par with state-of-the-art methods after environment-specific threshold tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Scan matching, the process of estimating the rigid transformation that best aligns two point clouds, is the basis for lidar odometry, a form of dead reckoning. Lidar odometry is particularly useful when absolute sensors, like GPS, are not available. Here we propose the Iterative Closest Ellipsoidal Transform (ICET), a scan matching algorithm which provides two novel improvements over the current state-of-the-art Normal Distributions Transform (NDT). Like NDT, ICET decomposes lidar data into voxels and fits a Gaussian distribution to the points within each voxel. The first innovation of ICET reduces geometric ambiguity along large flat surfaces by suppressing the solution along those directions. The second innovation of ICET is to infer the output error covariance associated with the position and orientation transformation between successive point clouds; the error covariance is particularly useful when ICET is incorporated into a state-estimation routine such as an extended Kalman filter. We constructed a simulation to compare the performance of ICET and NDT in 2D space both with and without geometric ambiguity and found that ICET produces superior estimates while accurately predicting solution accuracy.</p></details> |  |

However, achieving reliable and efficient performance on heterogeneous platforms in large-scale environments remains an open challenge due to the limitations of onboard computation and memory resources needed for autonomous operation. In this work, we present LOCUS 2.0, a robust and computationally-efficient \lidar odometry system for real-time underground 3D mapping. LOCUS 2.0 includes a novel normals-based \morrell{Generalized Iterative Closest Point (GICP)} formulation that reduces the computation time of point cloud alignment, an adaptive voxel grid filter that maintains the desired computation load regardless of the environment's geometry, and a sliding-window map approach that bounds the memory consumption. The proposed approach is shown to be suitable to be deployed on heterogeneous robotic platforms involved in large-scale explorations under severe computation and memory constraints. We demonstrate LOCUS 2.0, a key element of the CoSTAR team's entry in the DARPA Subterranean Challenge, across various underground scenarios. We release LOCUS 2.0 as an open-source library and also release a \lidar-based odometry dataset in challenging and large-scale underground environments.

In particular, ground-optimized LiDAR odometry usually employs ground segmentation as a preprocessing method. This is because most of the points in a 3D point cloud captured by a 3D LiDAR sensor on a terrestrial platform are from the ground. However, the effect of the performance of ground segmentation on LiDAR odometry is still not closely examined. In this paper, a robust ground-optimized LiDAR odometry framework is proposed to facilitate the study to check the effect of ground segmentation on LiDAR SLAM based on the state-of-the-art (SOTA) method. By using our proposed odometry framework, it is easy and straightforward to test whether ground segmentation algorithms help extract well-described features and thus improve SLAM performance. In addition, by leveraging the SOTA ground segmentation method called Patchwork, which shows robust ground segmentation even in complex and uneven urban environments with little performance perturbation, a novel ground-optimized LiDAR odometry is proposed, called PaGO-LOAM. The methods were tested using the KITTI odometry dataset. \textit{PaGO-LOAM} shows robust and accurate performance compared with the baseline method.

In recent years, deep learning methods have been widely used in lidar odomety tasks, but most of the current methods only extract the global features of the point clouds. It is impossible to obtain more detailed point-level features in this way. In addition, only the fully connected layer is used to estimate the pose. The fully connected layer has achieved obvious results in the classification task, but the changes in pose are a continuous rather than discrete process, high-precision pose estimation can not be obtained only by using the fully connected layer. Our method avoids problems mentioned above. We use PointPWC as our backbone network. PointPWC is originally used for scene flow estimation. The scene flow estimation task has a strong correlation with lidar odomety. Traget point clouds can be obtained by adding the scene flow and source point clouds. We can achieve the pose directly through ICP algorithm solved by SVD, and the fully connected layer is no longer used. PointPWC extracts point-level features from point clouds with different sampling levels, which solves the problem of too rough feature extraction. We conduct experiments on KITTI, Ford Campus Vision and Lidar DataSe and Apollo-SouthBay Dataset. Our result is comparable with the state-of-the-art unsupervised deep learing method SelfVoxeLO.</p></details> |  |

Many existing lidar odometry methods wait for an entire sweep from the lidar before processing the data. This introduces a large delay between the first laser firing and its pose estimate. To reduce this latency, we treat the spinning lidar as a streaming sensor and process packets as they arrive. This effectively distributes expensive operations across time, resulting in a very fast and lightweight system with much higher throughput and lower latency.

However, given the complex scenarios and the low-resolution LiDAR, finding reliable structures for identifying correspondences can be challenging. In this paper, we delve into structure reliability for accurate self-supervised ego-motion estimation and aim to alleviate the influence of unreliable structures in training, inference and mapping phases. We improve the self-supervised LiDAR odometry substantially from three aspects: 1) A two-stage odometry estimation network is developed, where we obtain the ego-motion by estimating a set of sub-region transformations and averaging them with a motion voting mechanism, to encourage the network focusing on representative structures. 2) The inherent alignment errors, which cannot be eliminated via ego-motion optimization, are down-weighted in losses based on the 3D point covariance estimations. 3) The discovered representative structures and learned point covariances are incorporated in the mapping module to improve the robustness of map construction. Our two-frame odometry outperforms the previous state of the arts by 16%/12% in terms of translational/rotational errors on the KITTI dataset and performs consistently well on the Apollo-Southbay datasets. We can even rival the fully supervised counterparts with our mapping module and more unlabeled training data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L) and International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), 2022</p></details> |

For this, we propose a new real-time LiDAR-only odometry method called CT-ICP (for Continuous-Time ICP), completed into a full SLAM with a novel loop detection procedure. The core of this method, is the introduction of the combined continuity in the scan matching, and discontinuity between scans. It allows both the elastic distortion of the scan during the registration for increased precision, and the increased robustness to high frequency motions from the discontinuity. We build a complete SLAM on top of this odometry, using a fast pure LiDAR loop detection based on elevation image 2D matching, providing a pose graph with loop constraints. To show the robustness of the method, we tested it on seven datasets: KITTI, KITTI-raw, KITTI-360, KITTI-CARLA, ParisLuco, Newer College, and NCLT in driving and high-frequency motion scenarios. Both the CT-ICP odometry and the loop detection are made available online.

We argue that a major source of error for ICP is in the input data itself, from the sensor noise to the scene geometry. Benefiting from recent developments in deep learning for point clouds, we propose a data-driven approach to learn an error model for ICP. We estimate covariances modeling data-dependent heteroscedastic aleatoric uncertainty, and epistemic uncertainty using a variational Bayesian approach. The system evaluation is performed on LiDAR odometry on different datasets, highlighting good results in comparison to the state of the art.</p></details> |  |
| **[DL-SLOT: Dynamic Lidar SLAM and Object Tracking Based On Graph Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.11431v1)** | 2022-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ego-pose estimation and dynamic object tracking are two key issues in an autonomous driving system. Two assumptions are often made for them, i.e. the static world assumption of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and the exact ego-pose assumption of object tracking, respectively. However, these assumptions are difficult to hold in highly dynamic road scenarios where SLAM and object tracking become correlated and mutually beneficial. In this paper, DL-SLOT, a dynamic Lidar SLAM and object tracking method is proposed. This method integrates the state estimations of both the ego vehicle and the static and dynamic objects in the environment into a unified optimization framework, to realize SLAM and object tracking (SLOT) simultaneously. Firstly, we implement object detection to remove all the points that belong to potential dynamic objects. Then, LiDAR odometry is conducted using the filtered point cloud. At the same time, detected objects are associated with the history object trajectories based on the time-series information in a sliding window. The states of the static and dynamic objects and ego vehicle in the sliding window are integrated into a unified local optimization framework. We perform SLAM and object tracking simultaneously in this framework, which significantly improves the robustness and accuracy of SLAM in highly dynamic road scenarios and the accuracy of objects' states estimation. Experiments on public datasets have shown that our method achieves better accuracy than A-LOAM.</p></details> |  |

However, most methods still face two substantial challenges: 1) the 2D projection representation of LiDAR data cannot effectively encode 3D structures from the point clouds; 2) the needs for a large amount of labeled data for training limit the application scope of these methods. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised LiDAR odometry method, dubbed SelfVoxeLO, to tackle these two difficulties. Specifically, we propose a 3D convolution network to process the raw LiDAR data directly, which extracts features that better encode the 3D geometric patterns. To suit our network to self-supervised learning, we design several novel loss functions that utilize the inherent properties of LiDAR point clouds. Moreover, an uncertainty-aware mechanism is incorporated in the loss functions to alleviate the interference of moving objects/noises. We evaluate our method's performances on two large-scale datasets, i.e., KITTI and Apollo-SouthBay. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods by 27%/32% in terms of translational/rotational errors on the KITTI dataset and also performs well on the Apollo-SouthBay dataset. By including more unlabelled training data, our method can further improve performance comparable to the supervised methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CoRL 2020</p></details> |

To do so, light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensor-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) technology have been elaborated. To compose a full SLAM system, many odometry and place recognition methods have independently been proposed in academia. However, they have hardly been integrated or too tightly combined so that exchanging (upgrading) either single odometry or place recognition module is very effort demanding. Recently, the performance of each module has been improved a lot, so it is necessary to build a SLAM system that can effectively integrate them and easily replace them with the latest one. In this paper, we release such a front-end agnostic LiDAR SLAM system, named SC-LiDAR-SLAM. We built a complete SLAM system by designing it modular, and successfully integrating it with Scan Context++ and diverse existing opensource LiDAR odometry methods to generate an accurate point cloud map</p></details> |  |

To this end, this paper presents a lightweight frontend LiDAR odometry solution with consistent and accurate localization for computationally-limited robotic platforms. Our Direct LiDAR Odometry (DLO) method includes several key algorithmic innovations which prioritize computational efficiency and enables the use of dense, minimally-preprocessed point clouds to provide accurate pose estimates in real-time. This is achieved through a novel keyframing system which efficiently manages historical map information, in addition to a custom iterative closest point solver for fast point cloud registration with data structure recycling. Our method is more accurate with lower computational overhead than the current state-of-the-art and has been extensively evaluated in multiple perceptually-challenging environments on aerial and legged robots as part of NASA JPL Team CoSTAR's research and development efforts for the DARPA Subterranean Challenge.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)</p></details> |

RailLoMer receives measurements from two LiDARs, an IMU, train odometer, and a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receiver. As frontend, the estimated motion from IMU/odometer preintegration de-skews the denoised point clouds and produces initial guess for frame-to-frame LiDAR odometry. As backend, a sliding window based factor graph is formulated to jointly optimize multi-modal information. In addition, we leverage the plane constraints from extracted rail tracks and the structure appearance descriptor to further improve the system robustness against repetitive structures. To ensure a globally-consistent and less blurry mapping result, we develop a two-stage mapping method that first performs scan-to-map in local scale, then utilizes the GNSS information to register the submaps. The proposed method is extensively evaluated on datasets gathered for a long time range over numerous scales and scenarios, and show that RailLoMer delivers decimeter-grade localization accuracy even in large or degenerated environments. We also integrate RailLoMer into an interactive train state and railway monitoring system prototype design, which has already been deployed to an experimental freight traffic railroad.</p></details> |  |

New methods regularly appear, proposing solutions ranging from small variations in classical algorithms to radically new paradigms based on deep learning. Yet it is often difficult to compare these methods, notably due to the few datasets on which the methods can be evaluated and compared. Furthermore, their weaknesses are rarely examined, often letting the user discover the hard way whether a method would be appropriate for a use case. In this paper, we review and organize the main 3D LiDAR odometries into distinct categories.

| **[LiDAR SLAMMOT based on Confidence-guided Data Association](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01041v1)** | 2024-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the field of autonomous driving or robotics, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and multi-object tracking (MOT) are two fundamental problems and are generally applied separately. Solutions to SLAM and MOT usually rely on certain assumptions, such as the static environment assumption for SLAM and the accurate ego-vehicle pose assumption for MOT. But in complex dynamic environments, it is difficult or even impossible to meet these assumptions. Therefore, the SLAMMOT, i.e., simultaneous localization, mapping, and moving object tracking, integrated system of SLAM and object tracking, has emerged for autonomous vehicles in dynamic environments. However, many conventional SLAMMOT solutions directly perform data association on the predictions and detections for object tracking, but ignore their quality. In practice, inaccurate predictions caused by continuous multi-frame missed detections in temporary occlusion scenarios, may degrade the performance of tracking, thereby affecting SLAMMOT. To address this challenge, this paper presents a LiDAR SLAMMOT based on confidence-guided data association (Conf SLAMMOT) method, which tightly couples the LiDAR SLAM and the confidence-guided data association based multi-object tracking into a graph optimization backend for estimating the state of the ego-vehicle and objects simultaneously. The confidence of prediction and detection are applied in the factor graph-based multi-object tracking for its data association, which not only avoids the performance degradation caused by incorrect initial assignments in some filter-based methods but also handles issues such as continuous missed detection in tracking while also improving the overall performance of SLAMMOT. Various comparative experiments demonstrate the superior advantages of Conf SLAMMOT, especially in scenes with some missed detections.</p></details> |  |
| **[Visual SLAMMOT Considering Multiple Motion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19134v1)** | 2024-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) are pivotal tasks in the realm of autonomous driving, attracting considerable research attention. While SLAM endeavors to generate real-time maps and determine the vehicle's pose in unfamiliar settings, MOT focuses on the real-time identification and tracking of multiple dynamic objects. Despite their importance, the prevalent approach treats SLAM and MOT as independent modules within an autonomous vehicle system, leading to inherent limitations. Classical SLAM methodologies often rely on a static environment assumption, suitable for indoor rather than dynamic outdoor scenarios. Conversely, conventional MOT techniques typically rely on the vehicle's known state, constraining the accuracy of object state estimations based on this prior. To address these challenges, previous efforts introduced the unified SLAMMOT paradigm, yet primarily focused on simplistic motion patterns. In our team's previous work IMM-SLAMMOT\cite{IMM-SLAMMOT}, we present a novel methodology incorporating consideration of multiple motion models into SLAMMOT i.e. tightly coupled SLAM and MOT, demonstrating its efficacy in LiDAR-based systems. This paper studies feasibility and advantages of instantiating this methodology as visual SLAMMOT, bridging the gap between LiDAR and vision-based sensing mechanisms. Specifically, we propose a solution of visual SLAMMOT considering multiple motion models and validate the inherent advantages of IMM-SLAMMOT in the visual domain.</p></details> |  |
| **[Communication-Efficient Cooperative SLAMMOT via Determining the Number of Collaboration Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17432v1)** | 2024-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The SLAMMOT, i.e. simultaneous localization, mapping, and moving object (detection and) tracking, represents an emerging technology for autonomous vehicles in dynamic environments. Such single-vehicle systems still have inherent limitations, such as occlusion issues. Inspired by SLAMMOT and rapidly evolving cooperative technologies, it is natural to explore cooperative simultaneous localization, mapping, moving object (detection and) tracking (C-SLAMMOT) to enhance state estimation for ego-vehicles and moving objects. C-SLAMMOT could significantly upgrade the single-vehicle performance by utilizing and integrating the shared information through communication among the multiple vehicles. This inevitably leads to a fundamental trade-off between performance and communication cost, especially in a scalable manner as the number of collaboration vehicles increases. To address this challenge, we propose a LiDAR-based communication-efficient C-SLAMMOT (CE C-SLAMMOT) method by determining the number of collaboration vehicles. In CE C-SLAMMOT, we adopt descriptor-based methods for enhancing ego-vehicle pose estimation and spatial confidence map-based methods for cooperative object perception, allowing for the continuous and dynamic selection of the corresponding critical collaboration vehicles and interaction content. This approach avoids the waste of precious communication costs by preventing the sharing of information from certain collaborative vehicles that may contribute little or no performance gain, compared to the baseline method of exchanging raw observation information among all vehicles. Comparative experiments in various aspects have confirmed that the proposed method achieves a good trade-off between performance and communication costs, while also outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in cooperative perception performance.</p></details> |  |

This system works with a heterogeneous system consisting of multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) to perform inspection and intervention tasks in GNSS-denied or interrupted environments. The carrier, an electric catamaran measuring 4m by 7m, features a 4m by 6m deck supporting automated takeoff and landing for four DJI M300 drones, along with a 10kg-payload manipulator operable in up to level 3 sea conditions. Utilizing an offshore gimbal camera for navigation, the carrier can autonomously navigate, approach and dock with non-cooperative vessels, guided by an onboard camera, LiDAR, and Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) over a 3 km$^2$ area. UAVs equipped with onboard Ultra-Wideband (UWB) technology execute mapping, detection, and manipulation tasks using a versatile gripper designed for wet, saline conditions. Additionally, two UAVs can coordinate to transport large objects to the manipulator or interact directly with them. These procedures are fully automated and were successfully demonstrated at the Mohammed Bin Zayed International Robotic Competition (MBZIRC2024), where the drone carrier equipped with four UAVS and one manipulator, automatically accomplished the intervention tasks in sea-level-3 (wave height 1.25m) based on the rough target information.</p></details> | 15 pages, 12pages |

Given the inherent limitations of standalone sensors, integrating heterogeneous sensors with complementary capabilities is one of the most effective approaches to achieving this goal. In this paper, we propose a filtering-based, tightly coupled global navigation satellite system (GNSS)-visual-inertial positioning framework with a pose-only formulation applied to the visual-inertial system (VINS), termed PO-GVINS. Specifically, multiple-view imaging used in current VINS requires a priori of 3D feature, then jointly estimate camera poses and 3D feature position, which inevitably introduces linearization error of the feature as well as facing dimensional explosion. However, the pose-only (PO) formulation, which is demonstrated to be equivalent to the multiple-view imaging and has been applied in visual reconstruction, represent feature depth using two camera poses and thus 3D feature position is removed from state vector avoiding aforementioned difficulties. Inspired by this, we first apply PO formulation in our VINS, i.e., PO-VINS. GNSS raw measurements are then incorporated with integer ambiguity resolved to achieve accurate and drift-free estimation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed PO-VINS significantly outperforms the multi-state constrained Kalman filter (MSCKF). By incorporating GNSS measurements, PO-GVINS achieves accurate, drift-free state estimation, making it a robust solution for positioning in challenging environments.</p></details> |  |

Despite their adaptability and efficiency, LLMs have not been extensively explored for signal processing tasks, particularly in the domain of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) interference monitoring. GNSS interference monitoring is essential to ensure the reliability of vehicle localization on roads, a critical requirement for numerous applications. However, GNSS-based positioning is vulnerable to interference from jamming devices, which can compromise its accuracy. The primary objective is to identify, classify, and mitigate these interferences. Interpreting GNSS snapshots and the associated interferences presents significant challenges due to the inherent complexity, including multipath effects, diverse interference types, varying sensor characteristics, and satellite constellations. In this paper, we extract features from a large GNSS dataset and employ LLaVA to retrieve relevant information from an extensive knowledge base. We employ prompt engineering to interpret the interferences and environmental factors, and utilize t-SNE to analyze the feature embeddings. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed method is capable of visual and logical reasoning within the GNSS context. Furthermore, our pipeline outperforms state-of-the-art machine learning models in interference classification tasks.</p></details> |  |

Recent studies have shown the significant advantages of the wheel-mounted inertial measurement unit (Wheel-IMU)-based dead reckoning system. However, it still drifts over extended periods because of the absence of external correction signals. To achieve the goal of long-term accurate localization, we propose Wheel-GINS, a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)/inertial navigation system (INS) integrated navigation system using a Wheel-IMU. Wheel-GINS fuses the GNSS position measurement with the Wheel-IMU via an extended Kalman filter to limit the long-term error drift and provide continuous state estimation when the GNSS signal is blocked. Considering the specificities of the GNSS/Wheel-IMU integration, we conduct detailed modeling and online estimation of the Wheel-IMU installation parameters, including the Wheel-IMU leverarm and mounting angle and the wheel radius error. Experimental results have shown that Wheel-GINS outperforms the traditional GNSS/Odometer/INS integrated navigation system during GNSS outages. At the same time, Wheel-GINS can effectively estimate the Wheel-IMU installation parameters online and, consequently, improve the localization accuracy and practicality of the system.

As the backbone for positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) across various applications including transportation, telecommunications, and emergency services GNSS is vulnerable to deliberate interference that poses significant risks. Spoofing attacks, which involve transmitting counterfeit GNSS signals to mislead receivers into calculating incorrect positions, can result in serious consequences, from navigational errors in civilian aviation to security breaches in military operations. Furthermore, the lack of inherent security measures within GNSS systems makes them attractive targets for adversaries. While GNSS/GPS jamming and spoofing systems consist of numerous components, the ability to distinguish authentic signals from malicious ones is essential for maintaining system integrity. Recent advancements in machine learning and deep learning provide promising avenues for enhancing detection and mitigation strategies against these threats. This paper addresses both spoofing and jamming by tackling real-world challenges through machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision techniques. Through extensive experiments on two real-world datasets related to spoofing and jamming detection using advanced algorithms, we achieved state of the art results. In the GNSS/GPS jamming detection task, we attained approximately 99% accuracy, improving performance by around 5% compared to previous studies. Additionally, we addressed a challenging tasks related to spoofing detection, yielding results that underscore the potential of machine learning and deep learning in this domain.</p></details> |  |

Each device trains the model on its local server and shares only the model updates (i.e., gradient weights) during the aggregation step. A significant challenge in FL is managing the feature distribution of novel and unbalanced data across devices. In this paper, we propose an FL approach using few-shot learning and aggregation of the model weights on a global server. We introduce a dynamic early stopping method to balance out-of-distribution classes based on representation learning, specifically utilizing the maximum mean discrepancy of feature embeddings between local and global models. An exemplary application of FL is to orchestrate machine learning models along highways for interference classification based on snapshots from global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receivers. Extensive experiments on four GNSS datasets from two real-world highways and controlled environments demonstrate that our FL method surpasses state-of-the-art techniques in adapting to both novel interference classes and multipath scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Git r...</summary><p>Git repository: https://gitlab.cc-asp.fraunhofer.de/darcy_gnss/federated_learning</p></details> |

While global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) provide low-cost and reliable positioning services, they are often hindered in complex urban canyon environments. Thus, exploring opportunistic signals for positioning in urban areas has become a key solution. Augmented reality (AR) allows pedestrians to acquire real-time visual information. Accordingly, we propose a low-cost visual-inertial positioning solution. This method comprises a lightweight multi-scale group convolution (MSGC)-based visual place recognition (VPR) neural network, a pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) algorithm, and a visual/inertial fusion approach based on a Kalman filter with gross error suppression. The VPR serves as a conditional observation to the Kalman filter, effectively correcting the errors accumulated through the PDR method. This enables the entire algorithm to ensure the reliability of long-term positioning in GNSS-denied areas. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method maintains stable positioning during large-scale movements. Compared to the lightweight MobileNetV3-based VPR method, our proposed VPR solution improves Recall@1 by at least 3\% on two public datasets while reducing the number of parameters by 63.37\%. It also achieves performance that is comparable to the VGG16-based method. The VPR-PDR algorithm improves localization accuracy by more than 40\% compared to the original PDR.</p></details> |  |

To address this, BEVRender generates high-quality local bird's-eye-view(BEV) images of the local terrain. Subsequently, these images are aligned with a geo referenced aerial map through template matching to achieve accurate cross-view registration. Our approach overcomes the inherent limitations of visual inertial odometry systems and the substantial storage requirements of image-retrieval localization strategies, which are susceptible to drift and scalability issues, respectively.

This work provides the necessary checks and synchronization protocols needed in the broadcast-only GNSS context. We provide proof of security for each of our algorithms under a delay-capable adversary. The algorithms included herein enable a GNSS receiver to use its onboard, GNSS-independent clock to determine whether a message arrived at the correct time, to determine whether its onboard, GNSS-independent clock is safe to use and when the clock will no longer be safe in the future due to predicted clock drift, and to resynchronize its onboard, GNSS-independent clock. Each algorithm is safe to use even when an adversary induces delays within the protocol. Moreover, we discuss the implications of GNSS authentication schemes that use two simultaneous TESLA instances of different authentication cadences. To a receiver implementer or standards author, this work provides the necessary implementation algorithms to assert security and provides a comprehensive guide on why these methods are required.</p></details> | 16 pages, 15 figures |

Traditional approaches often rely on intrusive and/or expensive external hardware sensors. These systems typically have limited spatial coverage. In response to these limitations, this work aims to investigate an unintrusive and cost-effective alternative for road user classification by using high-frequency (1-2 Hz) positional sequences. A cutting-edge solution could involve leveraging positioning data from 5G networks. However, this feature is currently only proposed in the 3GPP standard and has not yet been implemented for outdoor applications by 5G equipment vendors. Therefore, our approach relies on positional data, that is recorded under real-world conditions using Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and processed on distributed edge devices. As a start-ing point, four types of road users are distinguished: pedestri-ans, cyclists, motorcycles, and passenger cars. While earlier approaches used classical statistical methods, we propose Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks (RNNs) as the preferred classification method, as they repre-sent state-of-the-art in processing sequential data. An RNN architecture for road user classification, based on selected motion characteristics derived from raw positional sequences is presented and the influence of sequence length on classifica-tion quality is examined. The results of the work show that RNNs are capable of efficiently classifying road users on dis-tributed devices, and can particularly differentiate between types of motorized vehicles, based on two- to four-minute se-quences.</p></details> |  |

In these environments, characterized by weakly textured sea surfaces with few feature points, chaotic deck oscillations due to waves, and significant wind gusts, conventional navigation methods often prove inadequate. Leveraging the DJI M300 platform, our system is designed to autonomously navigate and transport cargo while overcoming these environmental challenges. In particular, this paper proposes an anchor-based localization method using ultrawideband (UWB) and QR codes facilities, which decouples the UAV's attitude from that of the moving landing platform, thus reducing control oscillations caused by platform movement. Additionally, a motor-driven attachment mechanism for cargo is designed, which enhances the UAV's field of view during descent and ensures a reliable attachment to the cargo upon landing. The system's reliability and effectiveness were progressively enhanced through multiple outdoor experimental iterations and were validated by the successful cargo transport during the 2024 Mohamed BinZayed International Robotics Challenge (MBZIRC2024) competition. Crucially, the system addresses uncertainties and interferences inherent in maritime transportation missions without prior knowledge of cargo locations on the deck and with strict limitations on intervention throughout the transportation.</p></details> |  |

Integrity monitoring (IM) capability is required when FGO-based integrated navigation system is used for safety-critical applications. However, traditional researches on IM of integrated navigation system are mostly based on Kalman filter. It is urgent to develop effective IM scheme for FGO-based GNSS/INS/Vision integration. In this contribution, the position error bounding formula to ensure the integrity of the GNSS/INS/Vision integration based on FGO is designed and validated for the first time. It can be calculated by the linearized equations from the residuals of GNSS pseudo-range, IMU pre-integration and visual measurements. The specific position error bounding is given in the case of GNSS, INS and visual measurement faults. Field experiments were conducted to evaluate and validate the performance of the proposed position error bounding. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed position error bounding for the GNSS/INS/Vision integration based on FGO can correctly fit the position error against different fault modes, and the availability of integrity in six fault modes is 100% after correct and timely fault exclusion.</p></details> |  |

But Europe identified GNSS for more applications and to be integrated in rail in general as part of the toolset to help railway to contribute to reduce transport carbon footprint. To increase the use of trains in European transports, railways must improve their attractiveness for passengers and freight, but also increase reliability, availability and efficiency by reducing capital expenditure and operational costs. GNSS is part of the global digitalization scheme of freight that aims to offer added value to the clients knowledge of accurate time of arrival, continuous monitoring of transport conditions (temperature, humidity...). But a major challenge will be to reach stringent applications and in particular, GNSS is today seen as a realistic and serious game changer for the future of the ERTMS (European Rail Traffic Management System). The localisation function is today performed with both odometry and balises. Odometer provides a continuous train position in time from a reference point. But as the distance delivered by the odometer shows a growing bias with distance, due to wear and wheel sliding, the use of on-track balises allows to reduce this error. Future systems will be based on on-board localisation solutions with GNSS receivers. It will allow the development of new concepts for moving blocks, virtual coupling and automation. Its use for train integrity is also investigated. But the environmental conditions of track and surroundings configuration, i.e, tunnels, dense urban areas or vegetation often degrade positioning performance and thus its efficiency and safety. Indeed, GNSS satellites are moving and their visibility (availability and relative position from the receiver) vary with time. Moreover, for optimal performance, the system requires open sky environments, which are the cases of most of the aeronautical uses but not of train uses. Trains often circulate in areas where signal reception can be disturbed (multipath, intentional or unintentional interferences) and thus, performances degraded. If many progresses have been made in the past years to develop more robust receivers [Puccitelli, 2022], multi-sensor solutions [CLUG website] or missing tools such as Digital Maps [Crespillo, 2023], in projects such as the Shift2Rail Project X2Rail-5 or CLUG, some questions remain and in particular related to performance evaluation. How can we evaluate performances in a dynamic environment (train, satellite, obstacles)? How can we be sure that every configuration has been tested? What is the impact of a failure (inaccuracy, missed detection) on operation? Some of these issues are addressed in the on-going R2DATO project funded by Europe's rail.</p></details> |  |
| **[Long-distance Geomagnetic Navigation in GNSS-denied Environments with Deep Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15837v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Geomagnetic navigation has drawn increasing attention with its capacity in navigating through complex environments and its independence from external navigation services like global navigation satellite systems (GNSS). Existing studies on geomagnetic navigation, i.e., matching navigation and bionic navigation, rely on pre-stored map or extensive searches, leading to limited applicability or reduced navigation efficiency in unexplored areas. To address the issues with geomagnetic navigation in areas where GNSS is unavailable, this paper develops a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based mechanism, especially for long-distance geomagnetic navigation. The designed mechanism trains an agent to learn and gain the magnetoreception capacity for geomagnetic navigation, rather than using any pre-stored map or extensive and expensive searching approaches. Particularly, we integrate the geomagnetic gradient-based parallel approach into geomagnetic navigation. This integration mitigates the over-exploration of the learning agent by adjusting the geomagnetic gradient, such that the obtained gradient is aligned towards the destination. We explore the effectiveness of the proposed approach via detailed numerical simulations, where we implement twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) in realizing the proposed approach. The results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing metaheuristic and bionic navigation methods in long-distance missions under diverse navigation conditions.</p></details> |  |

| **[Towards a Self-rescuing System for UAVs Under GNSS Attack](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02442v1)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There has been substantial growth in the UAV market along with an expansion in their applications. However, the successful execution of a UAV mission is very often dependent on the use of a GNSS. Unfortunately, the vulnerability of GNSS signals, due to their lack of encryption and authentication, poses a significant cybersecurity issue. This vulnerability makes various attacks, particularly the "GNSS spoofing attack," and "GNSS jamming attack" easily executable. Generally speaking, during this attack, the drone is manipulated into altering its path, usually resulting in an immediate forced landing or crash. As far as we know, we are the first to propose a lightweight-solution that enable a drone to autonomously rescue itself, assuming it is under GNSS attack and the GNSS is no longer available, and return safely to its initial takeoff position, thereby preventing any potential crashes. During the flight, wind plays a critical role as it can instantaneously alter the drone's position. To solve this problem, we have devised a highly effective 2-phases solution: (i) Forward Phase, for monitoring and recording the forward journey, and (ii) Backward Phase, that generates a backward route, based on the Forward Phase and wind presence. The final solution ensures strong performance in consistently returning the drone to the original position, even in wind situations, while maintaining a very fast computation time.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This article has been accepted for publication in the proceedings of the 2024 IEEE International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking And Communications (WiMob)</p></details> |
| **[Achieving Generalization in Orchestrating GNSS Interference Monitoring Stations Through Pseudo-Labeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14686v1)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The accuracy of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receivers is significantly compromised by interference from jamming devices. Consequently, the detection of these jammers are crucial to mitigating such interference signals. However, robust classification of interference using machine learning (ML) models is challenging due to the lack of labeled data in real-world environments. In this paper, we propose an ML approach that achieves high generalization in classifying interference through orchestrated monitoring stations deployed along highways. We present a semi-supervised approach coupled with an uncertainty-based voting mechanism by combining Monte Carlo and Deep Ensembles that effectively minimizes the requirement for labeled training samples to less than 5% of the dataset while improving adaptability across varying environments. Our method demonstrates strong performance when adapted from indoor environments to real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>DGON ...</summary><p>DGON Positioning and Navigation for Intelligent Transport Systems (POSNAV)</p></details> |
| **[Globally Optimal GNSS Multi-Antenna Lever Arm Calibration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09866v2)** | 2024-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sensor calibration is crucial for autonomous driving, providing the basis for accurate localization and consistent data fusion. Enabling the use of high-accuracy GNSS sensors, this work focuses on the antenna lever arm calibration. We propose a globally optimal multi-antenna lever arm calibration approach based on motion measurements. For this, we derive an optimization method that further allows the integration of a-priori knowledge. Globally optimal solutions are obtained by leveraging the Lagrangian dual problem and a primal recovery strategy. Generally, motion-based calibration for autonomous vehicles is known to be difficult due to cars' predominantly planar motion. Therefore, we first describe the motion requirements for a unique solution and then propose a planar motion extension to overcome this issue and enable a calibration based on the restricted motion of autonomous vehicles. Last we present and discuss the results of our thorough evaluation. Using simulated and augmented real-world data, we achieve accurate calibration results and fast run times that allow online deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating ML Robustness in GNSS Interference Classification, Characterization \& Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15114v1)** | 2024-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Jamming devices present a significant threat by disrupting signals from the global navigation satellite system (GNSS), compromising the robustness of accurate positioning. The detection of anomalies within frequency snapshots is crucial to counteract these interferences effectively. A critical preliminary measure involves the reliable classification of interferences and characterization and localization of jamming devices. This paper introduces an extensive dataset compromising snapshots obtained from a low-frequency antenna, capturing diverse generated interferences within a large-scale environment including controlled multipath effects. Our objective is to assess the resilience of ML models against environmental changes, such as multipath effects, variations in interference attributes, such as the interference class, bandwidth, and signal-to-noise ratio, the accuracy jamming device localization, and the constraints imposed by snapshot input lengths. By analyzing the aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, we demonstrate the adaptness of our model in generalizing across diverse facets, thus establishing its suitability for real-world applications. https://gitlab.cc-asp.fraunhofer.de/darcy_gnss/controlled_low_frequency</p></details> |  |

However, a significant technological disparity exists as traditional GNSS algorithms are often developed in Fortran or C, contrasting with the Python-based implementation prevalent in deep learning tools. To address this discrepancy, this paper introduces pyrtklib, a Python binding for the widely utilized open-source GNSS tool, RTKLIB. This binding makes all RTKLIB functionalities accessible in Python, facilitating seamless integration. Moreover, we present a deep learning subsystem under pyrtklib, which is a novel deep learning framework that leverages pyrtklib to accurately predict weights and biases within the GNSS positioning process. The use of pyrtklib enables developers to easily and quickly prototype and implement deep learning-aided GNSS algorithms, showcasing its potential to enhance positioning accuracy significantly.</p></details> |  |

In a tutorial and unified exposition, we recall the recent theory of two-frame systems within the field of invariant Kalman filtering. We then show how to adapt it geometrically to address the considered problem, although it seems at first sight out of its scope. This yields an invariant extended Kalman filter having autonomous error equations, and state-independent Jacobians, which is shown to work remarkably well in simulations. The proposed novel construction thus extends the application scope of invariant filtering.</p></details> |  |
| **[An innovation-based cycle-slip, multipath estimation, detection and mitigation method for tightly coupled GNSS/INS/Vision navigation in urban areas](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03433v1)** | 2024-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Precise, consistent, and reliable positioning is crucial for a multitude of uses. In order to achieve high precision global positioning services, multi-sensor fusion techniques, such as the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)/Inertial Navigation System (INS)/Vision integration system, combine the strengths of various sensors. This technique is essential for localization in complex environments and has been widely used in the mass market. However, frequent signal deterioration and blocking in urban environments exacerbates the degradation of GNSS positioning and negatively impacts the performance of the multi-sensor integration system. For GNSS pseudorange and carrier phase observation data in the urban environment, we offer an innovation-based cycle slip/multipath estimation, detection, and mitigation (I-EDM) method to reduce the influence of multipath effects and cycle slips on location induced by obstruction in urban settings. The method obtains the innovations of GNSS observations with the cluster analysis method. Then the innovations are used to detect the cycle slips and multipath. Compared with the residual-based method, the innovation-based method avoids the residual overfitting caused by the least square method, resulting in better detection of outliers within the GNSS observations. The vehicle tests carried out in urban settings verify the proposed approach. Experimental results indicate that the accuracy of 0.23m, 0.11m, and 0.31m in the east, north and up components can be achieved by the GNSS/INS/Vision tightly coupled system with the I-EDM method, which has a maximum of 21.6% improvement when compared with the residual-based EDM (R-EDM) method.</p></details> |  |

However, in complex urban canyon environments, the vulnerability of a stand-alone sensor and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) caused by high buildings, trees, and elevated structures seriously affect positioning results. To address these challenges, a sky-view images segmentation algorithm based on Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) is proposed for GNSS NLOS detection. Building upon this, a novel NLOS detection and mitigation algorithm (named S-NDM) is extended to the tightly coupled Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), Inertial Measurement Units (IMU), and visual feature system which is called Sky-GVIO, with the aim of achieving continuous and accurate positioning in urban canyon environments. Furthermore, the system harmonizes Single Point Positioning (SPP) with Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) methodologies to bolster its operational versatility and resilience. In urban canyon environments, the positioning performance of S-NDM algorithm proposed in this paper is evaluated under different tightly coupled SPP-related and RTK-related models. The results exhibit that Sky-GVIO system achieves meter-level accuracy under SPP mode and sub-decimeter precision with RTK, surpassing the performance of GNSS/INS/Vision frameworks devoid of S-NDM. Additionally, the sky-view image dataset, inclusive of training and evaluation subsets, has been made publicly accessible for scholarly exploration at https://github.com/whuwangjr/sky-view-images .</p></details> |  |

Both require spatial models for effective route planning and localization. This paper addresses the challenge of road graph construction for autonomous vehicles. Despite recent advances, creating a road graph remains labor-intensive and has yet to achieve full automation. The goal of this paper is to generate such graphs automatically and accurately. Modern cars are equipped with onboard sensors used for today's advanced driver assistance systems like lane keeping. We propose using global navigation satellite system (GNSS) traces and basic image data acquired from these standard sensors in consumer vehicles to estimate road-level maps with minimal effort. We exploit the spatial information in the data by framing the problem as a road centerline semantic segmentation task using a convolutional neural network. We also utilize the data's time series nature to refine the neural network's output by using map matching. We implemented and evaluated our method using a fleet of real consumer vehicles, only using the deployed onboard sensors. Our evaluation demonstrates that our approach not only matches existing methods on simpler road configurations but also significantly outperforms them on more complex road geometries and topologies.

Sensors are often corrupted in those complicated and large-scale environments. This paper introduces GNSS-FGO, an online and global trajectory estimator that fuses GNSS observations alongside multiple sensor measurements for robust vehicle localization. In GNSS-FGO, we fuse asynchronous sensor measurements into the graph with a continuous-time trajectory representation using Gaussian process regression. This enables querying states at arbitrary timestamps so that sensor observations are fused without requiring strict state and measurement synchronization. Thus, the proposed method presents a generalized factor graph for multi-sensor fusion. To evaluate and study different GNSS fusion strategies, we fuse GNSS measurements in loose and tight coupling with a speed sensor, IMU, and lidar-odometry. We employed datasets from measurement campaigns in Aachen, Duesseldorf, and Cologne in experimental studies and presented comprehensive discussions on sensor observations, smoother types, and hyperparameter tuning. Our results show that the proposed approach enables robust trajectory estimation in dense urban areas, where the classic multi-sensor fusion method fails due to sensor degradation. In a test sequence containing a 17km route through Aachen, the proposed method results in a mean 2D positioning error of 0.48m while fusing raw GNSS observations with lidar odometry in a tight coupling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the IEEE Transactions on Robotics</p></details> |
| **[FE-GUT: Factor Graph Optimization hybrid with Extended Kalman Filter for tightly coupled GNSS/UWB Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06915v1)** | 2024-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Precise positioning and navigation information has been increasingly important with the development of the consumer electronics market. Due to some deficits of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), such as susceptible to interferences, integrating of GNSS with additional alternative sensors is a promising approach to overcome the performance limitations of GNSS-based localization systems. Ultra-Wideband (UWB) can be used to enhance GNSS in constructing an integrated localization system. However, most low-cost UWB devices lack a hardware-level time synchronization feature, which necessitates the estimation and compensation of the time-offset in the tightly coupled GNSS/UWB integration. Given the flexibility of probabilistic graphical models, the time-offset can be modeled as an invariant constant in the discretization of the continuous model. This work proposes a novel architecture in which Factor Graph Optimization (FGO) is hybrid with Extend Kalman Filter (EKF) for tightly coupled GNSS/UWB integration with online Temporal calibration (FE-GUT). FGO is utilized to precisely estimate the time-offset, while EKF provides initailization for the new factors and performs time-offset compensation. Simulation-based experiments validate the integrated localization performance of FE-GUT. In a four-wheeled robot scenario, the results demonstrate that, compared to EKF, FE-GUT can improve horizontal and vertical localization accuracy by 58.59\% and 34.80\%, respectively, while the time-offset estimation accuracy is improved by 76.80\%.

This paper proposes a minimalist approach exploiting track geometry and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensor data. By integrating a discrete track map as a Look-Up Table (LUT) into a Particle Filter (PF) based solution, accurate train positioning is achieved with only an IMU sensor and track map data. The approach is tested on an open railway positioning data set, showing that accurate positioning (absolute errors below 10 m) can be maintained during GNSS outages up to 30 s in the given data. We simulate outages on different track segments and show that accurate positioning is reached during track curves and curvy railway lines. The approach can be used as a redundant complement to established positioning solutions to increase the position estimate's reliability and robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 10 figures, accepted to 27th International Conference on Information Fusion (FUSION 2024)</p></details> |

In this paper, we develop a novel GNSS-Visual-Inertial Navigation System (GVINS) that fuses visual, inertial, and raw GNSS measurements within the square-root inverse sliding window filtering (SRI-SWF) framework in a tightly coupled fashion, which thus is termed SRI-GVINS. In particular, for the first time, we deeply fuse the GNSS pseudorange, Doppler shift, single-differenced pseudorange, and double-differenced carrier phase measurements, along with the visual-inertial measurements. Inherited from the SRI-SWF, the proposed SRI-GVINS gains significant numerical stability and computational efficiency over the start-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we propose to use a filter to sequentially initialize the reference frame transformation till converges, rather than collecting measurements for batch optimization. We also perform online calibration of GNSS-IMU extrinsic parameters to mitigate the possible extrinsic parameter degradation. The proposed SRI-GVINS is extensively evaluated on our own collected UAV datasets and the results demonstrate that the proposed method is able to suppress VIO drift in real-time and also show the effectiveness of online GNSS-IMU extrinsic calibration. The experimental validation on the public datasets further reveals that the proposed SRI-GVINS outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.</p></details> |  |

Due to the low GNSS received signal power, even low-power radiofrequency interference (RFI) sources are a serious threat to the GNSS integrity and availability. Nonetheless, RFI source localization is paramount yet hard, especially over large areas. Methods based on multi-rotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) exist but are often limited by hovering time, and require specific antenna and detectors. In comparison, fixed-wing planes allow longer missions but are more complex to operate and deploy. A vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) UAV combines the positive aspects of both platforms: high maneuverability, and long mission time and, jointly with highly integrated control systems, simple operation and deployment. Building upon the flexibility allowed by such a platform, we propose a method that combines advanced flight dynamics with high-performance consumer receivers to detect interference over large areas, with minimal interaction with the operator. The proposed system can detect multiple interference sources and map their area of influence, gaining situational awareness of poor GNSS quality or denied environments. Furthermore, it can estimate the relative heading and position of the interference source within tens of meters. The proposed method is validated with real-life measurements, successfully mapping two interference-affected areas and exposing radio equipment causing involuntary in-band interference.</p></details> | <details><summary>In pr...</summary><p>In proceedings of the 2024 IEEE Aerospace Conference (AeroConf)</p></details> |

Detecting anomalies in frequency snapshots is crucial to counteract these interferences effectively. The ability to adapt to diverse, unseen interference characteristics is essential for ensuring the reliability of GNSS in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a few-shot learning (FSL) approach to adapt to new interference classes. Our method employs quadruplet selection for the model to learn representations using various positive and negative interference classes. Furthermore, our quadruplet variant selects pairs based on the aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty to differentiate between similar classes. We recorded a dataset at a motorway with eight interference classes on which our FSL method with quadruplet loss outperforms other FSL techniques in jammer classification accuracy with 97.66%.

Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) provides the foundation for absolute positioning. Recently enhanced Precise Point Positioning (PPP) technology now offers corrections for GNSS on a global scale, with the potential to achieve accuracy suitable for real-time CAV applications. However, in obstructed sky conditions, GNSS signals are often affected by outliers; therefore, addressing outliers is crucial. In GNSS applications, there are many more measurements available than are required to meet the specification. Therefore, selecting measurements to avoid outliers is of interest. The recently developed Risk-Averse Performance-Specified (RAPS) state estimation optimally selects measurements to minimize outlier risk while meeting a positive semi-definite constraint on performance; at present, the existing solution methods are not suitable for real-time computation and have not been demonstrated using challenging real-world data or in Real-time PPP (RT-PPP) applications. This article makes contributions in a few directions. First, it uses a diagonal performance specification, which reduces computational costs relative to the positive semi-definite constraint. Second, this article considers GNSS RT-PPP applications. Third, the experiments use real-world GNSS data collected in challenging environments. The RT-PPP experimental results show that among the compared methods: all achieve comparable performance in open-sky conditions, and all exceed the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) specification; however, in challenging environments, the diagonal RAPS approach shows improvement of 6-19% over traditional methods. Throughout, RAPS achieves the lowest estimation risk.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages,2 figures, Accepted by 2024 American Control Conference</p></details> |

The Slant Total Electron Contents (STEC) is an important parameter for characterizing wave propagation, representing the integrated electron density along the ray of radio signals passing through the ionosphere. The accurate prediction of STEC is essential for mitigating the ionospheric impact particularly on Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). In this work, we propose a high-precision STEC prediction model named DeepONet-STEC, which learns nonlinear operators to predict the 4D temporal-spatial integrated parameter for specified ground station - satellite ray path globally. As a demonstration, we validate the performance of the model based on GNSS observation data for global and US-CORS regimes under ionospheric quiet and storm conditions. The DeepONet-STEC model results show that the three-day 72 hour prediction in quiet periods could achieve high accuracy using observation data by the Precise Point Positioning (PPP) with temporal resolution 30s. Under active solar magnetic storm periods, the DeepONet-STEC also demonstrated its robustness and superiority than traditional deep learning methods. This work presents a neural operator regression architecture for predicting the 4D temporal-spatial ionospheric parameter for satellite navigation system performance, which may be further extended for various space applications and beyond.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multiple Update Particle Filter: Position Estimation by Combining GNSS Pseudorange and Carrier Phase Observations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03394v1)** | 2024-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents an efficient method for updating particles in a particle filter (PF) to address the position estimation problem when dealing with sharp-peaked likelihood functions derived from multiple observations. Sharp-peaked likelihood functions commonly arise from millimeter-accurate distance observations of carrier phases in the global navigation satellite system (GNSS). However, when such likelihood functions are used for particle weight updates, the absence of particles within the peaks leads to all particle weights becoming zero. To overcome this problem, in this study, a straightforward and effective approach is introduced for updating particles when dealing with sharp-peaked likelihood functions obtained from multiple observations. The proposed method, termed as the multiple update PF, leverages prior knowledge regarding the spread of distribution for each likelihood function and conducts weight updates and resampling iteratively in the particle update process, prioritizing the likelihood function spreads. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method, particularly when applied to position estimation utilizing GNSS pseudorange and carrier phase observations. The multiple update PF exhibits faster convergence with fewer particles when compared to the conventional PF. Moreover, vehicle position estimation experiments conducted in urban environments reveal that the proposed method outperforms conventional GNSS positioning techniques, yielding more accurate position estimates.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 2024 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA 2024)</p></details> |
| **[GNSS Positioning using Cost Function Regulated Multilateration and Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18630v1)** | 2024-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In urban environments, where line-of-sight signals from GNSS satellites are frequently blocked by high-rise objects, GNSS receivers are subject to large errors in measuring satellite ranges. Heuristic methods are commonly used to estimate these errors and reduce the impact of noisy measurements on localization accuracy. In our work, we replace these error estimation heuristics with a deep learning model based on Graph Neural Networks. Additionally, by analyzing the cost function of the multilateration process, we derive an optimal method to utilize the estimated errors. Our approach guarantees that the multilateration converges to the receiver's location as the error estimation accuracy increases. We evaluate our solution on a real-world dataset containing more than 100k GNSS epochs, collected from multiple cities with diverse characteristics. The empirical results show improvements from 40% to 80% in the horizontal localization error against recent deep learning baselines as well as classical localization approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in The Proceedings of the Institute of Navigation GNSS+ 2023</p></details> |
| **[Angle Robustness Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Navigation in GNSS-Denied Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02405v1)** | 2024-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the inability to receive signals from the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) in extreme conditions, achieving accurate and robust navigation for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is a challenging task. Recently emerged, vision-based navigation has been a promising and feasible alternative to GNSS-based navigation. However, existing vision-based techniques are inadequate in addressing flight deviation caused by environmental disturbances and inaccurate position predictions in practical settings. In this paper, we present a novel angle robustness navigation paradigm to deal with flight deviation in point-to-point navigation tasks. Additionally, we propose a model that includes the Adaptive Feature Enhance Module, Cross-knowledge Attention-guided Module and Robust Task-oriented Head Module to accurately predict direction angles for high-precision navigation. To evaluate the vision-based navigation methods, we collect a new dataset termed as UAV_AR368. Furthermore, we design the Simulation Flight Testing Instrument (SFTI) using Google Earth to simulate different flight environments, thereby reducing the expenses associated with real flight testing. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art by achieving improvements of 26.0% and 45.6% in the success rate of arrival under ideal and disturbed circumstances, respectively.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Mobile robot localization with GNSS multipath detection using pseudorange residuals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08054v1)** | 2024-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a novel positioning technique suitable for use in mobile robots in urban environments in which large global navigation satellite system (GNSS) positioning errors occur because of multipath signals. During GNSS positioning, the GNSS satellites that are obstructed by buildings emit reflection and diffraction signals, which are called non-line-of-sight (NLOS) multipath signals. These multipath signals cause major positioning errors. The key concept considered in this paper is the estimation of a user's position using the likelihood of the position hypotheses computed from the GNSS pseudoranges, consisting only of LOS signals based on the analysis of the pseudorange residuals. To determine the NLOS GNSS signals from the pseudorange residuals at the user's position, it is necessary to accurately determine the position before the computation of the pseudorange residuals. This problem is solved using a particle filter. We propose a likelihood estimation method using the Mahalanobis distance between the hypotheses of the user's position computed from only the LOS pseudoranges and the particles. To confirm the effectiveness of the proposed technique, a positioning test was performed in a real-world urban environment. The results demonstrated that the proposed method is effective for accurately estimating the user's position in urban canyons.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an electronic version of an article published in ADVANCED ROBOTICS, 33(12):602-613, 2019.

| **[Experimental Validation of Sensor Fusion-based GNSS Spoofing Attack Detection Framework for Autonomous Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01304v1)** | 2024-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we validate the performance of the a sensor fusion-based Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) spoofing attack detection framework for Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). To collect data, a vehicle equipped with a GNSS receiver, along with Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) is used. The detection framework incorporates two strategies: The first strategy involves comparing the predicted location shift, which is the distance traveled between two consecutive timestamps, with the inertial sensor-based location shift. For this purpose, data from low-cost in-vehicle inertial sensors such as the accelerometer and gyroscope sensor are fused and fed into a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network. The second strategy employs a Random-Forest supervised machine learning model to detect and classify turns, distinguishing between left and right turns using the output from the steering angle sensor. In experiments, two types of spoofing attack models: turn-by-turn and wrong turn are simulated. These spoofing attacks are modeled as SQL injection attacks, where, upon successful implementation, the navigation system perceives injected spoofed location information as legitimate while being unable to detect legitimate GNSS signals. Importantly, the IMU data remains uncompromised throughout the spoofing attack. To test the effectiveness of the detection framework, experiments are conducted in Tuscaloosa, AL, mimicking urban road structures. The results demonstrate the framework's ability to detect various sophisticated GNSS spoofing attacks, even including slow position drifting attacks. Overall, the experimental results showcase the robustness and efficacy of the sensor fusion-based spoofing attack detection approach in safeguarding AVs against GNSS spoofing threats.</p></details> |  |

A satellite-wise Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) is designed to regress the pseudorange bias correction from six satellite, receiver, context-related features derived from Android raw Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) measurements. To train the MLP, we carefully calculate the target values of pseudorange bias using location ground truth and smoothing techniques and optimize a loss function involving the estimation residuals of smartphone clock bias. The corrected pseudoranges are then used by a model-based localization engine to compute locations. The Google Smartphone Decimeter Challenge (GSDC) dataset, which contains Android smartphone data collected from both rural and urban areas, is utilized for evaluation. Both fingerprinting and cross-trace localization results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms model-based and state-of-the-art data-driven approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attitude-Estimation-Free GNSS and IMU Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10142v2)** | 2023-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A global navigation satellite system (GNSS) is a sensor that can acquire 3D position and velocity in an earth-fixed coordinate system and is widely used for outdoor position estimation of robots and vehicles. Various GNSS/inertial measurement unit (IMU) integration methods have been proposed to improve the accuracy and availability of GNSS positioning. However, all these methods require the addition of a 3D attitude to the estimated state to fuse the IMU data. In this study, we propose a new optimization-based positioning method for combining GNSS and IMU that does not require attitude estimation. The proposed method uses two types of constraints: one is a constraint between states using only the magnitude of the 3D acceleration observed by an accelerometer, and the other is a constraint on the angle between the velocity vectors using the angular change measured by a gyroscope. The evaluation results with the simulation data show that the proposed method maintains the position estimation accuracy even when the IMU mounting position error increases and improves the accuracy when the GNSS observations contain multipath errors or missing data. The proposed method could improve positioning accuracy in experiments using IMUs acquired in real environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)</p></details> |

This method using differential equations is very accurate for very small distances on the surface of the earth in the 1500km range of the Indian subcontinent satellite coverage. When we talk of accuracy of the GPS system it should be very accurate on the surface of the earth when used to show changes in coordinate of the moving body with respect to the ground by the satellite which is situated on the earths orbit. Optical flow is a method which uses movements with respect to x and y axis for infinitesimal changes in its coordinates and then uses this algorithm to use it in global positioning system to find accurate position of the body with respect to the satellite coordinates with respect to ground positioning. The modern method of differential frames is also very accurate as it involves infinitesimal frames which are modelled together from the satellite to find changes in the coordinates on the earths surface, so we have designed a new algorithm in this paper on the Optical flow GNSS system which is an alternative and can improve the study done in the design of these algorithms in this field of applications.</p></details> |  |

We focus on the automatic operation of articulated six-wheel dump trucks at construction sites. For the automatic operation of the dump trucks, it is important to estimate the position and the articulated angle of the dump trucks with high accuracy. In this study, we propose a method for estimating the state of a dump truck by using four global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs) installed on an articulated dump truck and a graph optimization method that utilizes the redundancy of multiple GNSSs. By adding real-time kinematic (RTK)-GNSS constraints and geometric constraints between the four antennas, the proposed method can robustly estimate the position and articulation angle even in environments where GNSS satellites are partially blocked. As a result of evaluating the accuracy of the proposed method through field tests, it was confirmed that the articulated angle could be estimated with an accuracy of 0.1$^\circ$ in an open-sky environment and 0.7$^\circ$ in a mountainous area simulating an elevation angle of 45$^\circ$ where GNSS satellites are blocked.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an electronic version of an article published in ADVANCED ROBOTICS, 35:23, 1376-1387, 2021.

| **[Robust UAV Position and Attitude Estimation using Multiple GNSS Receivers for Laser-based 3D Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02485v1)** | 2023-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Small-sized unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely investigated for use in a variety of applications such as remote sensing and aerial surveying. Direct three-dimensional (3D) mapping using a small-sized UAV equipped with a laser scanner is required for numerous remote sensing applications. In direct 3D mapping, the precise information about the position and attitude of the UAV is necessary for constructing 3D maps. In this study, we propose a novel and robust technique for estimating the position and attitude of small-sized UAVs by employing multiple low-cost and light-weight global navigation satellite system (GNSS) antennas/receivers. Using the "redundancy" of multiple GNSS receivers, we enhance the performance of real-time kinematic (RTK)-GNSS by employing single-frequency GNSS receivers. This method consists of two approaches: hybrid GNSS fix solutions and consistency examination of the GNSS signal strength. The fix rate of RTK-GNSS using single-frequency GNSS receivers can be highly enhanced to combine multiple RTK-GNSS to fix solutions in the multiple antennas. In addition, positioning accuracy and fix rate can be further enhanced to detect multipath signals by using multiple GNSS antennas. In this study, we developed a prototype UAV that is equipped with six GNSS antennas/receivers. From the static test results, we conclude that the proposed technique can enhance the accuracy of the position and attitude estimation in multipath environments. From the flight test, the proposed system could generate a 3D map with an accuracy of 5 cm.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) 2019</p></details> |

The global navigation satellite system (GNSS) has recently been used to estimate the absolute 3D position of outdoor mobile robots. However, since the accuracy of GNSS single-point positioning is only a few meters, the GNSS is not used for the loop closure of a pose graph. The main purpose of this study is to generate a loop closure of a pose graph using a time-relative real-time kinematic GNSS (TR-RTK-GNSS) technique. The proposed TR-RTK-GNSS technique uses time-differential carrier phase positioning, which is based on carrier-phase-based differential GNSS with a single GNSS receiver. Unlike a conventional RTK-GNSS, we can directly compute the robot's relative position using only a stand-alone GNSS receiver. The initial pose graph is generated from the accumulated velocity computed from GNSS Doppler measurements. To reduce the accumulated error of velocity, we use the TR-RTK-GNSS technique for the loop closure in the graph-based optimization framework. The kinematic positioning tests were performed using an unmanned aerial vehicle to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed technique. From the tests, we can estimate the vehicle's trajectory with approximately 3 cm accuracy using only a stand-alone GNSS receiver.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L) and presented at the IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), 2020</p></details> |
| **[GNSS Odometry: Precise Trajectory Estimation Based on Carrier Phase Cycle Slip Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02424v1)** | 2023-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a highly accurate trajectory estimation method for outdoor mobile robots using global navigation satellite system (GNSS) time differences of carrier phase (TDCP) measurements. By using GNSS TDCP, the relative 3D position can be estimated with millimeter precision. However, when a phenomenon called cycle slip occurs, wherein the carrier phase measurement jumps and becomes discontinuous, it is impossible to accurately estimate the relative position using TDCP. Although previous studies have eliminated the effect of cycle slip using a robust optimization technique, it was difficult to completely eliminate the effect of outliers. In this paper, we propose a method to detect GNSS carrier phase cycle slip, estimate the amount of cycle slip, and modify the observed TDCP to calculate the relative position using the factor graph optimization framework. The estimated relative position acts as a loop closure in graph optimization and contributes to the reduction in the integration error of the relative position. Experiments with an unmanned aerial vehicle showed that by modifying the cycle slip using the proposed method, the vehicle trajectory could be estimated with an accuracy of 5 to 30 cm using only a single GNSS receiver, without using any other external data or sensors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L) and presented at the IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), 2022</p></details> |
| **[Clifford Algebra-Based Iterated Extended Kalman Filter with Application to Low-Cost INS/GNSS Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07049v2)** | 2023-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The traditional GNSS-aided inertial navigation system (INS) usually exploits the extended Kalman filter (EKF) for state estimation, and the initial attitude accuracy is key to the filtering performance. To spare the reliance on the initial attitude, this work generalizes the previously proposed trident quaternion within the framework of Clifford algebra to represent the extended pose, IMU biases and lever arms on the Lie group. Consequently, a quasi-group-affine system is established for the low-cost INS/GNSS integrated navigation system, and the right-error Clifford algebra-based EKF (Clifford-RQEKF) is accordingly developed. The iterated filtering approach is further applied to significantly improve the performances of the Clifford-RQEKF and the previously proposed trident quaternion-based EKFs. Numerical simulations and experiments show that all iterated filtering approaches fulfill the fast and global convergence without the prior attitude information, whereas the iterated Clifford-RQEKF performs much better than the others under especially large IMU biases.</p></details> |  |

In recent years, the integration of the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), Inertial Navigation System (INS), and camera has garnered considerable attention due to its robustness and high accuracy in diverse environments. However, leveraging the full capacity of GNSS is cumbersome because of the diverse choices of formulations, error models, satellite constellations, signal frequencies, and service types, which lead to different precision, robustness, and usage dependencies. To clarify the capacity of GNSS algorithms and accelerate the development efficiency of employing GNSS in multi-sensor fusion algorithms, we open source the GNSS/INS/Camera Integration Library (GICI-LIB), together with detailed documentation and a comprehensive land vehicle dataset. A factor graph optimization-based multi-sensor fusion framework is established, which combines almost all GNSS measurement error sources by fully considering temporal and spatial correlations between measurements. The graph structure is designed for flexibility, making it easy to form any kind of integration algorithm. For illustration, Real-Time Kinematic (RTK), Precise Point Positioning (PPP), and four RTK-based algorithms from GICI-LIB are evaluated using our dataset and public datasets.

It can lead to loss of assets, inaccurate fare estimation, enforcing the wrong speed limit, miscalculated toll tax, passengers reaching an incorrect location, etc. The techniques designed to prevent and detect spoofing by using cryptographic solutions or receivers capable of differentiating legitimate and attack signals are insufficient in detecting GNSS spoofing of road users. Recent studies, testbeds, and 3GPP standards are exploring the possibility of hybrid positioning, where GNSS data will be combined with the 5G-NR positioning to increase the security and accuracy of positioning. We design the Location Estimation and Recovery(LER) systems to estimate the correct absolute position using the combination of GNSS and 5G positioning with other road users, where a subset of road users can be malicious and collude to prevent spoofing detection. Our Location Verification Protocol extends the understanding of Message Time of Arrival Codes (MTAC) to prevent attacks against malicious provers. The novel Recovery and Meta Protocol uses road users' dynamic and unpredictable nature to detect GNSS spoofing. This protocol provides fast detection of GNSS spoofing with a very low rate of false positives and can be customized to a large family of settings. Even in a (highly unrealistic) worst-case scenario where each user is malicious with a probability of as large as 0.3, our protocol detects GNSS spoofing with high probability after communication and ranging with at most 20 road users, with a false positive rate close to 0. SUMO simulations for road traffic show that we can detect GNSS spoofing in 2.6 minutes since its start under moderate traffic conditions.</p></details> |  |

Traditional state-of-the-art estimation methods, e.g., the multiplicative Kalman filter (MEKF), have some limitations concerning their consistency, errors in the initial state estimate, and convergence performance. Symmetry-based methods, such as the equivariant filter (EqF), offer significant advantages for these points by exploiting the mathematical properties of the system - its symmetry. These filters yield faster convergence rates and robustness to wrong initial state estimates through their error definition. To demonstrate the usability of EqFs, we focus on the sensor-fusion problem with the most common sensors in outdoor robotics: global navigation satellite system (GNSS) sensors and an inertial measurement unit (IMU). We provide an implementation of such an EqF leveraging the semi-direct product of the symmetry group to derive the filter equations. To validate the practical usability of EqFs in real-world scenarios, we evaluate our method using data from all outdoor runs of the INSANE Dataset. Our results demonstrate the performance improvements of the EqF in real-world environments, highlighting its potential for enhancing state estimation for UAVs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pre-p...</summary><p>Pre-print version, accepted to IEEE ICAR 2023</p></details> |

To address this need, we present a novel multi-LiDAR dataset specifically designed for UAV tracking. Our dataset includes data from a spinning LiDAR, two solid-state LiDARs with different Field of View (FoV) and scan patterns, and an RGB-D camera. This diverse sensor suite allows for research on new challenges in the field, including limited FoV adaptability and multi-modality data processing. The dataset facilitates the evaluation of existing algorithms and the development of new ones, paving the way for advances in UAV tracking techniques. Notably, we provide data in both indoor and outdoor environments. We also consider variable UAV sizes, from micro-aerial vehicles to more standard commercial UAV platforms. The outdoor trajectories are selected with close proximity to buildings, targeting research in UAV detection in urban areas, e.g., within counter-UAV systems or docking for UAV logistics. In addition to the dataset, we provide a baseline comparison with recent LiDAR-based UAV tracking algorithms, benchmarking the performance with different sensors, UAVs, and algorithms. Importantly, our dataset shows that current methods have shortcomings and are unable to track UAVs consistently across different scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, GNSS observations can be distorted due to multipath effects and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) receptions in challenging environments such as urban canyons. In such cases, traditional methods to classify and exclude faulty GNSS observations may fail, leading to unreliable state estimation and unsafe system operations. This work proposes a deep-learning-based method to detect NLOS receptions and predict GNSS pseudorange errors by analyzing GNSS observations as a spatio-temporal modeling problem. Compared to previous works, we construct a transformer-like attention mechanism to enhance the long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, improving model performance and generalization. For the training and evaluation of the proposed network, we used labeled datasets from the cities of Hong Kong and Aachen. We also introduce a dataset generation process to label the GNSS observations using lidar maps. In experimental studies, we compare the proposed network with a deep-learning-based model and classical machine-learning models. Furthermore, we conduct ablation studies of our network components and integrate the NLOS detection with data out-of-distribution in a state estimator. As a result, our network presents improved precision and recall ratios compared to other models. Additionally, we show that the proposed method avoids trajectory divergence in real-world vehicle localization by classifying and excluding NLOS observations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for the IEEE ITSC2023</p></details> |

In parallel to boosting the transition to zero-carbon cars, there is an increasing interest in low-cost instruments for precise measurement of the environmental impact of the many internal combustion engine vehicles still in circulation. The main contribution of this work is the design and comparison of two innovative black-box algorithms, one based on a reduced complexity physics modeling while the other relying on a feedforward neural network for black-box fuel consumption estimation using only velocity and acceleration measurements. Based on suitable metrics, the developed algorithms outperform the state of the art best approach, both in the instantaneous and in the integral fuel consumption estimation, with errors smaller than 1\% with respect to the fuel flow ground truth. The data used for model identification, testing, and experimental validation is composed of GNSS velocity and IMU acceleration measurements collected during several trips using a diesel fuel vehicle on different roads, in different seasons, and with varying numbers of passengers. Compared to built-in vehicle monitoring systems, this methodology is not customized, uses off-the-shelf sensors, and is based on two simple algorithms that have been validated offline and could be easily implemented in a real-time environment.</p></details> |  |

However, conducting real-time forest inventory in large-scale and GNSS-interrupted forest environments has long been a formidable challenge. In this paper, we present a novel solution that leverages robotics and sensor-fusion technologies to overcome these challenges and enable real-time forest inventory with higher accuracy and efficiency. The proposed solution consists of a new SLAM algorithm to create an accurate 3D map of large-scale forest stands with detailed estimation about the number of trees and the corresponding DBH, solely with the consecutive scans of a 3D lidar and an imu. This method utilized a hierarchical unsupervised clustering algorithm to detect the trees and measure the DBH from the lidar point cloud. The algorithm can run simultaneously as the data is being recorded or afterwards on the recorded dataset. Furthermore, due to the proposed fast feature extraction and transform estimation modules, the recorded data can be fed to the SLAM with higher frequency than common SLAM algorithms. The performance of the proposed solution was tested through filed data collection with hand-held sensor platform as well as a mobile forestry robot. The accuracy of the results was also compared to the state-of-the-art SLAM solutions.</p></details> |  |

| **[A Robust Localization Solution for an Uncrewed Ground Vehicle in Unstructured Outdoor GNSS-Denied Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02569v1)** | 2023-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work addresses the challenge of developing a localization system for an uncrewed ground vehicle (UGV) operating autonomously in unstructured outdoor Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-denied environments. The goal is to enable accurate mapping and long-range navigation with practical applications in domains such as autonomous construction, military engineering missions, and exploration of non-Earth planets. The proposed system - Terrain-Referenced Assured Engineer Localization System (TRAELS) - integrates pose estimates produced by two complementary terrain referenced navigation (TRN) methods with wheel odometry and inertial measurement unit (IMU) measurements using an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). Unlike simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) systems that require loop closures, the described approach maintains accuracy over long distances and one-way missions without the need to revisit previous positions. Evaluation of TRAELS is performed across a range of environments. In regions where a combination of distinctive geometric and ground surface features are present, the developed TRN methods are leveraged by TRAELS to consistently achieve an absolute trajectory error of less than 3.0 m. The approach is also shown to be capable of recovering from large accumulated drift when traversing feature-sparse areas, which is essential in ensuring robust performance of the system across a wide variety of challenging GNSS-denied environments. Overall, the effectiveness of the system in providing precise localization and mapping capabilities in challenging GNSS-denied environments is demonstrated and an analysis is performed leading to insights for improving TRN approaches for UGVs.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 9 figures, 2 tables, to be published in The Proceedings of the Institute of Navigation GNSS+ 2023 conference (ION GNSS+ 23)</p></details> |
| **[A LiDAR-Inertial SLAM Tightly-Coupled with Dropout-Tolerant GNSS Fusion for Autonomous Mine Service Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11492v1)** | 2023-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-modal sensor integration has become a crucial prerequisite for the real-world navigation systems. Recent studies have reported successful deployment of such system in many fields. However, it is still challenging for navigation tasks in mine scenes due to satellite signal dropouts, degraded perception, and observation degeneracy. To solve this problem, we propose a LiDAR-inertial odometry method in this paper, utilizing both Kalman filter and graph optimization. The front-end consists of multiple parallel running LiDAR-inertial odometries, where the laser points, IMU, and wheel odometer information are tightly fused in an error-state Kalman filter. Instead of the commonly used feature points, we employ surface elements for registration. The back-end construct a pose graph and jointly optimize the pose estimation results from inertial, LiDAR odometry, and global navigation satellite system (GNSS). Since the vehicle has a long operation time inside the tunnel, the largely accumulated drift may be not fully by the GNSS measurements. We hereby leverage a loop closure based re-initialization process to achieve full alignment. In addition, the system robustness is improved through handling data loss, stream consistency, and estimation error. The experimental results show that our system has a good tolerance to the long-period degeneracy with the cooperation different LiDARs and surfel registration, achieving meter-level accuracy even for tens of minutes running during GNSS dropouts.</p></details> |  |

Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) methods inevitably accumulate drift on exploratory trajectories and primarily rely on place revisiting and loop closing to keep a bounded global localization error. Loop closure techniques are significantly challenging in agricultural fields, as the local visual appearance of different views is very similar and might change easily due to weather effects. A suitable alternative in practice is to employ global sensor positioning systems jointly with the rest of the robot sensors. In this paper we propose and implement the fusion of global navigation satellite system (GNSS), stereo views, and inertial measurements for localization purposes. Specifically, we incorporate, in a tightly coupled manner, GNSS measurements into the stereo-inertial ORB-SLAM3 pipeline. We thoroughly evaluate our implementation in the sequences of the Rosario data set, recorded by an autonomous robot in soybean fields, and our own in-house data. Our data includes measurements from a conventional GNSS, rarely included in evaluations of state-of-the-art approaches. We characterize the performance of GNSS-stereo-inertial SLAM in this application case, reporting pose error reductions between 10% and 30% compared to visual-inertial and loosely coupled GNSS-stereo-inertial baselines. In addition to such analysis, we also release the code of our implementation as open source.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication in Journal of Field Robotics, 2023</p></details> |

The filter utilizes inertial measurement unit (IMU), ultra-wideband (UWB), and odometry velocity measurements to improve the localization performance of the system in the presence of a GNSS-denied environment. The contribution of this work is to evaluate the benefits of using ZU in a DEKF-based localization algorithm. The algorithm is tested with real hardware in a video motion capture facility and a Robot Operating System (ROS) based simulation environment for unmanned ground vehicles (UGV). Both simulation and real-world experiments are performed to show the effectiveness of using ZU in one robot to reinstate the localization of other robots in a multi-robot system. Experimental results from GNSS-denied simulation and real-world environments show that using ZU with simple heuristics in the DEKF significantly improves the 3D localization accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, preprint version, the manuscript is accepted for publication in NAVIGATION, the Journal of the Institute of Navigation.

| **[RNN-Based GNSS Positioning using Satellite Measurement Features and Pseudorange Residuals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05319v1)** | 2023-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) context, the growing number of available satellites has lead to many challenges when it comes to choosing the most accurate pseudorange contributions, given the strong impact of biased measurements on positioning accuracy, particularly in single-epoch scenarios. This work leverages the potential of machine learning in predicting link-wise measurement quality factors and, hence, optimize measurement weighting. For this purpose, we use a customized matrix composed of heterogeneous features such as conditional pseudorange residuals and per-link satellite metrics (e.g., carrier-to-noise power density ratio and its empirical statistics, satellite elevation, carrier phase lock time). This matrix is then fed as an input to a recurrent neural network (RNN) (i.e., a long-short term memory (LSTM) network). Our experimental results on real data, obtained from extensive field measurements, demonstrate the high potential of our proposed solution being able to outperform traditional measurements weighting and selection strategies from state-of-the-art.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Smoothing Using GNSS/PDR Integration Via Factor Graph Optimization in Urban Canyons](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14264v2)** | 2023-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and smooth global navigation satellite system (GNSS) positioning for pedestrians in urban canyons is still a challenge due to the multipath effects and the non-light-of-sight (NLOS) receptions caused by the reflections from surrounding buildings. The recently developed factor graph optimization (FGO) based GNSS positioning method opened a new window for improving urban GNSS positioning by effectively exploiting the measurement redundancy from the historical information to resist the outlier measurements. Unfortunately, the FGO-based GNSS standalone positioning is still challenged in highly urbanized areas. As an extension of the previous FGO-based GNSS positioning method, this paper exploits the potential of the pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) model in FGO to improve the GNSS standalone positioning performance in urban canyons. Specifically, the relative motion of the pedestrian is estimated based on the raw acceleration measurements from the onboard smartphone inertial measurement unit (IMU) via the PDR algorithm. Then the raw GNSS pseudorange, Doppler measurements, and relative motion from PDR are integrated using the FGO. Given the context of pedestrian navigation with a small acceleration most of the time, a novel soft motion model is proposed to smooth the states involved in the factor graph model. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified step-by-step through two datasets collected in dense urban canyons of Hong Kong using smartphone-level GNSS receivers. The comparison between the conventional extended Kalman filter, several existing methods, and FGO-based integration is presented. The results reveal that the existing FGO-based GNSS standalone positioning is highly complementary to the PDR's relative motion estimation. Both improved positioning accuracy and trajectory smoothness are obtained with the help of the proposed method.</p></details> | 11 pages, 14 figures |

However, civilian GNSS signals are usually not cryptographically protected. This makes attacks that forge signals relatively easy. Considering modern devices often have network connections and onboard sensors, the proposed here Probabilistic Detection of GNSS Spoofing (PDS) scheme is based on such opportunistic information. PDS has at its core two parts. First, a regression problem with motion model constraints, which equalizes the noise of all locations considering the motion model of the device. Second, a Gaussian process, that analyzes statistical properties of location data to construct uncertainty. Then, a likelihood function, that fuses the two parts, as a basis for a Neyman-Pearson lemma (NPL)-based detection strategy. Our experimental evaluation shows a performance gain over the state-of-the-art, in terms of attack detection effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

GNSS receivers, as part of the encompassing platform, can leverage external information to detect GNSS attacks. Specifically, cross-checking the time produced by the GNSS receiver against multiple trusted time sources can provide robust and assured PNT. In this work, we explore the combination of secure remote, network-based time providers and local precision oscillators. This multi-layered defense mechanism detects GNSS attacks that induce even small time offsets, including attacks mounted in cold start. Our system does not require any modification to the current structure of the GNSS receiver, it is agnostic to the satellite constellation and the attacker type. This makes time-based data validation of GNSS information compatible with existing receivers and readily deployable.</p></details> | <details><summary>In pr...</summary><p>In proceedings of the 2023 IEEE/ION Position Navigation and Localization Symposium (PLANS)</p></details> |

The state estimation and its protection-level generation often suffer from satellite-signal disturbances in urban environments and subsequent poor parametrization of the satellite observables. Thus, we propose an innovative scheme involving an extended H_infinity filter (EHF) for robust state estimation and zonotope for the protection-level generation. This scheme is shown as part of a tightly coupled navigation system based on an inertial navigation system and aided by the GPS/Galileo dual-constellation satellite navigation system. Specifically, GNSS pseudorange and deltarange observables are utilized. The experimental results of post-processing a real-world dataset show significant advantages of EHF against a conventional extended Kalman filter regarding the navigation accuracy and robustness under various GNSS-measurement parametrizations and environmental circumstances. The zonotope-based protection-level calculation is proven valid, computationally affordable, and feasible for real-time implementations.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work is published in Springer Nature GPS Solutions: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10291-023-01447-z</p></details> |

Nonetheless, in dense urban environments, GNSS-based SLAM systems will suffer from the Non-Line-Of-Sight (NLOS) measurements, which might lead to a sharp deterioration in localization results. In this paper, we propose to detect the sky area from the up-looking camera to improve GNSS measurement reliability for more accurate position estimation. We present Sky-GVINS: a sky-aware GNSS-Visual-Inertial system based on a recent work called GVINS. Specifically, we adopt a global threshold method to segment the sky regions and non-sky regions in the fish-eye sky-pointing image and then project satellites to the image using the geometric relationship between satellites and the camera. After that, we reject satellites in non-sky regions to eliminate NLOS signals. We investigated various segmentation algorithms for sky detection and found that the Otsu algorithm reported the highest classification rate and computational efficiency, despite the algorithm's simplicity and ease of implementation. To evaluate the effectiveness of Sky-GVINS, we built a ground robot and conducted extensive real-world experiments on campus. Experimental results show that our method improves localization accuracy in both open areas and dense urban environments compared to the baseline method. Finally, we also conduct a detailed analysis and point out possible further directions for future research.

| **[On the Limits of Cross-Authentication Checks for GNSS Signals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02977v1)** | 2023-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs) are implementing security mechanisms: examples are Galileo open service navigation message authentication (OS-NMA) and GPS chips-message robust authentication (CHIMERA). Each of these mechanisms operates in a single band. However, nowadays, even commercial GNSS receivers typically compute the position, velocity, and time (PVT) solution using multiple constellations and signals from multiple bands at once, significantly improving both accuracy and availability. Hence, cross-authentication checks have been proposed, based on the PVT obtained from the mixture of authenticated and non-authenticated signals. In this paper, first, we formalize the models for the cross-authentication checks. Next, we describe, for each check, a spoofing attack to generate a fake signal leading the victim to a target PVT without notice. We analytically relate the degrees of the freedom of the attacker in manipulating the victim's solution to both the employed security checks and the number of open signals that can be tampered with by the attacker. We test the performance of the considered attack strategies on an experimental dataset. Lastly, we show the limits of the PVT-based GNSS cross-authentication checks, where both authenticated and non-authenticated signals are used.</p></details> | Submitted to TIFS |

Tracking individuals in small areas such as schoolyards or nursing homes might impose difficulties for RTLS in terms of positioning accuracy. However, to date, few studies have investigated the performance of different localisation systems regarding the classification of human movement patterns in small areas. The current study aims to design and evaluate an automated framework to classify human movement trajectories obtained from two different RTLS: Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and Ultra-wideband (UWB), in areas of approximately 100 square meters. Specifically, we designed a versatile framework which takes GNSS or UWB data as input, extracts features from these data and classifies them according to the annotated spatial patterns. The automated framework contains three choices for applying noise removal: (i) no noise removal, (ii) Savitzky Golay filter on the raw location data or (iii) Savitzky Golay filter on the extracted features, as well as three choices regarding the classification algorithm: Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF) or Support Vector Machine (SVM). We integrated different stages within the framework with the Sequential Model-Based Algorithm Configuration (SMAC) to perform automated hyperparameter optimisation. The best performance is achieved with a pipeline consisting of noise removal applied to the raw location data with an RF model for the GNSS and no noise removal with an SVM model for the UWB. We further demonstrate through statistical analysis that the UWB achieves significantly higher results than the GNSS in classifying movement patterns.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted at BNAIC/BeNeLearn 2022 as an A type paper: https://bnaic2022.uantwerpen.be/wp-content/uploads/BNAICBeNeLearn_2022_submission_4040.pdf.

In addition to accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers, the proposed navigation filter relies on the accurate incremental displacement outputs generated by a VO (Visual Odometry) system, denoted here as a Virtual Vision Sensor or VVS, which relies on images of the Earth surface taken by an onboard camera and is itself assisted by the filter inertial estimations. Although not a full replacement for a GNSS receiver since its position observations are relative instead of absolute, the proposed system enables major reductions in the GNSS-Denied attitude and position estimation errors. In order to minimize the accumulation of errors in the absence of absolute observations, the filter is implemented in the manifold of rigid body rotations or SO (3). Stochastic high fidelity simulations of two representative scenarios involving the loss of GNSS signals are employed to evaluate the results.

Conventional fusion methods use low-accuracy pseudorange based GNSS measurements ($>>5m$ errors) and can only yield a coarse registration to the global earth-centered-earth-fixed (ECEF) frame. In this paper, we leverage high-precision GNSS carrier-phase positioning and aid it with local visual-inertial odometry (VIO) tracking using an extended Kalman filter (EKF) framework that better resolves the integer ambiguity concerned with GNSS carrier-phase. %to achieve centimeter-level accuracy in the ECEF frame. We also propose an algorithm for accurate GNSS-antenna-to-IMU extrinsics calibration to accurately align VIO to the ECEF frame. Together, our system achieves robust global positioning demonstrated by real-world hardware experiments in severely occluded urban canyons, and outperforms the state-of-the-art RTKLIB by a significant margin in terms of integer ambiguity solution fix rate and positioning RMSE accuracy.</p></details> |  |

To this end, global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) can provide absolute measurements outdoors and, therefore, eliminate long-term drift. However, fusing GNSS data with other sensor data is not trivial, especially when a robot moves between areas with and without sky view. We propose a robust approach that tightly fuses raw GNSS receiver data with inertial measurements and, optionally, lidar observations for precise and smooth mobile robot localization. A factor graph with two types of GNSS factors is proposed. First, factors based on pseudoranges, which allow for global localization on Earth. Second, factors based on carrier phases, which enable highly accurate relative localization, which is useful when other sensing modalities are challenged. Unlike traditional differential GNSS, this approach does not require a connection to a base station. On a public urban driving dataset, our approach achieves accuracy comparable to a state-of-the-art algorithm that fuses visual inertial odometry with GNSS data -- despite our approach not using the camera, just inertial and GNSS data. We also demonstrate the robustness of our approach using data from a car and a quadruped robot moving in environments with little sky visibility, such as a forest. The accuracy in the global Earth frame is still 1-2 m, while the estimated trajectories are discontinuity-free and smooth. We also show how lidar measurements can be tightly integrated. We believe this is the first system that fuses raw GNSS observations (as opposed to fixes) with lidar in a factor graph.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, accompanying video: https://youtu.be/55BLjt6ce1Y, accepted to the 2023 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)</p></details> |

This paper proposes a novel three-stage extrinsic calibration method between LiDAR and GNSS/INS for autonomous driving. The first stage can quickly calibrate the extrinsic parameters between the sensors through point cloud surface features so that the extrinsic can be narrowed from a large initial error to a small error range in little time. The second stage can further calibrate the extrinsic parameters based on LiDAR-mapping space occupancy while removing motion distortion. In the final stage, the z-axis errors caused by the plane motion of the autonomous vehicle are corrected, and an accurate extrinsic parameter is finally obtained. Specifically, This method utilizes the planar features in the environment, making it possible to quickly carry out calibration.

Unlike pose-graph-based methods that rely solely on pairwise relationships between LiDAR frames, LBA leverages raw LiDAR correspondences to achieve more precise results, especially when initial pose estimates are unreliable for low-cost sensors. However, existing LBA methods face challenges such as simplistic planar correspondences, extensive observations, and dense normal matrices in the least-squares problem, which limit robustness, efficiency, and scalability. To address these issues, we propose a Graph Optimality-aware Stochastic Optimization scheme with Progressive Spatial Smoothing, namely PSS-GOSO, to achieve \textit{robust}, \textit{efficient}, and \textit{scalable} LBA. The Progressive Spatial Smoothing (PSS) module extracts \textit{robust} LiDAR feature association exploiting the prior structure information obtained by the polynomial smooth kernel. The Graph Optimality-aware Stochastic Optimization (GOSO) module first sparsifies the graph according to optimality for an \textit{efficient} optimization. GOSO then utilizes stochastic clustering and graph marginalization to solve the large-scale state estimation problem for a \textit{scalable} LBA. We validate PSS-GOSO across diverse scenes captured by various platforms, demonstrating its superior performance compared to existing methods. Moreover, the resulting point cloud maps are used for automatic last-mile delivery in large-scale complex scenes. The project page can be found at: \url{https://kafeiyin00.github.io/PSS-GOSO/}.</p></details> |  |

For wheeled robots, a wheel kinematic model (i.e., wheel odometry) can improve the reliability of the odometry estimation. However, the kinematic model suffers from complex motions (e.g., wheel slippage, lateral movement) in the case of skid-steering robots particularly because this robot model rotates by skidding its wheels. Furthermore, these errors change nonlinearly when the wheel slippage is large (e.g., drifting) and are subject to terrain-dependent parameters. To simultaneously tackle point cloud degeneration and the kinematic model errors, we developed a LiDAR-IMU-wheel odometry algorithm incorporating online training of a neural network that learns the kinematic model of wheeled robots with nonlinearity. We propose to train the neural network online on a factor graph along with robot states, allowing the learning-based kinematic model to adapt to the current terrain condition. The proposed method jointly solves online training of the neural network and LiDARIMUwheel odometry on a unified factor graph to retain the consistency of all those constraints. Through experiments, we first verified that the proposed network adapted to a changing environment, resulting in an accurate odometry estimation across different environments. We then confirmed that the proposed odometry estimation algorithm was robust against point cloud degeneration and nonlinearity (e.g., large wheel slippage by drifting) of the kinematic model.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://youtu.be/CvRVhdda7Cw</p></details> |

Significant progress has been made in data-driven VO methods, particularly those leveraging deep learning techniques to extract image features and estimate camera poses. However, these methods often struggle in low-light conditions because of the reduced visibility of features and the increased difficulty of matching keypoints. To address this limitation, we introduce BrightVO, a novel VO model based on Transformer architecture, which not only performs front-end visual feature extraction, but also incorporates a multi-modality refinement module in the back-end that integrates Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data. Using pose graph optimization, this module iteratively refines pose estimates to reduce errors and improve both accuracy and robustness. Furthermore, we create a synthetic low-light dataset, KiC4R, which includes a variety of lighting conditions to facilitate the training and evaluation of VO frameworks in challenging environments. Experimental results demonstrate that BrightVO achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the KiC4R dataset and the KITTI benchmarks. Specifically, it provides an average improvement of 20% in pose estimation accuracy in normal outdoor environments and 259% in low-light conditions, outperforming existing methods.

Especially, we argue that latent codes stored in many NeRF SLAM systems are not fully exploited, as they are only used for better reconstruction. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective way to detect potential loops using the same latent codes as local features. To further improve the loop detection performance, we use the semantic information, which are also decoded from the same latent codes to guide the aggregation of local features. Finally, with the potential loops detected, we close them with a graph optimization followed by bundle adjustment to refine both the estimated poses and the reconstructed scene. To evaluate the performance of our SLC$^2$-SLAM, we conduct extensive experiments on Replica and ScanNet datasets. Our proposed semantic-guided loop closure significantly outperforms the pre-trained NetVLAD and ORB combined with Bag-of-Words, which are used in all the other NeRF SLAM with loop closure. As a result, our SLC$^2$-SLAM also demonstrated better tracking and reconstruction performance, especially in larger scenes with more loops, like ScanNet.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

To address these issues, the Switchable Temporal Plan Graph provides a framework for finding an acyclic Temporal Plan Graph with the minimum execution cost under delays, ensuring deadlock- and collision-free execution. Unfortunately, existing optimal algorithms, such as Mixed Integer Linear Programming and Graph-Based Switchable Edge Search (GSES), are often too slow for practical use. This paper introduces Improved GSES, which significantly accelerates GSES through four speedup techniques: stronger admissible heuristics, edge grouping, prioritized branching, and incremental implementation. Experiments conducted on four different map types with varying numbers of agents demonstrate that Improved GSES consistently achieves over twice the success rate of GSES and delivers up to a 30-fold speedup on instances where both methods successfully find solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025.

Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) focuses on moving multiple agents from their starts to goals without collisions. Its lifelong variant, LMAPF, continuously assigns new goals to agents. In this work, we focus on improving the solution quality of PIBT, a state-of-the-art rule-based LMAPF algorithm, by optimizing a policy to generate adaptive guidance. We design two pipelines to incorporate guidance in PIBT in two different ways. We demonstrate the superiority of the optimized policy over both static guidance and human-designed policies. Additionally, we explore scenarios where task distribution changes over time, a challenging yet common situation in real-world applications that is rarely explored in the literature.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages for the main text, 2 pages for reference and acknowledgement, 5 pages for appendix. 11 figures in total</p></details> |

In particular, it is crucial to plan a path to avoid risky terrain and reach the goal quickly and safely. In this paper, we propose a method for safe and distance-efficient path planning, leveraging Traversal Risk Graph (TRG), a novel graph representation that takes into account geometric traversability of the terrain. TRG nodes represent stability and reachability of the terrain, while edges represent relative traversal risk-weighted path candidates. Additionally, TRG is constructed in a wavefront propagation manner and managed hierarchically, enabling real-time planning even in large-scale environments. Lastly, we formulate a graph optimization problem on TRG that leads the robot to navigate by prioritizing both safe and short paths. Our approach demonstrated superior safety, distance efficiency, and fast processing time compared to the conventional methods. It was also validated in several real-world experiments using a quadrupedal robot. Notably, TRG-planner contributed as the global path planner of an autonomous navigation framework for the DreamSTEP team, which won the Quadruped Robot Challenge at ICRA 2023.

Keyframe sampling mitigates this by reducing the number of frames stored and processed in the back-end system. In this article, we address the gap in optimized keyframe sampling for the combined problem of pose graph optimization and loop closure detection. Our Minimal Subset Approach (MSA) employs an optimization strategy with two key factors, redundancy minimization and information preservation, within a sliding window framework to efficiently reduce redundant keyframes, while preserving essential information. This method delivers comparable performance to baseline approaches, while enhancing scalability and reducing computational overhead. Finally, we evaluate MSA on relevant publicly available datasets, showcasing that it consistently performs across a wide range of environments, without requiring any manual parameter tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 8 Figures, 2 Tables.

| **[Tightly Joined Positioning and Control Model for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Based on Factor Graph Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14724v2)** | 2024-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The execution of flight missions by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) primarily relies on navigation. In particular, the navigation pipeline has traditionally been divided into positioning and control, operating in a sequential loop. However, the existing navigation pipeline, where the positioning and control are decoupled, struggles to adapt to ubiquitous uncertainties arising from measurement noise, abrupt disturbances, and nonlinear dynamics. As a result, the navigation reliability of the UAV is significantly challenged in complex dynamic areas. For example, the ubiquitous global navigation satellite system (GNSS) positioning can be degraded by the signal reflections from surrounding high-rising buildings in complex urban areas, leading to significantly increased positioning uncertainty. An additional challenge is introduced to the control algorithm due to the complex wind disturbances in urban canyons. Given the fact that the system positioning and control are highly correlated with each other, this research proposes a **tightly joined positioning and control model (JPCM) based on factor graph optimization (FGO)**. In particular, the proposed JPCM combines sensor measurements from positioning and control constraints into a unified probabilistic factor graph. Specifically, the positioning measurements are formulated as the factors in the factor graph. In addition, the model predictive control (MPC) is also formulated as the additional factors in the factor graph. By solving the factor graph contributed by both the positioning-related factors and the MPC-based factors, the complementariness of positioning and control can be deeply exploited. Finally, we validate the effectiveness and resilience of the proposed method using a simulated quadrotor system which shows significantly improved trajectory following performance.</p></details> |  |

Developers usually develop several smart contracts into one project, implementing complex logic functions and multiple transaction operations. However, the interaction among these contracts poses challenges for developers analyzing the state logic. Due to the complex state logic in DEX projects, many critical state derailment defects have emerged in recent years. In this paper, we conduct the first systematic study of state derailment defects in DEX. We define five categories of state derailment defects and provide detailed analyses of them. Furthermore, we propose a novel deep learning-based framework StateGuard for detecting state derailment defects in DEX smart contracts. It leverages a smart contract deconstructor to deconstruct the contract into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), from which five categories of dependency features are extracted. Next, it implements a graph optimizer to process the structured data. At last, the optimized data is analyzed by Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to identify potential state derailment defects. We evaluated StateGuard through a dataset of 46 DEX projects containing 5,671 smart contracts, and it achieved 94.25% F1-score. In addition, in a comparison experiment with state-of-the-art, StateGuard leads the F1-score by 6.29%. To further verify its practicality, we used StateGuar to audit real-world contracts and successfully authenticated multiple novel CVEs.</p></details> | 13 pages |
| **[Challenges of Generating Structurally Diverse Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18859v2)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For many graph-related problems, it can be essential to have a set of structurally diverse graphs. For instance, such graphs can be used for testing graph algorithms or their neural approximations. However, to the best of our knowledge, the problem of generating structurally diverse graphs has not been explored in the literature. In this paper, we fill this gap. First, we discuss how to define diversity for a set of graphs, why this task is non-trivial, and how one can choose a proper diversity measure. Then, for a given diversity measure, we propose and compare several algorithms optimizing it: we consider approaches based on standard random graph models, local graph optimization, genetic algorithms, and neural generative models. We show that it is possible to significantly improve diversity over basic random graph generators. Additionally, our analysis of generated graphs allows us to better understand the properties of graph distances: depending on which diversity measure is used for optimization, the obtained graphs may possess very different structural properties which gives a better understanding of the graph distance underlying the diversity measure.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards a Converged Relational-Graph Optimization Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13480v3)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent ISO SQL:2023 standard adopts SQL/PGQ (Property Graph Queries), facilitating graph-like querying within relational databases. This advancement, however, underscores a significant gap in how to effectively optimize SQL/PGQ queries within relational database systems. To address this gap, we extend the foundational SPJ (Select-Project-Join) queries to SPJM queries, which include an additional matching operator for representing graph pattern matching in SQL/PGQ. Although SPJM queries can be converted to SPJ queries and optimized using existing relational query optimizers, our analysis shows that such a graph-agnostic method fails to benefit from graph-specific optimization techniques found in the literature. To address this issue, we develop a converged relational-graph optimization framework called RelGo for optimizing SPJM queries, leveraging joint efforts from both relational and graph query optimizations. Using DuckDB as the underlying relational execution engine, our experiments show that RelGo can generate efficient execution plans for SPJM queries. On well-established benchmarks, these plans exhibit an average speedup of 21.90x compared to those produced by the graph-agnostic optimizer.</p></details> |  |

Existing monocular and binocular vision SLAM systems have narrow FoV and are fragile in textureless environments with degenerated accuracy and limited robustness. Thus multi-camera SLAM systems are gaining attention because they can provide redundancy for texture degeneration with wide FoV. However, current multi-camera SLAM systems face massive data processing pressure and elaborately designed camera configurations, leading to estimation failures for arbitrarily arranged multi-camera systems. To address these problems, we propose a generic visual odometry for arbitrarily arranged multi-cameras, which can achieve metric-scale state estimation with high flexibility in the cameras' arrangement. Specifically, we first design a learning-based feature extraction and tracking framework to shift the pressure of CPU processing of multiple video streams. Then we use the rigid constraints between cameras to estimate the metric scale poses for robust SLAM system initialization. Finally, we fuse the features of the multi-cameras in the SLAM back-end to achieve robust pose estimation and online scale optimization. Additionally, multi-camera features help improve the loop detection for pose graph optimization. Experiments on KITTI-360 and MultiCamData datasets validate the robustness of our method over arbitrarily placed cameras. Compared with other stereo and multi-camera visual SLAM systems, our method obtains higher pose estimation accuracy with better generalization ability. Our codes and online demos are available at \url{https://github.com/JunhaoWang615/MCVO}</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |
| **[LiDAR-based Registration against Georeferenced Models for Globally Consistent Allocentric Maps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02533v1)** | 2024-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are irreplaceable in search and rescue (SAR) missions to obtain a situational overview or provide closeups without endangering personnel. However, UAVs heavily rely on global navigation satellite system (GNSS) for localization which works well in open spaces, but the precision drastically degrades in the vicinity of buildings. These inaccuracies hinder aggregation of diverse data from multiple sources in a unified georeferenced frame for SAR operators. In contrast, CityGML models provide approximate building shapes with accurate georeferenced poses. Besides, LiDAR works best in the vicinity of 3D structures. Hence, we refine coarse GNSS measurements by registering LiDAR maps against CityGML and digital elevation map (DEM) models as a prior for allocentric mapping. An intuitive plausibility score selects the best hypothesis based on occupancy using a 2D height map. Afterwards, we integrate the registration results in a continuous-time spline-based pose graph optimizer with LiDAR odometry and further sensing modalities to obtain globally consistent, georeferenced trajectories and maps. We evaluate the viability of our approach on multiple flights captured at two distinct testing sites. Our method successfully reduced GNSS offset errors from up-to 16 m to below 0.5 m on multiple flights. Furthermore, we obtain globally consistent maps w.r.t. prior 3D geospatial models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at IEEE International Symposium on Safety, Security, and Rescue Robotics (SSRR), New York City, USA, November 2024</p></details> |
| **[LiDAR SLAMMOT based on Confidence-guided Data Association](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01041v1)** | 2024-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the field of autonomous driving or robotics, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and multi-object tracking (MOT) are two fundamental problems and are generally applied separately. Solutions to SLAM and MOT usually rely on certain assumptions, such as the static environment assumption for SLAM and the accurate ego-vehicle pose assumption for MOT. But in complex dynamic environments, it is difficult or even impossible to meet these assumptions. Therefore, the SLAMMOT, i.e., simultaneous localization, mapping, and moving object tracking, integrated system of SLAM and object tracking, has emerged for autonomous vehicles in dynamic environments. However, many conventional SLAMMOT solutions directly perform data association on the predictions and detections for object tracking, but ignore their quality. In practice, inaccurate predictions caused by continuous multi-frame missed detections in temporary occlusion scenarios, may degrade the performance of tracking, thereby affecting SLAMMOT. To address this challenge, this paper presents a LiDAR SLAMMOT based on confidence-guided data association (Conf SLAMMOT) method, which tightly couples the LiDAR SLAM and the confidence-guided data association based multi-object tracking into a graph optimization backend for estimating the state of the ego-vehicle and objects simultaneously. The confidence of prediction and detection are applied in the factor graph-based multi-object tracking for its data association, which not only avoids the performance degradation caused by incorrect initial assignments in some filter-based methods but also handles issues such as continuous missed detection in tracking while also improving the overall performance of SLAMMOT. Various comparative experiments demonstrate the superior advantages of Conf SLAMMOT, especially in scenes with some missed detections.</p></details> |  |
| **[Utilizing Graph Generation for Enhanced Domain Adaptive Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06535v3)** | 2024-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The problem of Domain Adaptive in the field of Object Detection involves the transfer of object detection models from labeled source domains to unannotated target domains. Recent advancements in this field aim to address domain discrepancies by aligning pixel-pairs across domains within a non-Euclidean graphical space, thereby minimizing semantic distribution variance. Despite their remarkable achievements, these methods often use coarse semantic representations to model graphs, mainly due to ignoring non-informative elements and failing to focus on precise semantic alignment. Additionally, the generation of coarse graphs inherently introduces abnormal nodes, posing challenges and potentially biasing domain adaptation outcomes. Consequently, we propose a framework, which utilizes the Graph Generation to enhance the quality of DAOD (\method{}). Specifically, we introduce a Node Refinement module that utilizes a memory bank to reconstruct noisy sampled nodes while applying contrastive regularization to noisy features. To enhance semantic alignment, we propose separating domain-specific styles from category invariance encoded within graph covariances, which allows us to selectively remove domain-specific styles while preserving category-invariant information, thus facilitating more accurate semantic alignment across different domains. Furthermore, we propose a Graph Optimization adaptor, leveraging variational inference to mitigate the impact of abnormal nodes. Extensive experimentation across three adaptation benchmarks validates that \method{} achieves state-of-the-art performance in the task of unsupervised domain adaptation.</p></details> |  |

Integrity monitoring (IM) capability is required when FGO-based integrated navigation system is used for safety-critical applications. However, traditional researches on IM of integrated navigation system are mostly based on Kalman filter. It is urgent to develop effective IM scheme for FGO-based GNSS/INS/Vision integration. In this contribution, the position error bounding formula to ensure the integrity of the GNSS/INS/Vision integration based on FGO is designed and validated for the first time. It can be calculated by the linearized equations from the residuals of GNSS pseudo-range, IMU pre-integration and visual measurements. The specific position error bounding is given in the case of GNSS, INS and visual measurement faults. Field experiments were conducted to evaluate and validate the performance of the proposed position error bounding. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed position error bounding for the GNSS/INS/Vision integration based on FGO can correctly fit the position error against different fault modes, and the availability of integrity in six fault modes is 100% after correct and timely fault exclusion.</p></details> |  |

Compared to existing public datasets that primarily offer raw images, Open-Structure provides direct access to point and line measurements, correspondences, structural associations, and co-visibility factor graphs, which can be fed to various stages of SLAM pipelines to mitigate the impact of data preprocessing modules in ablation experiments. The dataset comprises two distinct types of sequences from the perspective of scenarios. The first type maintains reasonable observation and occlusion relationships, as these critical elements are extracted from public image-based sequences using our dataset generator. In contrast, the second type consists of carefully designed simulation sequences that enhance dataset diversity by introducing a wide range of trajectories and observations. Furthermore, a baseline is proposed using our dataset to evaluate widely used modules, including camera pose tracking, parametrization, and factor graph optimization, within SLAM systems. By evaluating these state-of-the-art algorithms across different scenarios, we discern each module's strengths and weaknesses in the context of camera tracking and optimization processes. The Open-Structure dataset and baseline system are openly accessible on website: \url{https://open-structure.github.io}, encouraging further research and development in the field of SLAM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Gravity-aligned Rotation Averaging with Circular Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12763v1)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing a 3D scene from unordered images is pivotal in computer vision and robotics, with applications spanning crowd-sourced mapping and beyond. While global Structure-from-Motion (SfM) techniques are scalable and fast, they often compromise on accuracy. To address this, we introduce a principled approach that integrates gravity direction into the rotation averaging phase of global pipelines, enhancing camera orientation accuracy and reducing the degrees of freedom. This additional information is commonly available in recent consumer devices, such as smartphones, mixed-reality devices and drones, making the proposed method readily accessible. Rooted in circular regression, our algorithm has similar convergence guarantees as linear regression. It also supports scenarios where only a subset of cameras have known gravity. Additionally, we propose a mechanism to refine error-prone gravity. We achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on four large-scale datasets. Particularly, the proposed method improves upon the SfM baseline by 13 AUC@$1^\circ$ points, on average, while running eight times faster. It also outperforms the standard planar pose graph optimization technique by 23 AUC@$1^\circ$ points. The code is at https://github.com/colmap/glomap.</p></details> | accepted at ECCV2024 |

However, their use in data science scenarios requiring solving long-term interconnected tasks, dynamic data adjustments and domain expertise remains challenging. Previous approaches primarily focus on individual tasks, making it difficult to assess the complete data science workflow. Moreover, they struggle to handle real-time changes in intermediate data and fail to adapt dynamically to evolving task dependencies inherent to data science problems. In this paper, we present Data Interpreter, an LLM-based agent designed to automatically solve various data science problems end-to-end. Our Data Interpreter incorporates two key modules: 1) Hierarchical Graph Modeling, which breaks down complex problems into manageable subproblems, enabling dynamic node generation and graph optimization; and 2) Programmable Node Generation, a technique that refines and verifies each subproblem to iteratively improve code generation results and robustness. Extensive experiments consistently demonstrate the superiority of Data Interpreter. On InfiAgent-DABench, it achieves a 25% performance boost, raising accuracy from 75.9% to 94.9%. For machine learning and open-ended tasks, it improves performance from 88% to 95%, and from 60% to 97%, respectively. Moreover, on the MATH dataset, Data Interpreter achieves remarkable performance with a 26% improvement compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

| **[Interdependency Matters: Graph Alignment for Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08877v1)** | 2024-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection in multivariate time series (MTS) is crucial for various applications in data mining and industry. Current industrial methods typically approach anomaly detection as an unsupervised learning task, aiming to identify deviations by estimating the normal distribution in noisy, label-free datasets. These methods increasingly incorporate interdependencies between channels through graph structures to enhance accuracy. However, the role of interdependencies is more critical than previously understood, as shifts in interdependencies between MTS channels from normal to anomalous data are significant. This observation suggests that \textit{anomalies could be detected by changes in these interdependency graph series}. To capitalize on this insight, we introduce MADGA (MTS Anomaly Detection via Graph Alignment), which redefines anomaly detection as a graph alignment (GA) problem that explicitly utilizes interdependencies for anomaly detection. MADGA dynamically transforms subsequences into graphs to capture the evolving interdependencies, and Graph alignment is performed between these graphs, optimizing an alignment plan that minimizes cost, effectively minimizing the distance for normal data and maximizing it for anomalous data. Uniquely, our GA approach involves explicit alignment of both nodes and edges, employing Wasserstein distance for nodes and Gromov-Wasserstein distance for edges. To our knowledge, this is the first application of GA to MTS anomaly detection that explicitly leverages interdependency for this purpose. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of MADGA, demonstrating its capability to detect anomalies and differentiate interdependencies, consistently achieving state-of-the-art across various scenarios.</p></details> |  |

As near capacity-approaching codes, Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes possess several advantages over other families of codes, the most notable being its efficient decoding via Belief Propagation. While many LDPC code design methods exist, the development of efficient sparse codes that meet the constraints of modern short code lengths and accommodate new channel models remains a challenge. In this work, we propose for the first time a gradient-based data-driven approach for the design of sparse codes. We develop locally optimal codes with respect to Belief Propagation decoding via the learning of the Factor graph under channel noise simulations. This is performed via a novel complete graph tensor representation of the Belief Propagation algorithm, optimized over finite fields via backpropagation and coupled with an efficient line-search method. The proposed approach is shown to outperform the decoding performance of existing popular codes by orders of magnitude and demonstrates the power of data-driven approaches for code design.</p></details> |  |

We reinforce the initial spatial graph with sparse temporal connections using local matches between consecutive frames to predict temporally consistent clusters across a temporal neighborhood. By jointly optimizing the spatiotemporal relations and node features of the dynamic scene graph with the downstream task of phase segmentation, we address the costly and annotation-burdensome task of semantic scene comprehension and scene graph generation in surgical videos using only weak surgical phase labels.

| **[Robust Gaussian Splatting SLAM by Leveraging Loop Closure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20111v1)** | 2024-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting algorithms excel in novel view rendering applications and have been adapted to extend the capabilities of traditional SLAM systems. However, current Gaussian Splatting SLAM methods, designed mainly for hand-held RGB or RGB-D sensors, struggle with tracking drifts when used with rotating RGB-D camera setups. In this paper, we propose a robust Gaussian Splatting SLAM architecture that utilizes inputs from rotating multiple RGB-D cameras to achieve accurate localization and photorealistic rendering performance. The carefully designed Gaussian Splatting Loop Closure module effectively addresses the issue of accumulated tracking and mapping errors found in conventional Gaussian Splatting SLAM systems. First, each Gaussian is associated with an anchor frame and categorized as historical or novel based on its timestamp. By rendering different types of Gaussians at the same viewpoint, the proposed loop detection strategy considers both co-visibility relationships and distinct rendering outcomes. Furthermore, a loop closure optimization approach is proposed to remove camera pose drift and maintain the high quality of 3D Gaussian models. The approach uses a lightweight pose graph optimization algorithm to correct pose drift and updates Gaussians based on the optimized poses. Additionally, a bundle adjustment scheme further refines camera poses using photometric and geometric constraints, ultimately enhancing the global consistency of scenarios. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in camera pose estimation and novel view rendering tasks. The code will be open-sourced for the community.</p></details> |  |

Efficient, accurate self and mutual state estimation are the critical preconditions for completing these swarm tasks, which remain challenging research topics. This paper proposes Swarm-LIO2: a fully decentralized, plug-and-play, computationally efficient, and bandwidth-efficient LiDAR-inertial odometry for aerial swarm systems. Swarm-LIO2 uses a decentralized, plug-and-play network as the communication infrastructure. Only bandwidth-efficient and low-dimensional information is exchanged, including identity, ego-state, mutual observation measurements, and global extrinsic transformations. To support the plug-and-play of new teammate participants, Swarm-LIO2 detects potential teammate UAVs and initializes the temporal offset and global extrinsic transformation all automatically. To enhance the initialization efficiency, novel reflectivity-based UAV detection, trajectory matching, and factor graph optimization methods are proposed. For state estimation, Swarm-LIO2 fuses LiDAR, IMU, and mutual observation measurements within an efficient ESIKF framework, with careful compensation of temporal delay and modeling of measurements to enhance the accuracy and consistency.</p></details> | 23 Pages |

To this end, we introduce Walker, the first self-supervised tracker that learns from videos with sparse bounding box annotations, and no tracking labels. First, we design a quasi-dense temporal object appearance graph, and propose a novel multi-positive contrastive objective to optimize random walks on the graph and learn instance similarities. Then, we introduce an algorithm to enforce mutually-exclusive connective properties across instances in the graph, optimizing the learned topology for MOT. At inference time, we propose to associate detected instances to tracklets based on the max-likelihood transition state under motion-constrained bi-directional walks. Walker is the first self-supervised tracker to achieve competitive performance on MOT17, DanceTrack, and BDD100K. Remarkably, our proposal outperforms the previous self-supervised trackers even when drastically reducing the annotation requirements by up to 400x.</p></details> | ECCV 2024 |
| **[CF-GO-Net: A Universal Distribution Learner via Characteristic Function Networks with Graph Optimizers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12610v1)** | 2024-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models aim to learn the distribution of datasets, such as images, so as to be able to generate samples that statistically resemble real data. However, learning the underlying probability distribution can be very challenging and intractable. To this end, we introduce an approach which employs the characteristic function (CF), a probabilistic descriptor that directly corresponds to the distribution. However, unlike the probability density function (pdf), the characteristic function not only always exists, but also provides an additional degree of freedom, hence enhances flexibility in learning distributions. This removes the critical dependence on pdf-based assumptions, which limit the applicability of traditional methods. While several works have attempted to use CF in generative modeling, they often impose strong constraints on the training process. In contrast, our approach calculates the distance between query points in the CF domain, which is an unconstrained and well defined problem. Next, to deal with the sampling strategy, which is crucial to model performance, we propose a graph neural network (GNN)-based optimizer for the sampling process, which identifies regions where the difference between CFs is most significant. In addition, our method allows the use of a pre-trained model, such as a well-trained autoencoder, and is capable of learning directly in its feature space, without modifying its parameters. This offers a flexible and robust approach to generative modeling, not only provides broader applicability and improved performance, but also equips any latent space world with the ability to become a generative model.</p></details> |  |

Integrating diverse and complementary sensors such as global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and 4D-radar can provide scalable and reliable global localization. Nevertheless, multi-sensor fusion encounters challenges including heterogeneity and time-varying uncertainty in measurements. Consequently, developing a reliable and unified multi-sensor framework remains challenging. In this paper, we introduce UniMSF, a comprehensive multi-sensor fusion localization framework for ITS, utilizing factor graphs. By integrating a multi-sensor fusion front-end, alongside outlier detection\&noise model estimation, and a factor graph optimization back-end, this framework accomplishes efficient fusion and ensures accurate localization for ITS. Specifically, in the multi-sensor fusion front-end module, we tackle the measurement heterogeneity among different modality sensors and establish effective measurement models. Reliable outlier detection and data-driven online noise estimation methods ensure that back-end optimization is immune to interference from outlier measurements. In addition, integrating multi-sensor observations via factor graph optimization offers the advantage of \enquote{plug and play}. Notably, our framework features high modularity and is seamlessly adapted to various sensor configurations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework through real vehicle tests by tightly integrating GNSS pseudorange and carrier phase information with IMU, and 4D-radar.</p></details> |  |

Compared to traditional geometric methods prioritizing texture-affluent features like edges, our keypoint selector employs the learned uncertainty to filter out the low-quality features based on global inconsistency. In contrast to the learning-based algorithms that model the scale-agnostic diagonal weight matrix for covariance, we design a metrics-aware covariance model to capture the spatial error during keypoint registration and the correlations between different axes. Integrating this covariance model into pose graph optimization enhances the robustness and reliability of pose estimation, particularly in challenging environments with varying illumination, feature density, and motion patterns. On public benchmark datasets, MAC-VO outperforms existing VO algorithms and even some SLAM algorithms in challenging environments. The covariance map also provides valuable information about the reliability of the estimated poses, which can benefit decision-making for autonomous systems.</p></details> |  |

However, dense point clouds face challenges of high memory consumption and reduced maintainability for long-term operations. In this study, we introduce SLIM, a scalable and lightweight mapping system for long-term LiDAR mapping in urban environments. The system begins by parameterizing structural point clouds into lines and planes. These lightweight and structural representations meet the requirements of map merging, pose graph optimization, and bundle adjustment, ensuring incremental management and local consistency. For long-term operations, a map-centric nonlinear factor recovery method is designed to sparsify poses while preserving mapping accuracy. We validate the SLIM system with multi-session real-world LiDAR data from classical LiDAR mapping datasets, including KITTI, NCLT, and HeLiPR. The experiments demonstrate its capabilities in mapping accuracy, lightweightness, and scalability. Map re-use is also verified through map-based robot localization. Ultimately, with multi-session LiDAR data, the SLIM system provides a globally consistent map with low memory consumption (130 KB/km). We have made our code open-source to benefit the community.</p></details> | 20 pages, 16 figures |

However, the pose-only solution has not yet been properly considered in a tightly-coupled visual-inertial state estimator (VISE) with a normal configuration for real-time navigation. In this study, we propose a tightly-coupled LiDAR-enhanced VISE, named PO-VINS, with a full pose-only form for visual and LiDAR-depth measurements. Based on the pose-only visual representation, we derive the analytical depth uncertainty, which is then employed for rejecting LiDAR depth outliers. Besides, we propose a multi-state constraint (MSC)-based LiDAR-depth measurement model with a pose-only form, to balance efficiency and robustness. The pose-only visual and LiDAR-depth measurements and the IMU-preintegration measurements are tightly integrated under the factor graph optimization framework to perform efficient and accurate state estimation. Exhaustive experimental results on private and public datasets indicate that the proposed PO-VINS yields improved or comparable accuracy to sate-of-the-art methods. Compared to the baseline method LE-VINS, the state-estimation efficiency of PO-VINS is improved by 33% and 56% on the laptop PC and the onboard ARM computer, respectively. Besides, PO-VINS yields higher accuracy and robustness than LE-VINS by employing the proposed uncertainty-based outlier-culling method and the MSC-based measurement model for LiDAR depth.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 13 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

However, the ethnic disparity in these models' predictions needs to be addressed before deploying them. We introduce a novel approach, PatchAlign, to enhance skin condition image classification accuracy and fairness by aligning with clinical text representations of skin conditions. PatchAlign uses Graph Optimal Transport (GOT) Loss as a regularizer to perform cross-domain alignment. The representations obtained are robust and generalize well across skin tones, even with limited training samples. To reduce the effect of noise and artifacts in clinical dermatology images, we propose a learnable Masked Graph Optimal Transport for cross-domain alignment that further improves fairness metrics. We compare our model to the state-of-the-art FairDisCo on two skin lesion datasets with different skin types: Fitzpatrick17k and Diverse Dermatology Images (DDI). PatchAlign enhances the accuracy of skin condition image classification by 2.8% (in-domain) and 6.2% (out-domain) on Fitzpatrick17k, and 4.2% (in-domain) on DDI compared to FairDisCo. Additionally, it consistently improves the fairness of true positive rates across skin tones. The source code for the implementation is available at the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/aayushmanace/PatchAlign24, enabling easy reproduction and further experimentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>MICCA...</summary><p>MICCAI 2024.

| **[SurgTrack: CAD-Free 3D Tracking of Real-world Surgical Instruments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02598v1)** | 2024-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-based surgical navigation has received increasing attention due to its non-invasive, cost-effective, and flexible advantages. In particular, a critical element of the vision-based navigation system is tracking surgical instruments. Compared with 2D instrument tracking methods, 3D instrument tracking has broader value in clinical practice, but is also more challenging due to weak texture, occlusion, and lack of Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models for 3D registration. To solve these challenges, we propose the SurgTrack, a two-stage 3D instrument tracking method for CAD-free and robust real-world applications. In the first registration stage, we incorporate an Instrument Signed Distance Field (SDF) modeling the 3D representation of instruments, achieving CAD-freed 3D registration. Due to this, we can obtain the location and orientation of instruments in the 3D space by matching the video stream with the registered SDF model. In the second tracking stage, we devise a posture graph optimization module, leveraging the historical tracking results of the posture memory pool to optimize the tracking results and improve the occlusion robustness. Furthermore, we collect the Instrument3D dataset to comprehensively evaluate the 3D tracking of surgical instruments. The extensive experiments validate the superiority and scalability of our SurgTrack, by outperforming the state-of-the-arts with a remarkable improvement.

We unify these approaches by describing LLM-based agents as computational graphs. The nodes implement functions to process multimodal data or query LLMs, and the edges describe the information flow between operations. Graphs can be recursively combined into larger composite graphs representing hierarchies of inter-agent collaboration (where edges connect operations of different agents). Our novel automatic graph optimizers (1) refine node-level LLM prompts (node optimization) and (2) improve agent orchestration by changing graph connectivity (edge optimization). Experiments demonstrate that our framework can be used to efficiently develop, integrate, and automatically improve various LLM agents.

However, existing 3DGS-based methods fail to address the global consistency of the scene via loop closure and/or global bundle adjustment. To this end, we propose LoopSplat, which takes RGB-D images as input and performs dense mapping with 3DGS submaps and frame-to-model tracking. LoopSplat triggers loop closure online and computes relative loop edge constraints between submaps directly via 3DGS registration, leading to improvements in efficiency and accuracy over traditional global-to-local point cloud registration. It uses a robust pose graph optimization formulation and rigidly aligns the submaps to achieve global consistency. Evaluation on the synthetic Replica and real-world TUM-RGBD, ScanNet, and ScanNet++ datasets demonstrates competitive or superior tracking, mapping, and rendering compared to existing methods for dense RGB-D SLAM.

This paper proposes a Tracklet Graph and Query Graph-based framework, i.e., GSLAMOT, to address this challenge. GSLAMOT utilizes camera and LiDAR multimodal information as inputs and divides the representation of the dynamic scene into a semantic map for representing the static environment, a trajectory of the ego-agent, and an online maintained Tracklet Graph (TG) for tracking and predicting the 3D poses of the detected mobile objects. A Query Graph (QG) is constructed in each frame by object detection to query and update TG. For accurate object association, a Multi-criteria Star Graph Association (MSGA) method is proposed to find matched objects between the detections in QG and the predicted tracklets in TG. Then, an Object-centric Graph Optimization (OGO) method is proposed to simultaneously optimize the TG, the semantic map, and the agent trajectory. It triangulates the detected objects into the map to enrich the map's semantic information. We address the efficiency issues to handle the three tightly coupled tasks in parallel. Experiments are conducted on KITTI, Waymo, and an emulated Traffic Congestion dataset that highlights challenging scenarios. Experiments show that GSLAMOT enables accurate crowded object tracking while conducting SLAM accurately in challenging scenarios, demonstrating more excellent performances than the state-of-the-art methods.

The optimization procedure can be negatively affected even by a single outlier measurement, with possible catastrophic and meaningless results. Although recent works on robust optimization aim to mitigate the presence of outlier measurements, robust solutions capable of handling large numbers of outliers are yet to come. This paper presents IPC, acronym for Incremental Probabilistic Consensus, a method that approximates the solution to the combinatorial problem of finding the maximally consistent set of measurements in an incremental fashion. It evaluates the consistency of each loop closure measurement through a consensus-based procedure, possibly applied to a subset of the global problem, where all previously integrated inlier measurements have veto power. We evaluated IPC on standard benchmarks against several state-of-the-art methods. Although it is simple and relatively easy to implement, IPC competes with or outperforms the other tested methods in handling outliers while providing online performances. We release with this paper an open-source implementation of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication at the 2024 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)</p></details> |

In this paper, we represent the rotation and translation by a unit quaternion and a three-dimensional vector, and propose a new PGO model based on the von Mises-Fisher distribution. The constraints derived from the unit quaternions are spherical manifolds, and the projection onto the constraints can be calculated by normalization. Then a proximal linearized Riemannian alternating direction method of multipliers (PieADMM) is developed to solve the proposed model, which not only has low memory requirements, but also can update the poses in parallel. Furthermore, we establish the iteration complexity of $O(1/\epsilon^{2})$ of PieADMM for finding an $\epsilon$-stationary solution of our model. The efficiency of our proposed algorithm is demonstrated by numerical experiments on two synthetic and four 3D SLAM benchmark datasets.</p></details> |  |

The state-of-the-art approaches usually employ a tracking-by-detection method, and data association plays a critical role. This paper proposes a learning and graph-optimized (LEGO) modular tracker to improve data association performance in the existing literature. The proposed LEGO tracker integrates graph optimization and self-attention mechanisms, which efficiently formulate the association score map, facilitating the accurate and efficient matching of objects across time frames. To further enhance the state update process, the Kalman filter is added to ensure consistent tracking by incorporating temporal coherence in the object states.

However, it has not yet been properly considered and studied for LiDAR-based odometry. In this paper, we propose a novel tightly coupled LiDAR-inertial odometry based on the MSCKF framework, named MSC-LIO. An efficient LiDAR same-plane-point (LSPP) tracking method, without explicit feature extraction, is present for frame-to-frame data associations. The tracked LSPPs are employed to build an LSPP measurement model, which constructs a multi-state constraint. Besides, we propose an effective point-velocity-based LiDAR-IMU time-delay (LITD) estimation method, which is derived from the proposed LSPP tracking method. Extensive experiments were conducted on both public and private datasets. The results demonstrate that the proposed MSC-LIO yields higher accuracy and efficiency than the state-of-the-art methods. The ablation experiment results indicate that the data-association efficiency is improved by nearly 3 times using the LSPP tracking method.

However, existing approaches often struggle with data redundancy, robustness, and accuracy in complex environments. To address these challenges, we present MS-Mapping, an novel multi-session LiDAR mapping system that employs an incremental mapping scheme for robust and accurate map assembly in large-scale environments. Our approach introduces three key innovations: 1) A distribution-aware keyframe selection method that captures the subtle contributions of each point cloud frame to the map by analyzing the similarity of map distributions. This method effectively reduces data redundancy and pose graph size, while enhancing graph optimization speed; 2) An uncertainty model that automatically performs least-squares adjustments according to the covariance matrix during graph optimization, improving mapping precision, robustness, and flexibility without the need for scene-specific parameter tuning. This uncertainty model enables our system to monitor pose uncertainty and avoid ill-posed optimizations, thereby increasing adaptability to diverse and challenging environments. 3) To ensure fair evaluation, we redesign baseline comparisons and the evaluation benchmark. Direct assessment of map accuracy demonstrates the superiority of the proposed MS-Mapping algorithm compared to state-of-the-art methods. In addition to employing public datasets such as Urban-Nav, FusionPortable, and Newer College, we conducted extensive experiments on such a large \SI{855}{m}$\times$\SI{636}{m} ground truth map, collecting over \SI{20}{km} of indoor and outdoor data across more than ten sequences...</p></details> | 18 pages, 22 figures |

Sensors are often corrupted in those complicated and large-scale environments. This paper introduces GNSS-FGO, an online and global trajectory estimator that fuses GNSS observations alongside multiple sensor measurements for robust vehicle localization. In GNSS-FGO, we fuse asynchronous sensor measurements into the graph with a continuous-time trajectory representation using Gaussian process regression. This enables querying states at arbitrary timestamps so that sensor observations are fused without requiring strict state and measurement synchronization. Thus, the proposed method presents a generalized factor graph for multi-sensor fusion. To evaluate and study different GNSS fusion strategies, we fuse GNSS measurements in loose and tight coupling with a speed sensor, IMU, and lidar-odometry. We employed datasets from measurement campaigns in Aachen, Duesseldorf, and Cologne in experimental studies and presented comprehensive discussions on sensor observations, smoother types, and hyperparameter tuning. Our results show that the proposed approach enables robust trajectory estimation in dense urban areas, where the classic multi-sensor fusion method fails due to sensor degradation. In a test sequence containing a 17km route through Aachen, the proposed method results in a mean 2D positioning error of 0.48m while fusing raw GNSS observations with lidar odometry in a tight coupling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the IEEE Transactions on Robotics</p></details> |
| **[RoCo:Robust Collaborative Perception By Iterative Object Matching and Pose Adjustment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00257v1)** | 2024-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collaborative autonomous driving with multiple vehicles usually requires the data fusion from multiple modalities. To ensure effective fusion, the data from each individual modality shall maintain a reasonably high quality. However, in collaborative perception, the quality of object detection based on a modality is highly sensitive to the relative pose errors among the agents. It leads to feature misalignment and significantly reduces collaborative performance. To address this issue, we propose RoCo, a novel unsupervised framework to conduct iterative object matching and agent pose adjustment. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to model the pose correction problem in collaborative perception as an object matching task, which reliably associates common objects detected by different agents. On top of this, we propose a graph optimization process to adjust the agent poses by minimizing the alignment errors of the associated objects, and the object matching is re-done based on the adjusted agent poses. This process is carried out iteratively until convergence. Experimental study on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrates that the proposed framework RoCo consistently outperforms existing relevant methods in terms of the collaborative object detection performance, and exhibits highly desired robustness when the pose information of agents is with high-level noise. Ablation studies are also provided to show the impact of its key parameters and components. The code is released at https://github.com/HuangZhe885/RoCo.</p></details> | ACM MM2024 |

However, commonly available prior maps are still tailored to control-and-decision tasks, and the use of these maps for localization remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose a lidar-based localization and mapping (LOAM) system that can exploit the common HD-maps in autonomous driving scenarios. Specifically, we propose a technique to extract information from the drivable area and ground surface height components of the HD-maps to construct 4DOF pose priors. These pose priors are then further integrated into the pose-graph optimization problem to create a globally consistent 3D map. Experiments show that our scheme can significantly improve the global consistency of the map compared to state-of-the-art lidar-only approaches, proven to be a useful technology to enhance the system's robustness, especially in GPS-denied environment. Moreover, our work also serves as a first step towards long-term navigation of robots in familiar environment, by updating a map. In autonomous driving this could enable updating the HD-maps without sourcing a new from a third party company, which is expensive and introduces delays from change in the world to updated map.</p></details> |  |

To improve detection performance, counterfactual graphs have been exploited to benefit the generalization capacity by learning causal relations. Most existing studies directly introduce perturbations (e.g., flipping edges) to generate counterfactual graphs, which are prone to alter the semantics of generated examples and make them off the data manifold, resulting in sub-optimal performance. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach, Motif-consistent Counterfactuals with Adversarial Refinement (MotifCAR), for graph-level anomaly detection. The model combines the motif of one graph, the core subgraph containing the identification (category) information, and the contextual subgraph (non-motif) of another graph to produce a raw counterfactual graph. However, the produced raw graph might be distorted and cannot satisfy the important counterfactual properties: Realism, Validity, Proximity and Sparsity. Towards that, we present a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based graph optimizer to refine the raw counterfactual graphs. It adopts the discriminator to guide the generator to generate graphs close to realistic data, i.e., meet the property Realism. Further, we design the motif consistency to force the motif of the generated graphs to be consistent with the realistic graphs, meeting the property Validity. Also, we devise the contextual loss and connection loss to control the contextual subgraph and the newly added links to meet the properties Proximity and Sparsity. As a result, the model can generate high-quality counterfactual graphs. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of MotifCAR.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD 2024 |

Recently, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have emerged as a promising framework for 3D modeling. However, NeRFs require accurate camera poses as input, and existing methods struggle to handle significantly noisy pose estimates (i.e., outliers), which are commonly encountered in real-world scenarios. To tackle this challenge, we present a novel approach that optimizes radiance fields with scene graphs to mitigate the influence of outlier poses. Our method incorporates an adaptive inlier-outlier confidence estimation scheme based on scene graphs, emphasizing images of high compatibility with the neighborhood and consistency in the rendering quality. We also introduce an effective intersection-over-union (IoU) loss to optimize the camera pose and surface geometry, together with a coarse-to-fine strategy to facilitate the training. Furthermore, we propose a new dataset containing typical outlier poses for a detailed evaluation. Experimental results on various datasets consistently demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method over existing approaches, showcasing its robustness in handling outliers and producing high-quality 3D reconstructions.

| **[FE-GUT: Factor Graph Optimization hybrid with Extended Kalman Filter for tightly coupled GNSS/UWB Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06915v1)** | 2024-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Precise positioning and navigation information has been increasingly important with the development of the consumer electronics market. Due to some deficits of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), such as susceptible to interferences, integrating of GNSS with additional alternative sensors is a promising approach to overcome the performance limitations of GNSS-based localization systems. Ultra-Wideband (UWB) can be used to enhance GNSS in constructing an integrated localization system. However, most low-cost UWB devices lack a hardware-level time synchronization feature, which necessitates the estimation and compensation of the time-offset in the tightly coupled GNSS/UWB integration. Given the flexibility of probabilistic graphical models, the time-offset can be modeled as an invariant constant in the discretization of the continuous model. This work proposes a novel architecture in which Factor Graph Optimization (FGO) is hybrid with Extend Kalman Filter (EKF) for tightly coupled GNSS/UWB integration with online Temporal calibration (FE-GUT). FGO is utilized to precisely estimate the time-offset, while EKF provides initailization for the new factors and performs time-offset compensation. Simulation-based experiments validate the integrated localization performance of FE-GUT. In a four-wheeled robot scenario, the results demonstrate that, compared to EKF, FE-GUT can improve horizontal and vertical localization accuracy by 58.59\% and 34.80\%, respectively, while the time-offset estimation accuracy is improved by 76.80\%.

The proposed approach is based on a Voxel-TSDF representation used in recent algorithms. It introduces novel ways of integrating semantic prediction confidence during mapping, producing semantic and instance-consistent 3D regions. Further improvements are achieved by graph optimization-based semantic labeling and instance refinement. The proposed method achieves accuracy superior to the state of the art on public large-scale datasets, improving on a number of widely used metrics. We also highlight a downfall in the evaluation of recent studies: using the ground truth trajectory as input instead of a SLAM-estimated one substantially affects the accuracy, creating a large gap between the reported results and the actual performance on real-world data.</p></details> | 8 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Quadratic Optimal Control of Graphon Q-noise Linear Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00212v1)** | 2024-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The modelling of linear quadratic Gaussian optimal control problems on large complex networks is intractable computationally. Graphon theory provides an approach to overcome these issues by defining limit objects for infinite sequences of graphs permitting one to approximate arbitrarily large networks by infinite dimensional operators. This is extended to stochastic systems by the use of Q-noise, a generalization of Wiener processes in finite dimensional spaces to processes in function spaces. The optimal control of linear quadratic problems on graphon systems with Q-noise disturbances are defined and shown to be the limit of the corresponding finite graph optimal control problem. The theory is extended to low rank systems, and a fully worked special case is presented. In addition, the worst-case long-range average and infinite horizon discounted optimal control performance with respect to Q-noise distribution are computed for a small set of standard graphon limits.</p></details> | 18 pages, 6 figures |

Such robots require SLAM algorithms suitable for specific applications and environments. Hence, several SLAM frameworks have been proposed to address various requirements in the past decade. However, we have encountered challenges in implementing recent innovative frameworks when handling service robots with low-end processors and insufficient sensor data, such as low-resolution 2D LiDAR sensors. Specifically, regarding commercial robots, consistent performance in different hardware configurations and environments is more crucial than the performance dedicated to specific sensors or environments. Therefore, we propose a) a multi-stage %hierarchical approach for global pose estimation in embedded systems; b) a graph generation method with zero constraints for synchronized sensors; and c) a robust and memory-efficient method for long-term pose-graph optimization. As verified in in-home and large-scale indoor environments, the proposed method yields consistent global pose estimation for services in commercial fields. Furthermore, the proposed method exhibits potential commercial viability considering the consistent performance verified via mass production and long-term (> 5 years) operation.</p></details> |  |

While open resources like OpenStreetMap (OSM) offer road networks with well-defined topology, they may not always be up to date worldwide. In this paper, we propose a fully automated pipeline for extracting road networks from very-high-resolution (VHR) satellite imagery. Our approach directly generates road line-strings that are seamlessly connected and precisely positioned. The process involves three key modules: a CNN-based neural network for road segmentation, a graph optimization algorithm to convert road predictions into vector line-strings, and a machine learning model for classifying road materials. Compared to OSM data, our results demonstrate significant potential for providing the latest road layouts and precise positions of road segments.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Unified Framework for Integer Programming Formulation of Graph Matching Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07666v1)** | 2024-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph theory has been a powerful tool in solving difficult and complex problems arising in all disciplines. In particular, graph matching is a classical problem in pattern analysis with enormous applications. Many graph problems have been formulated as a mathematical program and then solved using exact, heuristic, and/or approximated-guaranteed procedures. On the other hand, graph theory has been a powerful tool in visualizing and understanding complex mathematical programming problems, especially integer programs. Formulating a graph problem as a natural integer program (IP) is often a challenging task. However, an IP formulation of the problem has many advantages. Several researchers have noted the need for natural IP formulation of graph theoretic problems. The present study aims to provide a unified framework for IP formulation of graph-matching problems. Although there are many surveys on graph matching problems, none is concerned with IP formulation. This paper is the first to provide a comprehensive IP formulation for such problems. The framework includes a variety of graph optimization problems in the literature. While these problems have been studied by different research communities, however, the framework presented here helps to bring efforts from different disciplines to tackle such diverse and complex problems. We hope the present study can significantly help to simplify some of the difficult problems arising in practice, especially in pattern analysis.</p></details> | 34 pages |

We introduce various types of errors commonly encountered in SLAM, including reprojection error, photometric error, relative pose error, and line reprojection error, alongside their mathematical formulations. The fundamental role of error as the discrepancy between observed and predicted values in SLAM optimization is examined, emphasizing non-linear least squares methods for optimization. We provide a detailed analysis of: - Reprojection Error: Including Jacobian calculations for camera poses and map points, highlighting both theoretical underpinnings and practical consequences. - Photometric Error: Addressing errors from image intensity variations, essential for direct method-based SLAM. - Relative Pose Error: Discussing its significance in pose graph optimization, especially in loop closure scenarios. The paper also presents extensive derivations of Jacobian matrices for various SLAM components such as camera poses, map points, and motion parameters. We explore the application of Lie theory to optimize rotation representations and transformations, improving computational efficiency. Specific software implementations are referenced, offering practical insights into the real-world application of these theories in SLAM systems. Additionally, advanced topics such as line reprojection errors and IMU measurement errors are explored, discussing their impact on SLAM accuracy and performance. This comprehensive examination aims to enhance understanding and implementation of error analysis and Jacobian derivation in SLAM, contributing to more accurate and efficient state estimation in complex environments.</p></details> |  |

In response, we introduce Loopy-SLAM that globally optimizes poses and the dense 3D model. We use frame-to-model tracking using a data-driven point-based submap generation method and trigger loop closures online by performing global place recognition. Robust pose graph optimization is used to rigidly align the local submaps. As our representation is point based, map corrections can be performed efficiently without the need to store the entire history of input frames used for mapping as typically required by methods employing a grid based mapping structure. Evaluation on the synthetic Replica and real-world TUM-RGBD and ScanNet datasets demonstrate competitive or superior performance in tracking, mapping, and rendering accuracy when compared to existing dense neural RGBD SLAM methods.

| **[Fusing Structure from Motion and Simulation-Augmented Pose Regression from Optical Flow for Challenging Indoor Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07250v4)** | 2024-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The localization of objects is a crucial task in various applications such as robotics, virtual and augmented reality, and the transportation of goods in warehouses. Recent advances in deep learning have enabled the localization using monocular visual cameras. While structure from motion (SfM) predicts the absolute pose from a point cloud, absolute pose regression (APR) methods learn a semantic understanding of the environment through neural networks. However, both fields face challenges caused by the environment such as motion blur, lighting changes, repetitive patterns, and feature-less structures. This study aims to address these challenges by incorporating additional information and regularizing the absolute pose using relative pose regression (RPR) methods. RPR methods suffer under different challenges, i.e., motion blur. The optical flow between consecutive images is computed using the Lucas-Kanade algorithm, and the relative pose is predicted using an auxiliary small recurrent convolutional network. The fusion of absolute and relative poses is a complex task due to the mismatch between the global and local coordinate systems. State-of-the-art methods fusing absolute and relative poses use pose graph optimization (PGO) to regularize the absolute pose predictions using relative poses. In this work, we propose recurrent fusion networks to optimally align absolute and relative pose predictions to improve the absolute pose prediction. We evaluate eight different recurrent units and construct a simulation environment to pre-train the APR and RPR networks for better generalized training. Additionally, we record a large database of different scenarios in a challenging large-scale indoor environment that mimics a warehouse with transportation robots. We conduct hyperparameter searches and experiments to show the effectiveness of our recurrent fusion method compared to PGO.</p></details> |  |

Optimal graph filters rely on Laplacian eigendecomposition for Fourier transform. In an attempt to avert prohibitive computations, numerous polynomial filters have been proposed. However, polynomials in the majority of these filters are predefined and remain fixed across different graphs, failing to accommodate the varying degrees of heterophily. Addressing this gap, we demystify the intrinsic correlation between the spectral property of desired polynomial bases and the heterophily degrees via thorough theoretical analyses. Subsequently, we develop a novel adaptive heterophily basis wherein the basis vectors mutually form angles reflecting the heterophily degree of the graph. We integrate this heterophily basis with the homophily basis to construct a universal polynomial basis UniBasis, which devises a polynomial filter based graph neural network - UniFilter. It optimizes the convolution and propagation in GNN, thus effectively limiting over-smoothing and alleviating over-squashing. Our extensive experiments, conducted on a diverse range of real-world and synthetic datasets with varying degrees of heterophily, support the superiority of UniFilter. These results not only demonstrate the universality of UniBasis but also highlight its proficiency in graph explanation.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2311.18177</p></details> |
| **[AirIMU: Learning Uncertainty Propagation for Inertial Odometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04874v4)** | 2024-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inertial odometry (IO) using strap-down inertial measurement units (IMUs) is critical in many robotic applications where precise orientation and position tracking are essential. Prior kinematic motion model-based IO methods often use a simplified linearized IMU noise model and thus usually encounter difficulties in modeling non-deterministic errors arising from environmental disturbances and mechanical defects. In contrast, data-driven IO methods struggle to accurately model the sensor motions, often leading to generalizability and interoperability issues. To address these challenges, we present AirIMU, a hybrid approach to estimate the uncertainty, especially the non-deterministic errors, by data-driven methods and increase the generalization abilities using model-based methods. We demonstrate the adaptability of AirIMU using a full spectrum of IMUs, from low-cost automotive grades to high-end navigation grades. We also validate its effectiveness on various platforms, including hand-held devices, vehicles, and a helicopter that covers a trajectory of 262 kilometers. In the ablation study, we validate the effectiveness of our learned uncertainty in an IMU-GPS pose graph optimization experiment, achieving a 31.6\% improvement in accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that jointly training the IMU noise correction and uncertainty estimation synergistically benefits both tasks.</p></details> |  |

Solutions such as pre-training and domain-specific fine-tuning add substantial computational overhead, requiring further domain expertise. Here, we introduce a token-optimized and robust Knowledge Graph-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (KG-RAG) framework by leveraging a massive biomedical KG (SPOKE) with LLMs such as Llama-2-13b, GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4, to generate meaningful biomedical text rooted in established knowledge. Compared to the existing RAG technique for Knowledge Graphs, the proposed method utilizes minimal graph schema for context extraction and uses embedding methods for context pruning. This optimization in context extraction results in more than 50% reduction in token consumption without compromising the accuracy, making a cost-effective and robust RAG implementation on proprietary LLMs. KG-RAG consistently enhanced the performance of LLMs across diverse biomedical prompts by generating responses rooted in established knowledge, accompanied by accurate provenance and statistical evidence (if available) to substantiate the claims. Further benchmarking on human curated datasets, such as biomedical true/false and multiple-choice questions (MCQ), showed a remarkable 71% boost in the performance of the Llama-2 model on the challenging MCQ dataset, demonstrating the framework's capacity to empower open-source models with fewer parameters for domain specific questions. Furthermore, KG-RAG enhanced the performance of proprietary GPT models, such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. In summary, the proposed framework combines explicit and implicit knowledge of KG and LLM in a token optimized fashion, thus enhancing the adaptability of general-purpose LLMs to tackle domain-specific questions in a cost-effective fashion.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 5 figures, 1 table, 1 supplementary file</p></details> |

Previous studies have demonstrated that, while incorporating guidance, such as highways, can accelerate MAPF algorithms, this often results in a trade-off with solution quality. In addition, how to generate good guidance automatically remains largely unexplored, with current methods falling short of surpassing manually designed ones. In this work, we introduce the guidance graph as a versatile representation of guidance for lifelong MAPF, framing Guidance Graph Optimization as the task of optimizing its edge weights. We present two GGO algorithms to automatically generate guidance for arbitrary lifelong MAPF algorithms and maps. The first method directly optimizes edge weights, while the second method optimizes an update model capable of generating edge weights. Empirically, we show that (1) our guidance graphs improve the throughput of three representative lifelong MAPF algorithms in eight benchmark maps, and (2) our update model can generate guidance graphs for as large as $93 \times 91$ maps and as many as 3,000 agents.

However, most existing HGNNs rely on spatial domain-based methods to aggregate information, i.e., manually selected meta-paths or some heuristic modules, lacking theoretical guarantees. Furthermore, these methods cannot learn arbitrary valid heterogeneous graph filters within the spectral domain, which have limited expressiveness. To tackle these issues, we present a positive spectral heterogeneous graph convolution via positive noncommutative polynomials. Then, using this convolution, we propose PSHGCN, a novel Positive Spectral Heterogeneous Graph Convolutional Network. PSHGCN offers a simple yet effective method for learning valid heterogeneous graph filters. Moreover, we demonstrate the rationale of PSHGCN in the graph optimization framework. We conducted an extensive experimental study to show that PSHGCN can learn diverse heterogeneous graph filters and outperform all baselines on open benchmarks. Notably, PSHGCN exhibits remarkable scalability, efficiently handling large real-world graphs comprising millions of nodes and edges.

However, its performance under varying network setups, especially when combined with IMU data for real-time localization, has not been fully explored so far. In this study, we develop an error state Kalman filter (ESKF) and a pose graph optimization (PGO) approach to address this gap. We systematically evaluate the performance of the derived approaches for real-time MAV localization in realistic scenarios with 5G base stations in Line-Of-Sight (LOS), demonstrating the potential of 5G technologies in this domain. In order to experimentally test and compare our localization approaches, we augment the EuRoC MAV benchmark dataset for visual-inertial odometry with simulated yet highly realistic 5G ToA measurements. Our experimental results comprehensively assess the impact of varying network setups, including varying base station numbers and network configurations, on ToA-based MAV localization performance. The findings show promising results for seamless and robust localization using 5G ToA measurements, achieving an accuracy of 15 cm throughout the entire trajectory within a graph-based framework with five 5G base stations, and an accuracy of up to 34 cm in the case of ESKF-based localization. Additionally, we measure the run time of both algorithms and show that they are both fast enough for real-time implementation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tightly-Coupled VLP/INS Integrated Navigation by Inclination Estimation and Blockage Handling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18105v1)** | 2024-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visible Light Positioning (VLP) has emerged as a promising technology capable of delivering indoor localization with high accuracy. In VLP systems that use Photodiodes (PDs) as light receivers, the Received Signal Strength (RSS) is affected by the incidence angle of light, making the inclination of PDs a critical parameter in the positioning model. Currently, most studies assume the inclination to be constant, limiting the applications and positioning accuracy. Additionally, light blockages may severely interfere with the RSS measurements but the literature has not explored blockage detection in real-world experiments. To address these problems, we propose a tightly coupled VLP/INS (Inertial Navigation System) integrated navigation system that uses graph optimization to account for varying PD inclinations and VLP blockages. We also discussed the possibility of simultaneously estimating the robot's pose and the locations of some unknown LEDs. Simulations and two groups of real-world experiments demonstrate the efficiency of our approach, achieving an average positioning accuracy of 10 cm during movement and inclination accuracy within 1 degree despite inclination changes and blockages.</p></details> |  |
| **[Proteus: Preserving Model Confidentiality during Graph Optimizations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12512v1)** | 2024-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning (DL) models have revolutionized numerous domains, yet optimizing them for computational efficiency remains a challenging endeavor. Development of new DL models typically involves two parties: the model developers and performance optimizers. The collaboration between the parties often necessitates the model developers exposing the model architecture and computational graph to the optimizers. However, this exposure is undesirable since the model architecture is an important intellectual property, and its innovations require significant investments and expertise. During the exchange, the model is also vulnerable to adversarial attacks via model stealing. This paper presents Proteus, a novel mechanism that enables model optimization by an independent party while preserving the confidentiality of the model architecture. Proteus obfuscates the protected model by partitioning its computational graph into subgraphs and concealing each subgraph within a large pool of generated realistic subgraphs that cannot be easily distinguished from the original. We evaluate Proteus on a range of DNNs, demonstrating its efficacy in preserving confidentiality without compromising performance optimization opportunities. Proteus effectively hides the model as one alternative among up to $10^{32}$ possible model architectures, and is resilient against attacks with a learning-based adversary. We also demonstrate that heuristic based and manual approaches are ineffective in identifying the protected model. To our knowledge, Proteus is the first work that tackles the challenge of model confidentiality during performance optimization. Proteus will be open-sourced for direct use and experimentation, with easy integration with compilers such as ONNXRuntime.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce a novel methodology that extends state-of-the-art Pose Graph Optimization (PGO) techniques. Departing from the conventional PGO paradigm, which primarily relies on camera-camera edges, our approach centers on the introduction of a dynamic element - any rigid object free to move in the scene - whose pose can be reliably inferred from a single image. Specifically, we consider the bipartite graph encompassing cameras, object poses evolving dynamically, and camera-object relative transformations at each time step. This shift not only offers a solution to the challenges encountered in directly estimating relative poses between cameras, particularly in adverse environments, but also leverages the inclusion of numerous object poses to ameliorate and integrate errors, resulting in accurate camera pose estimates. Though our framework retains compatibility with traditional PGO solvers, its efficacy benefits from a custom-tailored optimization scheme. To this end, we introduce an iterative primal-dual algorithm, capable of handling large graphs. Empirical benchmarks, conducted on a new dataset of simulated indoor environments, substantiate the efficacy and efficiency of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), 2024</p></details> |
| **[MV-ROPE: Multi-view Constraints for Robust Category-level Object Pose and Size Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08856v3)** | 2024-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently there has been a growing interest in category-level object pose and size estimation, and prevailing methods commonly rely on single view RGB-D images. However, one disadvantage of such methods is that they require accurate depth maps which cannot be produced by consumer-grade sensors. Furthermore, many practical real-world situations involve a moving camera that continuously observes its surroundings, and the temporal information of the input video streams is simply overlooked by single-view methods. We propose a novel solution that makes use of RGB video streams. Our framework consists of three modules: a scale-aware monocular dense SLAM solution, a lightweight object pose predictor, and an object-level pose graph optimizer. The SLAM module utilizes a video stream and additional scale-sensitive readings to estimate camera poses and metric depth. The object pose predictor then generates canonical object representations from RGB images. The object pose is estimated through geometric registration of these canonical object representations with estimated object depth points. All per-view estimates finally undergo optimization within a pose graph, culminating in the output of robust and accurate canonical object poses. Our experimental results demonstrate that when utilizing public dataset sequences with high-quality depth information, the proposed method exhibits comparable performance to state-of-the-art RGB-D methods. We also collect and evaluate on new datasets containing depth maps of varying quality to further quantitatively benchmark the proposed method alongside previous RGB-D based methods. We demonstrate a significant advantage in scenarios where depth input is absent or the quality of depth sensing is limited.</p></details> |  |
| **[iSLAM: Imperative SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07894v5)** | 2024-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) stands as one of the critical challenges in robot navigation. A SLAM system often consists of a front-end component for motion estimation and a back-end system for eliminating estimation drifts. Recent advancements suggest that data-driven methods are highly effective for front-end tasks, while geometry-based methods continue to be essential in the back-end processes. However, such a decoupled paradigm between the data-driven front-end and geometry-based back-end can lead to sub-optimal performance, consequently reducing the system's capabilities and generalization potential. To solve this problem, we proposed a novel self-supervised imperative learning framework, named imperative SLAM (iSLAM), which fosters reciprocal correction between the front-end and back-end, thus enhancing performance without necessitating any external supervision. Specifically, we formulate the SLAM problem as a bilevel optimization so that the front-end and back-end are bidirectionally connected. As a result, the front-end model can learn global geometric knowledge obtained through pose graph optimization by back-propagating the residuals from the back-end component. We showcase the effectiveness of this new framework through an application of stereo-inertial SLAM. The experiments show that the iSLAM training strategy achieves an accuracy improvement of 22% on average over a baseline model. To the best of our knowledge, iSLAM is the first SLAM system showing that the front-end and back-end components can mutually correct each other in a self-supervised manner.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been accepted by IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)</p></details> |
| **[Distributed Pose-graph Optimization with Multi-level Partitioning for Collaborative SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01657v3)** | 2024-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The back-end module of Distributed Collaborative Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (DCSLAM) requires solving a nonlinear Pose Graph Optimization (PGO) under a distributed setting, also known as SE(d)-synchronization. Most existing distributed graph optimization algorithms employ a simple sequential partitioning scheme, which may result in unbalanced subgraph dimensions due to the different geographic locations of each robot, and hence imposes extra communication load. Moreover, the performance of current Riemannian optimization algorithms can be further accelerated. In this letter, we propose a novel distributed pose graph optimization algorithm combining multi-level partitioning with an accelerated Riemannian optimization method. Firstly, we employ the multi-level graph partitioning algorithm to preprocess the naive pose graph to formulate a balanced optimization problem. In addition, inspired by the accelerated coordinate descent method, we devise an Improved Riemannian Block Coordinate Descent (IRBCD) algorithm and the critical point obtained is globally optimal. Finally, we evaluate the effects of four common graph partitioning approaches on the correlation of the inter-subgraphs, and discover that the Highest scheme has the best partitioning performance. Also, we implement simulations to quantitatively demonstrate that our proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art distributed pose graph optimization protocols.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unifews: Unified Entry-Wise Sparsification for Efficient Graph Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13268v1)** | 2024-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown promising performance in various graph learning tasks, but at the cost of resource-intensive computations. The primary overhead of GNN update stems from graph propagation and weight transformation, both involving operations on graph-scale matrices. Previous studies attempt to reduce the computational budget by leveraging graph-level or network-level sparsification techniques, resulting in downsized graph or weights. In this work, we propose Unifews, which unifies the two operations in an entry-wise manner considering individual matrix elements, and conducts joint edge-weight sparsification to enhance learning efficiency. The entry-wise design of Unifews enables adaptive compression across GNN layers with progressively increased sparsity, and is applicable to a variety of architectural designs with on-the-fly operation simplification. Theoretically, we establish a novel framework to characterize sparsified GNN learning in view of a graph optimization process, and prove that Unifews effectively approximates the learning objective with bounded error and reduced computational load. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of our method in diverse settings. Unifews is advantageous in jointly removing more than 90% of edges and weight entries with comparable or better accuracy than baseline models.

For 3D multi-object tracking, recent approaches process a single measurement frame recursively with greedy association and are prone to errors in ambiguous association decisions. Our method, Sliding Window Tracker (SWTrack), yields more accurate association and state estimation by batch processing many frames of sensor data while being capable of running online in real-time. The most probable track associations are identified by evaluating all possible track hypotheses across the temporal sliding window. A novel graph optimization approach is formulated to solve the multidimensional assignment problem with lifted graph edges introduced to account for missed detections and graph sparsity enforced to retain real-time efficiency. We evaluate our SWTrack implementation$^{2}$ on the NuScenes autonomous driving dataset to demonstrate improved tracking performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICRA 2024</p></details> |

To overcome this challenge, we propose Pose-refined Rotation Averaging Graph Optimization (PRAGO). From a set of objectness detections on unordered images, our method reconstructs the rotational pose, and in turn, the absolute pose, in a differentiable manner benefiting from the optimization of a sequence of geometrical tasks. We show how our objectness pose-refinement module in PRAGO is able to refine the inherent ambiguities in pairwise relative pose estimation without removing edges and avoiding making early decisions on the viability of graph edges. PRAGO then refines the absolute rotations through iterative graph construction, reweighting the graph edges to compute the final rotational pose, which can be converted into absolute poses using translation averaging. We show that PRAGO is able to outperform non-differentiable solvers on small and sparse scenes extracted from 7-Scenes achieving a relative improvement of 21% for rotations while achieving similar translation estimates.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods can struggle when dealing with uninformative geometric structures in challenging scenarios. This paper presents RELEAD, a LiDAR-centric solution designed to address scan-matching degradation. Our method enables degeneracy-free point cloud registration by solving constrained ESIKF updates in the front end and incorporates multisensor constraints, even when dealing with outlier measurements, through graph optimization based on Graduated Non-Convexity (GNC). Additionally, we propose a robust Incremental Fixed Lag Smoother (rIFL) for efficient GNC-based optimization.

| **[An Effective Universal Polynomial Basis for Spectral Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18177v2)** | 2024-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spectral Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), also referred to as graph filters have gained increasing prevalence for heterophily graphs. Optimal graph filters rely on Laplacian eigendecomposition for Fourier transform. In an attempt to avert the prohibitive computations, numerous polynomial filters by leveraging distinct polynomials have been proposed to approximate the desired graph filters. However, polynomials in the majority of polynomial filters are predefined and remain fixed across all graphs, failing to accommodate the diverse heterophily degrees across different graphs. To tackle this issue, we first investigate the correlation between polynomial bases of desired graph filters and the degrees of graph heterophily via a thorough theoretical analysis. Afterward, we develop an adaptive heterophily basis by incorporating graph heterophily degrees. Subsequently, we integrate this heterophily basis with the homophily basis, creating a universal polynomial basis UniBasis. In consequence, we devise a general polynomial filter UniFilter. Comprehensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets with varying heterophily degrees significantly support the superiority of UniFilter, demonstrating the effectiveness and generality of UniBasis, as well as its promising capability as a new method for graph analysis.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce a centralized system to facilitate collaborative LiDAR-ranging-inertial state estimation, enabling robotic swarms to operate without the need for anchor deployment. The system efficiently distributes computationally intensive tasks to a central server, thereby reducing the computational burden on individual robots for local odometry calculations. The server back-end establishes a global reference by leveraging shared data and refining joint pose graph optimization through place recognition, global optimization techniques, and removal of outlier data to ensure precise and robust collaborative state estimation. Extensive evaluations of our system, utilizing both publicly available datasets and our custom datasets, demonstrate significant enhancements in the accuracy of collaborative SLAM estimates. Moreover, our system exhibits remarkable proficiency in large-scale missions, seamlessly enabling ten robots to collaborate effectively in performing SLAM tasks.

| **[Fully Dynamic Geometric Vertex Cover and Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07441v2)** | 2024-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we study two fundamental graph optimization problems, minimum vertex cover (MVC) and maximum-cardinality matching (MCM), for intersection graphs of geometric objects, e.g., disks, rectangles, hypercubes, etc., in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space. We consider the problems in fully dynamic settings, allowing insertions and deletions of objects. We develop a general framework for dynamic MVC in intersection graphs, achieving sublinear amortized update time for most natural families of geometric objects. In particular, we show that - - For a dynamic collection of disks in $\mathbb{R}^2$ or hypercubes in $\mathbb{R}^d$ (for constant $d$), it is possible to maintain a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximate vertex cover in polylog amortized update time. These results also hold in the bipartite case. - For a dynamic collection of rectangles in $\mathbb{R}^2$, it is possible to maintain a $(\frac{3}{2}+\varepsilon)$-approximate vertex cover in polylog amortized update time. Along the way, we obtain the first near-linear time static algorithms for MVC in the above two cases with the same approximation factors. Next, we turn our attention to the MCM problem. Although our MVC algorithms automatically allow us to approximate the size of the MCM in bipartite geometric intersection graphs, they do not produce a matching. We give another general framework to maintain an approximate maximum matching, and further extend the approach to handle non-bipartite intersection graphs. In particular, we show that - - For a dynamic collection of (bichromatic or monochromatic) disks in $\mathbb{R}^2$ or hypercubes in $\mathbb{R}^d$ (for constant $d$), it is possible to maintain a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximate matching in polylog amortized update time.</p></details> | 25 Pages |

However, the BA method has not yet been properly employed in a dead-reckoning navigation system. In this paper, we present a frame-to-frame (F2F) BA for LiDAR-inertial navigation, named BA-LINS. Based on the direct F2F point-cloud association, the same-plane points are associated among the LiDAR keyframes. Hence, the F2F plane-point BA measurement can be constructed using the same-plane points. The LiDAR BA and the inertial measurement unit (IMU)-preintegration measurements are tightly integrated under the framework of factor graph optimization. An effective adaptive covariance estimation algorithm for LiDAR BA measurements is proposed to further improve the accuracy. We conduct exhaustive real-world experiments on public and private datasets to examine the proposed BA-LINS. The results demonstrate that BA-LINS yields superior accuracy to state-of-the-art methods. Compared to the baseline system FF-LINS, the absolute translation accuracy and state-estimation efficiency of BA-LINS are improved by 29.5% and 28.7% on the private dataset, respectively. Besides, the ablation experiment results exhibit that the proposed adaptive covariance estimation algorithm can notably improve the accuracy and robustness of BA-LINS.</p></details> | 14 pages, 14 figures |

However, current research faces challenges in accurately localizing and mapping in planar ambiguous scenes, primarily due to the poor accuracy of the employed planar features and data association methods. In this paper, we propose a visual SLAM system based on planar features designed for planar ambiguous scenes, encompassing planar processing, data association, and multi-constraint factor graph optimization. We introduce a planar processing strategy that integrates semantic information with planar features, extracting the edges and vertices of planes to be utilized in tasks such as plane selection, data association, and pose optimization. Next, we present an integrated data association strategy that combines plane parameters, semantic information, projection IoU (Intersection over Union), and non-parametric tests, achieving accurate and robust plane data association in planar ambiguous scenes. Finally, we design a set of multi-constraint factor graphs for camera pose optimization. Qualitative and quantitative experiments conducted on publicly available datasets demonstrate that our proposed system competes effectively in both accuracy and robustness in terms of map construction and camera localization compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

The proposed algorithm tightly couples scan-to-scan and scan-to-map point cloud registration factors along with IMU factors on a sliding window factor graph. The tight coupling of the scan-to-scan and scan-to-map registration factors enables a smooth fusion of sensor ego-motion estimation and map-based trajectory correction that results in robust tracking of the sensor pose under severe point cloud degeneration and defective regions in a map. We also propose an initial sensor state estimation algorithm that robustly estimates the gravity direction and IMU state and helps perform global localization in 3- or 4-DoF for system initialization without prior position information. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in extremely severe situations where the point cloud data becomes degenerate, there are momentary sensor interruptions, or the sensor moves along the map boundary or into unmapped regions.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA2024)</p></details> |

Cooperative localization involves enhancing each robot's information through a communication network and message passing. If odometry data from a target robot can be transmitted to the ego robot, observability of their relative pose estimation can be achieved through range-only or bearing-only measurements, provided both robots have non-zero linear velocities. In cases where odometry data from a target robot are not directly transmitted but estimated by the ego robot, both range and bearing measurements are necessary to ensure observability of relative pose estimation. For ROS/Gazebo simulations, we explore four sensing and communication structures. We compare extended Kalman filtering (EKF) and pose graph optimization (PGO) estimation using different robust loss functions (filtering and smoothing with varying batch sizes of sliding windows) in terms of estimation accuracy. In hardware experiments, two Turtlebot3 equipped with UWB modules are used for real-world inter-robot relative pose estimation, applying both EKF and PGO and comparing their performance.</p></details> | 20 pages, 21 figures |

Every node is associated with a critical time and the length of every cycle must not exceed the critical time of any node in the cycle. We formulate LCCP as a set partitioning model and solve it using an exact branch-and-price approach. We use a dynamic programming-based pricing algorithm to generate improving cycles, exploiting the particular structure of the pricing problem for efficient bidirectional search and symmetry breaking. Computational results show that the LP relaxation of the set partitioning model produces strong dual bounds and our branch-and-price method improves significantly over the state of the art. It is able to solve closed instances in a fraction of the previously needed time and closes 13 previously unsolved instances, one of which has 76 nodes, a notable improvement over the previous limit of 52 nodes.</p></details> |  |

With the remarkable achievements of node embedding-based Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), we explore the upper bounds of expressiveness inherent to embedding-based methodologies and tackle the challenges by reframing the CF task as a graph signal processing problem. To this end, we propose PolyCF, a flexible graph signal filter that leverages polynomial graph filters to process interaction signals. PolyCF exhibits the capability to capture spectral features across multiple eigenspaces through a series of Generalized Gram filters and is able to approximate the optimal polynomial response function for recovering missing interactions. A graph optimization objective and a pair-wise ranking objective are jointly used to optimize the parameters of the convolution kernel. Experiments on three widely adopted datasets demonstrate the superiority of PolyCF over current state-of-the-art CF methods. Moreover, comprehensive studies empirically validate each component's efficacy in the proposed PolyCF.</p></details> |  |

In general, it involves the nonlinear estimation of hidden variables that represent the system's state. However, in the presence of measurement outliers, the standard nonlinear least squared formulation results in poor estimates. Several methods have been considered in the literature to improve the reliability of the estimation process. Most methods are based on heuristics since guaranteed global robust estimation is not generally practical due to high computational costs. Recently general purpose robust estimation heuristics have been proposed that leverage existing non-minimal solvers available for the outlier-free formulations without the need for an initial guess. In this work, we propose three Bayesian heuristics that have similar structures. We evaluate these heuristics in practical scenarios to demonstrate their merits in different applications including 3D point cloud registration, mesh registration and pose graph optimization. The general computational advantages our proposals offer make them attractive candidates for spatial perception tasks.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures |

We focus on the automatic operation of articulated six-wheel dump trucks at construction sites. For the automatic operation of the dump trucks, it is important to estimate the position and the articulated angle of the dump trucks with high accuracy. In this study, we propose a method for estimating the state of a dump truck by using four global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs) installed on an articulated dump truck and a graph optimization method that utilizes the redundancy of multiple GNSSs. By adding real-time kinematic (RTK)-GNSS constraints and geometric constraints between the four antennas, the proposed method can robustly estimate the position and articulation angle even in environments where GNSS satellites are partially blocked. As a result of evaluating the accuracy of the proposed method through field tests, it was confirmed that the articulated angle could be estimated with an accuracy of 0.1$^\circ$ in an open-sky environment and 0.7$^\circ$ in a mountainous area simulating an elevation angle of 45$^\circ$ where GNSS satellites are blocked.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an electronic version of an article published in ADVANCED ROBOTICS, 35:23, 1376-1387, 2021.

Although effective for accurate visual odometry in complex scenarios, these methods discard crucial information about moving objects. By incorporating this information into a Dynamic SLAM framework, the motion of dynamic entities can be estimated, enhancing navigation whilst ensuring accurate localization. However, the fundamental formulation of Dynamic SLAM remains an open challenge, with no consensus on the optimal approach for accurate motion estimation within a SLAM pipeline. Therefore, we developed DynoSAM, an open-source framework for Dynamic SLAM that enables the efficient implementation, testing, and comparison of various Dynamic SLAM optimization formulations. DynoSAM integrates static and dynamic measurements into a unified optimization problem solved using factor graphs, simultaneously estimating camera poses, static scene, object motion or poses, and object structures. We evaluate DynoSAM across diverse simulated and real-world datasets, achieving state-of-the-art motion estimation in indoor and outdoor environments, with substantial improvements over existing systems. Additionally, we demonstrate DynoSAM utility in downstream applications, including 3D reconstruction of dynamic scenes and trajectory prediction, thereby showcasing potential for advancing dynamic object-aware SLAM systems. DynoSAM is open-sourced at https://github.com/ACFR-RPG/DynOSAM.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 10 figures. Submitted to T-RO Visual SLAM SI 2025</p></details> |

While recent advancements in dense SLAM have leveraged Gaussian Splatting to enhance scene representation, most approaches assume a static environment, making them vulnerable to photometric and geometric inconsistencies caused by dynamic objects. To address these challenges, we integrate Gaussian Splatting SLAM with a robust filtering process to handle dynamic objects throughout the entire pipeline, including Gaussian insertion and keyframe selection. Within this framework, to further improve the accuracy of dynamic object removal, we introduce a robust mask generation method that enforces photometric consistency across keyframes, reducing noise from inaccurate segmentation and artifacts such as shadows. Additionally, we propose the loop-aware window selection mechanism, which utilizes unique keyframe IDs of 3D Gaussians to detect loops between the current and past frames, facilitating joint optimization of the current camera poses and the Gaussian map. DGS-SLAM achieves state-of-the-art performance in both camera tracking and novel view synthesis on various dynamic SLAM benchmarks, proving its effectiveness in handling real-world dynamic scenes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, Under review</p></details> |

However, their performance significantly deteriorates when deployed in settings with a higher presence of movable objects, such as environments with pedestrians, cars, and buses, which are common in outdoor scenes. To address this issue, we propose a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)-based real-time stereo SLAM system that leverages complete geometry information to avoid information loss. Moreover, there is currently no publicly available dataset for directly evaluating the effectiveness of dynamic and static feature classification methods, and to bridge this gap, we have created a publicly available dataset containing over 50,000 feature points. Experimental results demonstrate that our MLP-based dynamic and static feature point discriminator has achieved superior performance compared to other methods on this dataset. Furthermore, the MLP-based real-time stereo SLAM system has shown the highest average precision and fastest speed on the outdoor KITTI tracking datasets compared to other dynamic SLAM systems.The open-source code and datasets are available at https://github.com/TaozheLi/MLP-SLAM.</p></details> | Dynamic SLAM |

To enable robots to safely navigate and plan in dynamic environments, it is essential to employ representations capable of handling moving objects. Dynamic SLAM is an emerging field in SLAM research as it improves the overall system accuracy while providing additional estimation of object motions. State-of-the-art literature informs two main formulations for Dynamic SLAM, representing dynamic object points in either the world or object coordinate frame. While expressing object points in a local reference frame may seem intuitive, it may not necessarily lead to the most accurate and robust solutions. This paper conducts and presents a thorough analysis of various Dynamic SLAM formulations, identifying the best approach to address the problem. To this end, we introduce a front-end agnostic framework using GTSAM that can be used to evaluate various Dynamic SLAM formulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, accepted by ICRA 2024</p></details> |

This paper proposes a time-varying representation to track and reconstruct the dynamic scenes. Firstly, two processes, a tracking process and a mapping process, are maintained simultaneously in our framework. In the tracking process, all input images are uniformly sampled and then progressively trained in a self-supervised paradigm. In the mapping process, we leverage motion masks to distinguish dynamic objects from the static background, and sample more pixels from dynamic areas. Secondly, the parameter optimization for both processes is comprised of two stages: the first stage associates time with 3D positions to convert the deformation field to the canonical field. The second stage associates time with the embeddings of the canonical field to obtain colors and a Signed Distance Function (SDF). Lastly, we propose a novel keyframe selection strategy based on the overlapping rate. Our approach is evaluated on two synthetic datasets and one real-world dataset, and the experiments validate that our method achieves competitive results in both tracking and mapping when compared to existing state-of-the-art NeRF-based dynamic SLAM systems.</p></details> |  |

However, they usually require GPUs to operate in real-time. Therefore, this paper proposes an open-source real-time dynamic SLAM system that runs solely on CPU by incorporating a mask prediction mechanism, which allows the deep learning method and the camera tracking to run entirely in parallel at different frequencies. Our SLAM system further introduces a dual-stage optical flow tracking approach and employs a hybrid usage of optical flow and ORB features, enhancing efficiency and robustness by selectively allocating computational resources to input frames. Compared with previous methods, our system maintains high localization accuracy in dynamic environments while achieving a tracking frame rate of 56 FPS on a laptop CPU, proving that deep learning methods are feasible for dynamic SLAM without GPU support. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first SLAM system to achieve this.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |

| **[Learn to Memorize and to Forget: A Continual Learning Perspective of Dynamic SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13338v1)** | 2024-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) with implicit neural representations has received extensive attention due to the expressive representation power and the innovative paradigm of continual learning. However, deploying such a system within a dynamic environment has not been well-studied. Such challenges are intractable even for conventional algorithms since observations from different views with dynamic objects involved break the geometric and photometric consistency, whereas the consistency lays the foundation for joint optimizing the camera pose and the map parameters. In this paper, we best exploit the characteristics of continual learning and propose a novel SLAM framework for dynamic environments. While past efforts have been made to avoid catastrophic forgetting by exploiting an experience replay strategy, we view forgetting as a desirable characteristic. By adaptively controlling the replayed buffer, the ambiguity caused by moving objects can be easily alleviated through forgetting. We restrain the replay of the dynamic objects by introducing a continually-learned classifier for dynamic object identification. The iterative optimization of the neural map and the classifier notably improves the robustness of the SLAM system under a dynamic environment.

However, this approach relies on a static environment assumption and does not work robustly within a dynamic environment due to the inconsistent observation of geometry and photometry. To address the challenges presented in dynamic environments, we propose a novel dynamic SLAM framework with neural radiance field. Specifically, we introduce a motion mask generation method to filter out the invalid sampled rays. This design effectively fuses the optical flow mask and semantic mask to enhance the precision of motion mask. To further improve the accuracy of pose estimation, we have designed a divide-and-conquer pose optimization algorithm that distinguishes between keyframes and non-keyframes. The proposed edge warp loss can effectively enhance the geometry constraints between adjacent frames. Extensive experiments are conducted on the two challenging datasets, and the results show that RoDyn-SLAM achieves state-of-the-art performance among recent neural RGB-D methods in both accuracy and robustness.</p></details> | IEEE RAL 2024 |
| **[Khronos: A Unified Approach for Spatio-Temporal Metric-Semantic SLAM in Dynamic Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13817v2)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Perceiving and understanding highly dynamic and changing environments is a crucial capability for robot autonomy. While large strides have been made towards developing dynamic SLAM approaches that estimate the robot pose accurately, a lesser emphasis has been put on the construction of dense spatio-temporal representations of the robot environment. A detailed understanding of the scene and its evolution through time is crucial for long-term robot autonomy and essential to tasks that require long-term reasoning, such as operating effectively in environments shared with humans and other agents and thus are subject to short and long-term dynamics. To address this challenge, this work defines the Spatio-temporal Metric-semantic SLAM (SMS) problem, and presents a framework to factorize and solve it efficiently. We show that the proposed factorization suggests a natural organization of a spatio-temporal perception system, where a fast process tracks short-term dynamics in an active temporal window, while a slower process reasons over long-term changes in the environment using a factor graph formulation. We provide an efficient implementation of the proposed spatio-temporal perception approach, that we call Khronos, and show that it unifies exiting interpretations of short-term and long-term dynamics and is able to construct a dense spatio-temporal map in real-time. We provide simulated and real results, showing that the spatio-temporal maps built by Khronos are an accurate reflection of a 3D scene over time and that Khronos outperforms baselines across multiple metrics. We further validate our approach on two heterogeneous robots in challenging, large-scale real-world environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Robotics: Science and Systems, 2024.

This paper develops a real-time multi-object tracking and prediction system in rugged environments. A 3D object detection algorithm based on Lidar-camera fusion is designed to detect the target objects. Based on the Hungarian algorithm, this paper designs a 3D multi-object tracking algorithm with an adaptive threshold to realize the stable matching and tracking of the objects. We combine Memory Augmented Neural Networks (MANN) and Kalman filter to achieve 3D trajectory prediction on rugged terrains. Besides, we realize a new dynamic SLAM by using the results of multi-object tracking to remove dynamic points for better SLAM performance and static map. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed multi-object tracking and prediction system, several simulations and physical experiments are conducted. The results show that the proposed system can track dynamic objects and provide future trajectory and a more clean static map in real-time.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 Pag...</summary><p>6 Pages, 8 figures, submitted to ROBIO2023</p></details> |
| **[Simulation of Dynamic Environments for SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04286v2)** | 2023-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulation engines are widely adopted in robotics. However, they lack either full simulation control, ROS integration, realistic physics, or photorealism. Recently, synthetic data generation and realistic rendering has advanced tasks like target tracking and human pose estimation. However, when focusing on vision applications, there is usually a lack of information like sensor measurements or time continuity. On the other hand, simulations for most robotics tasks are performed in (semi)static environments, with specific sensors and low visual fidelity. To solve this, we introduced in our previous work a fully customizable framework for generating realistic animated dynamic environments (GRADE) [1]. We use GRADE to generate an indoor dynamic environment dataset and then compare multiple SLAM algorithms on different sequences. By doing that, we show how current research over-relies on known benchmarks, failing to generalize. Our tests with refined YOLO and Mask R-CNN models provide further evidence that additional research in dynamic SLAM is necessary.

| **[RGB-D-Inertial SLAM in Indoor Dynamic Environments with Long-term Large Occlusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13316v1)** | 2023-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work presents a novel RGB-D-inertial dynamic SLAM method that can enable accurate localisation when the majority of the camera view is occluded by multiple dynamic objects over a long period of time. Most dynamic SLAM approaches either remove dynamic objects as outliers when they account for a minor proportion of the visual input, or detect dynamic objects using semantic segmentation before camera tracking. Therefore, dynamic objects that cause large occlusions are difficult to detect without prior information. The remaining visual information from the static background is also not enough to support localisation when large occlusion lasts for a long period. To overcome these problems, our framework presents a robust visual-inertial bundle adjustment that simultaneously tracks camera, estimates cluster-wise dense segmentation of dynamic objects and maintains a static sparse map by combining dense and sparse features. The experiment results demonstrate that our method achieves promising localisation and object segmentation performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods in the scenario of long-term large occlusion.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |

Recent SLAM frameworks have been proposed to simultaneously track the camera and moving objects. However they are often unable to estimate the canonical pose of the objects and exhibit a low object tracking accuracy. To solve this problem we propose TwistSLAM++, a semantic, dynamic, SLAM system that fuses stereo images and LiDAR information. Using semantic information, we track potentially moving objects and associate them to 3D object detections in LiDAR scans to obtain their pose and size. Then, we perform registration on consecutive object scans to refine object pose estimation. Finally, object scans are used to estimate the shape of the object and constrain map points to lie on the estimated surface within the BA. We show on classical benchmarks that this fusion approach based on multimodal information improves the accuracy of object tracking.</p></details> |  |

Many of these applications require autonomous agents to perform SLAM in highly dynamic scenes. To this end, this tutorial extends a recently introduced, unifying optimization-based SLAM backend framework to environments with moving objects and features. Using this framework, we consider a rapprochement of recent advances in dynamic SLAM. Moreover, we present dynamic EKF SLAM: a novel, filtering-based dynamic SLAM algorithm generated from our framework, and prove that it is mathematically equivalent to a direct extension of the classical EKF SLAM algorithm to the dynamic environment setting. Empirical results with simulated data indicate that dynamic EKF SLAM can achieve high localization and mobile object pose estimation accuracy, as well as high map precision, with high efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Amos-SLAM: An Anti-Dynamics Two-stage SLAM Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11747v1)** | 2023-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The traditional Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) systems rely on the assumption of a static environment and fail to accurately estimate the system's location when dynamic objects are present in the background. While learning-based dynamic SLAM systems have difficulties in handling unknown moving objects, geometry-based methods have limited success in addressing the residual effects of unidentified dynamic objects on location estimation. To address these issues, we propose an anti-dynamics two-stage SLAM approach. Firstly, the potential motion regions of both prior and non-prior dynamic objects are extracted and pose estimates for dynamic discrimination are quickly obtained using optical flow tracking and model generation methods. Secondly, dynamic points in each frame are removed through dynamic judgment. For non-prior dynamic objects, we present a approach that uses super-pixel extraction and geometric clustering to determine the potential motion regions based on color and geometric information in the image. Evaluations on multiple low and high dynamic sequences in a public RGB-D dataset show that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art dynamic SLAM methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[RGB-D SLAM in Indoor Planar Environments with Multiple Large Dynamic Objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02882v2)** | 2022-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work presents a novel dense RGB-D SLAM approach for dynamic planar environments that enables simultaneous multi-object tracking, camera localisation and background reconstruction. Previous dynamic SLAM methods either rely on semantic segmentation to directly detect dynamic objects; or assume that dynamic objects occupy a smaller proportion of the camera view than the static background and can, therefore, be removed as outliers. Our approach, however, enables dense SLAM when the camera view is largely occluded by multiple dynamic objects with the aid of camera motion prior. The dynamic planar objects are separated by their different rigid motions and tracked independently. The remaining dynamic non-planar areas are removed as outliers and not mapped into the background. The evaluation demonstrates that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of localisation, mapping, dynamic segmentation and object tracking. We also demonstrate its robustness to large drift in the camera motion prior.</p></details> | 8 papges, 9 figures |

Dynamic 3D object tracking has then become a significant capability in visual SLAM with the requirement of understanding dynamic surroundings in various scenarios including autonomous driving, augmented and virtual reality. However, performing dynamic SLAM solely with monocular images remains a challenging problem due to the difficulty of associating dynamic features and estimating their positions. In this paper, we present MOTSLAM, a dynamic visual SLAM system with the monocular configuration that tracks both poses and bounding boxes of dynamic objects. MOTSLAM first performs multiple object tracking (MOT) with associated both 2D and 3D bounding box detection to create initial 3D objects. Then, neural-network-based monocular depth estimation is applied to fetch the depth of dynamic features. Finally, camera poses, object poses, and both static, as well as dynamic map points, are jointly optimized using a novel bundle adjustment. Our experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that our system has reached best performance on both camera ego-motion and object tracking on monocular dynamic SLAM.</p></details> |  |

Several SLAM systems with impressive performance have been invented and used during the last several decades. However, there are still unresolved issues, such as how to deal with moving objects in dynamic situations. Classic SLAM systems depend on the assumption of a static environment, which becomes unworkable in highly dynamic situations. Several methods have been presented to tackle this issue in recent years, but each has its limitations. This research combines the visual SLAM systems ORB-SLAM3 and Detectron2 to present the Det-SLAM system, which employs depth information and semantic segmentation to identify and eradicate dynamic spots to accomplish semantic SLAM for dynamic situations. Evaluation of public TUM datasets indicates that Det-SLAM is more resilient than previous dynamic SLAM systems and can lower the estimated error of camera posture in dynamic indoor scenarios.</p></details> | 5 pages, 2 figures |

Existing methods mainly focus on identifying and excluding dynamic objects from the optimization. In this paper, we show that feature-based visual SLAM systems can also benefit from the presence of dynamic articulated objects by taking advantage of two observations: (1) The 3D structure of each rigid part of articulated object remains consistent over time; (2) The points on the same rigid part follow the same motion. In particular, we present AirDOS, a dynamic object-aware system that introduces rigidity and motion constraints to model articulated objects. By jointly optimizing the camera pose, object motion, and the object 3D structure, we can rectify the camera pose estimation, preventing tracking loss, and generate 4D spatio-temporal maps for both dynamic objects and static scenes. Experiments show that our algorithm improves the robustness of visual SLAM algorithms in challenging crowded urban environments. To the best of our knowledge, AirDOS is the first dynamic object-aware SLAM system demonstrating that camera pose estimation can be improved by incorporating dynamic articulated objects.</p></details> |  |

Our system can robustly track and reconstruct the geometries of arbitrary objects, their semantics and motion by incrementally fusing associated colour, depth, semantic, and foreground object probabilities into each object model thanks to its robust sensor and object tracking. In addition, when an object is lost or moved outside the camera field of view, our system can reliably recover its pose upon re-observation. We demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of our method by quantitatively and qualitatively testing it in real-world data sequences.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) 2022</p></details> |

However, most of the current lidar SLAM approaches are based on the assumption of a static environment. Hence the localization in a dynamic environment with multiple moving objects is actually unreliable. The paper proposes a dynamic SLAM framework RF-LIO, building on LIO-SAM, which adds adaptive multi-resolution range images and uses tightly-coupled lidar inertial odometry to first remove moving objects, and then match lidar scan to the submap. Thus, it can obtain accurate poses even in high dynamic environments. The proposed RF-LIO is evaluated on both self-collected datasets and open Urbanloco datasets. The experimental results in high dynamic environments demonstrate that, compared with LOAM and LIO-SAM, the absolute trajectory accuracy of the proposed RF-LIO can be improved by 90% and 70%, respectively. RF-LIO is one of the state-of-the-art SLAM systems in high dynamic environments.</p></details> |  |

Recently, some related works generally use the combination of semantic constraints and geometric constraints to deal with dynamic objects, but problems can still be raised, such as poor real-time performance, easy to treat people as rigid bodies, and poor performance in low dynamic scenes. In this paper, a dynamic scene-oriented visual SLAM algorithm based on object detection and coarse-to-fine static probability named CFP-SLAM is proposed. The algorithm combines semantic constraints and geometric constraints to calculate the static probability of objects, keypoints and map points, and takes them as weights to participate in camera pose estimation. Extensive evaluations show that our approach can achieve almost the best results in high dynamic and low dynamic scenarios compared to the state-of-the-art dynamic SLAM methods, and shows quite high real-time ability.</p></details> |  |

The motion of rigid objects can be typically tracked by exploiting their texture and geometric features. However, humans moving in the scene are often one of the most important, interactive targets - they are very hard to track and reconstruct robustly due to non-rigid shapes. In this work, we present a fast, learning-based human object detector to isolate the dynamic human objects and realise a real-time dense background reconstruction framework. We go further by estimating and reconstructing the human pose and shape. The final output environment maps not only provide the dense static backgrounds but also contain the dynamic human meshes and their trajectories. Our Dynamic SLAM system runs at around 26 frames per second (fps) on GPUs, while additionally turning on accurate human pose estimation can be executed at up to 10 fps.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IROS-2021</p></details> |

Most prior efforts, however, often assume that the target object's CAD model, at least at a category-level, is available for offline training or during online template matching. This work proposes BundleTrack, a general framework for 6D pose tracking of novel objects, which does not depend upon 3D models, either at the instance or category-level. It leverages the complementary attributes of recent advances in deep learning for segmentation and robust feature extraction, as well as memory-augmented pose graph optimization for spatiotemporal consistency. This enables long-term, low-drift tracking under various challenging scenarios, including significant occlusions and object motions. Comprehensive experiments given two public benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-art, category-level 6D tracking or dynamic SLAM methods. When compared against state-of-art methods that rely on an object instance CAD model, comparable performance is achieved, despite the proposed method's reduced information requirements. An efficient implementation in CUDA provides a real-time performance of 10Hz for the entire framework. Code is available at: https://github.com/wenbowen123/BundleTrack</p></details> |  |

However, existing Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) methods generally focus on either geometric or semantic reconstruction. In this paper, we introduce PanoSLAM, the first SLAM system to integrate geometric reconstruction, 3D semantic segmentation, and 3D instance segmentation within a unified framework. Our approach builds upon 3D Gaussian Splatting, modified with several critical components to enable efficient rendering of depth, color, semantic, and instance information from arbitrary viewpoints. To achieve panoptic 3D scene reconstruction from sequential RGB-D videos, we propose an online Spatial-Temporal Lifting (STL) module that transfers 2D panoptic predictions from vision models into 3D Gaussian representations. This STL module addresses the challenges of label noise and inconsistencies in 2D predictions by refining the pseudo labels across multi-view inputs, creating a coherent 3D representation that enhances segmentation accuracy. Our experiments show that PanoSLAM outperforms recent semantic SLAM methods in both mapping and tracking accuracy. For the first time, it achieves panoptic 3D reconstruction of open-world environments directly from the RGB-D video. (https://github.com/runnanchen/PanoSLAM)</p></details> |  |

The framework integrates a data-driven front-end for instance segmentation from either RGBD cameras or LiDARs and a custom back-end for optimizing robot trajectories and object landmarks in the map. To allow multiple robots to merge their information, we design semantics-driven place recognition algorithms that leverage the informativeness and viewpoint invariance of the object-level metric-semantic map for inter-robot loop closure detection. A communication module is designed to track each robot's observations and those of other robots whenever communication links are available. Our framework enables real-time decentralized operations onboard robots, allowing them to leverage communication opportunistically. We integrate the proposed framework with the autonomous navigation and exploration systems of three types of aerial and ground robots, conducting extensive experiments in a variety of indoor and outdoor environments. These experiments demonstrate its accuracy in inter-robot localization and object mapping, along with its moderate demands on computation, storage, and communication resources. The framework is open-sourced and is suitable for both single-agent and multi-robot metric-semantic SLAM applications.

Visual cameras (front-view and surround-view), IMU, and wheel encoder form the input sensor configuration of our system. The first part of our work is GCSLAM. GCSLAM introduces a novel factor graph for the optimization of poses and semantic map, which incorporates innovative error terms based on multi-sensor data and BEV (bird's-eye view) semantic information. Additionally, GCSLAM integrates a Global Slot Management module that stores and manages parking slot observations. SF-Loc is the second part of our work, which leverages the semantic map built by GCSLAM to conduct map-based localization. SF-Loc integrates registration results and odometry poses with a novel factor graph. Our system demonstrates superior performance over existing SLAM on two real-world datasets, showing excellent capabilities in robust global localization and precise semantic mapping.</p></details> |  |

The parameter usage in semantic SLAM systems increases significantly with the growing complexity of the environment, making it particularly challenging and costly for scene understanding. To address this problem, we introduce a novel hierarchical representation that encodes semantic information in a compact form into 3D Gaussian Splatting, leveraging the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). We further introduce a novel semantic loss designed to optimize hierarchical semantic information through both inter-level and cross-level optimization. Furthermore, we enhance the whole SLAM system, resulting in improved tracking and mapping performance. Our Hi-SLAM outperforms existing dense SLAM methods in both mapping and tracking accuracy, while achieving a 2x operation speed-up. Additionally, it exhibits competitive performance in rendering semantic segmentation in small synthetic scenes, with significantly reduced storage and training time requirements. Rendering FPS impressively reaches 2,000 with semantic information and 3,000 without it. Most notably, it showcases the capability of handling the complex real-world scene with more than 500 semantic classes, highlighting its valuable scaling-up capability.</p></details> | 6 pages, 4 figures |

This paper presents an object-based semantic SLAM method for underwater environments that can identify, localize, classify, and map a wide variety of marine objects without a priori knowledge of the object classes present in the scene. The method performs unsupervised object segmentation and object-level feature aggregation, and then uses opti-acoustic sensor fusion for object localization. Probabilistic data association is used to determine observation to landmark correspondences. Given such correspondences, the method then jointly optimizes landmark and vehicle position estimates. Indoor and outdoor underwater datasets with a wide variety of objects and challenging acoustic and lighting conditions are collected for evaluation and made publicly available. Quantitative and qualitative results show the proposed method achieves reduced trajectory error compared to baseline methods, and is able to obtain comparable map accuracy to a baseline closed-set method that requires hand-labeled data of all objects in the scene.</p></details> | <details><summary>Minor...</summary><p>Minor typo tixes and clarifications</p></details> |

A robot's exploration behavior can be inherently affected by the performance of its Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) subsystem, although SLAM and exploration are generally studied separately. In this paper, we formulate exploration as an active mapping problem and extend it with semantic information. We introduce a novel active metric-semantic SLAM approach, leveraging recent research advances in information theory and spectral graph theory: we combine semantic mutual information and the connectivity metrics of the underlying pose graph of the SLAM subsystem. We use the resulting utility function to evaluate different trajectories to select the most favorable strategy during exploration. Exploration and SLAM metrics are analyzed in experiments. Running our algorithm on the Habitat dataset, we show that, while maintaining efficiency close to the state-of-the-art exploration methods, our approach effectively increases the performance of metric-semantic SLAM with a 21% reduction in average map error and a 9% improvement in average semantic classification accuracy.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

Commonly, 3D semantic reconstruction systems capture the entire scene in the same level of detail. However, certain tasks (e.g., object interaction) require a fine-grained and high-resolution map, particularly if the objects to interact are of small size or intricate geometry. In recent practice, this leads to the entire map being in the same high-quality resolution, which results in increased computational and storage costs. To address this challenge, we propose MAP-ADAPT, a real-time method for quality-adaptive semantic 3D reconstruction using RGBD frames. MAP-ADAPT is the first adaptive semantic 3D mapping algorithm that, unlike prior work, generates directly a single map with regions of different quality based on both the semantic information and the geometric complexity of the scene. Leveraging a semantic SLAM pipeline for pose and semantic estimation, we achieve comparable or superior results to state-of-the-art methods on synthetic and real-world data, while significantly reducing storage and computation requirements.</p></details> |  |

In this system, we incorporate semantic feature embedding into 3D Gaussian representation, which effectively encodes semantic information within the spatial layout of the environment for precise semantic scene representation. Furthermore, we propose feature-level loss for updating 3D Gaussian representation, enabling higher-level guidance for 3D Gaussian optimization. In addition, to reduce cumulative drift in tracking and improve semantic reconstruction accuracy, we introduce semantic-informed bundle adjustment leveraging multi-frame semantic associations for joint optimization of 3D Gaussian representation and camera poses, leading to low-drift tracking and accurate mapping. Our SemGauss-SLAM method demonstrates superior performance over existing radiance field-based SLAM methods in terms of mapping and tracking accuracy on Replica and ScanNet datasets, while also showing excellent capabilities in high-precision semantic segmentation and dense semantic mapping.</p></details> |  |
| **[Khronos: A Unified Approach for Spatio-Temporal Metric-Semantic SLAM in Dynamic Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13817v2)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Perceiving and understanding highly dynamic and changing environments is a crucial capability for robot autonomy. While large strides have been made towards developing dynamic SLAM approaches that estimate the robot pose accurately, a lesser emphasis has been put on the construction of dense spatio-temporal representations of the robot environment. A detailed understanding of the scene and its evolution through time is crucial for long-term robot autonomy and essential to tasks that require long-term reasoning, such as operating effectively in environments shared with humans and other agents and thus are subject to short and long-term dynamics. To address this challenge, this work defines the Spatio-temporal Metric-semantic SLAM (SMS) problem, and presents a framework to factorize and solve it efficiently. We show that the proposed factorization suggests a natural organization of a spatio-temporal perception system, where a fast process tracks short-term dynamics in an active temporal window, while a slower process reasons over long-term changes in the environment using a factor graph formulation. We provide an efficient implementation of the proposed spatio-temporal perception approach, that we call Khronos, and show that it unifies exiting interpretations of short-term and long-term dynamics and is able to construct a dense spatio-temporal map in real-time. We provide simulated and real results, showing that the spatio-temporal maps built by Khronos are an accurate reflection of a 3D scene over time and that Khronos outperforms baselines across multiple metrics. We further validate our approach on two heterogeneous robots in challenging, large-scale real-world environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Robotics: Science and Systems, 2024.

In this system, we introduce hierarchical semantic representation to allow multi-level semantic comprehension for top-down structured semantic mapping of the scene. In addition, to fully utilize the correlation between multiple attributes of the environment, we integrate appearance, geometry and semantic features through cross-attention for feature collaboration. This strategy enables a more multifaceted understanding of the environment, thereby allowing SNI-SLAM to remain robust even when single attribute is defective. Then, we design an internal fusion-based decoder to obtain semantic, RGB, Truncated Signed Distance Field (TSDF) values from multi-level features for accurate decoding. Furthermore, we propose a feature loss to update the scene representation at the feature level. Compared with low-level losses such as RGB loss and depth loss, our feature loss is capable of guiding the network optimization on a higher-level. Our SNI-SLAM method demonstrates superior performance over all recent NeRF-based SLAM methods in terms of mapping and tracking accuracy on Replica and ScanNet datasets, while also showing excellent capabilities in accurate semantic segmentation and real-time semantic mapping.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2024</p></details> |
| **[SD-SLAM: A Semantic SLAM Approach for Dynamic Scenes Based on LiDAR Point Clouds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18318v1)** | 2024-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Point cloud maps generated via LiDAR sensors using extensive remotely sensed data are commonly used by autonomous vehicles and robots for localization and navigation. However, dynamic objects contained in point cloud maps not only downgrade localization accuracy and navigation performance but also jeopardize the map quality. In response to this challenge, we propose in this paper a novel semantic SLAM approach for dynamic scenes based on LiDAR point clouds, referred to as SD-SLAM hereafter. The main contributions of this work are in three aspects: 1) introducing a semantic SLAM framework dedicatedly for dynamic scenes based on LiDAR point clouds, 2) Employing semantics and Kalman filtering to effectively differentiate between dynamic and semi-static landmarks, and 3) Making full use of semi-static and pure static landmarks with semantic information in the SD-SLAM process to improve localization and mapping performance. To evaluate the proposed SD-SLAM, tests were conducted using the widely adopted KITTI odometry dataset. Results demonstrate that the proposed SD-SLAM effectively mitigates the adverse effects of dynamic objects on SLAM, improving vehicle localization and mapping performance in dynamic scenes, and simultaneously constructing a static semantic map with multiple semantic classes for enhanced environment understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[3D Active Metric-Semantic SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06950v3)** | 2024-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this letter, we address the problem of exploration and metric-semantic mapping of multi-floor GPS-denied indoor environments using Size Weight and Power (SWaP) constrained aerial robots. Most previous work in exploration assumes that robot localization is solved. However, neglecting the state uncertainty of the agent can ultimately lead to cascading errors both in the resulting map and in the state of the agent itself. Furthermore, actions that reduce localization errors may be at direct odds with the exploration task. We propose a framework that balances the efficiency of exploration with actions that reduce the state uncertainty of the agent. In particular, our algorithmic approach for active metric-semantic SLAM is built upon sparse information abstracted from raw problem data, to make it suitable for SWaP-constrained robots. Furthermore, we integrate this framework within a fully autonomous aerial robotic system that achieves autonomous exploration in cluttered, 3D environments. From extensive real-world experiments, we showed that by including Semantic Loop Closure (SLC), we can reduce the robot pose estimation errors by over 90% in translation and approximately 75% in yaw, and the uncertainties in pose estimates and semantic maps by over 70% and 65%, respectively. Although discussed in the context of indoor multi-floor exploration, our system can be used for various other applications, such as infrastructure inspection and precision agriculture where reliable GPS data may not be available.</p></details> | Accepted by RA-L |
| **[Preferential Multi-Target Search in Indoor Environments using Semantic SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14063v3)** | 2024-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the demand for service robots capable of executing tasks beyond autonomous navigation has grown. In the future, service robots will be expected to perform complex tasks like 'Set table for dinner'. High-level tasks like these, require, among other capabilities, the ability to retrieve multiple targets. This paper delves into the challenge of locating multiple targets in an environment, termed 'Find my Objects.' We present a novel heuristic designed to facilitate robots in conducting a preferential search for multiple targets in indoor spaces. Our approach involves a Semantic SLAM framework that combines semantic object recognition with geometric data to generate a multi-layered map. We fuse the semantic maps with probabilistic priors for efficient inferencing. Recognizing the challenges introduced by obstacles that might obscure a navigation goal and render standard point-to-point navigation strategies less viable, our methodology offers resilience to such factors. Importantly, our method is adaptable to various object detectors, RGB-D SLAM techniques, and local navigation planners. We demonstrate the 'Find my Objects' task in real-world indoor environments, yielding quantitative results that attest to the effectiveness of our methodology. This strategy can be applied in scenarios where service robots need to locate, grasp, and transport objects, taking into account user preferences.

While achieving impressive performance on small synthetic scenes, these methods often suffer from oversmoothed reconstructions, especially for complex real-world scenes. In this work, we introduce DNS SLAM, a novel neural RGB-D semantic SLAM approach featuring a hybrid representation. Relying only on 2D semantic priors, we propose the first semantic neural SLAM method that trains class-wise scene representations while providing stable camera tracking at the same time. Our method integrates multi-view geometry constraints with image-based feature extraction to improve appearance details and to output color, density, and semantic class information, enabling many downstream applications. To further enable real-time tracking, we introduce a lightweight coarse scene representation which is trained in a self-supervised manner in latent space. Our experimental results achieve state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic data and real-world data tracking while maintaining a commendable operational speed on off-the-shelf hardware. Further, our method outputs class-wise decomposed reconstructions with better texture capturing appearance and geometric details.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Accurate Loop Closure Detection in Semantic SLAM with 3D Semantic Covisibility Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12245v1)** | 2023-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Loop closure is necessary for correcting errors accumulated in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) in unknown environments. However, conventional loop closure methods based on low-level geometric or image features may cause high ambiguity by not distinguishing similar scenarios. Thus, incorrect loop closures can occur. Though semantic 2D image information is considered in some literature to detect loop closures, there is little work that compares 3D scenes as an integral part of a semantic SLAM system. This paper introduces an approach, called SmSLAM+LCD, integrated into a semantic SLAM system to combine high-level 3D semantic information and low-level feature information to conduct accurate loop closure detection and effective drift reduction. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated in testing results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Autonomous Search of Semantic Objects in Unknown Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13236v2)** | 2023-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the problem of enabling a robot to search for a semantic object, i.e., an object with a semantic label, in an unknown and GPS-denied environment. For the robot in the unknown environment to detect and find the target semantic object, it must perform simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) at both geometric and semantic levels using its onboard sensors while planning and executing its motion based on the ever-updated SLAM results. In other words, the robot must be able to conduct simultaneous localization, semantic mapping, motion planning, and execution in real-time in the presence of sensing and motion uncertainty. This is an open problem as it combines semantic SLAM based on perception and real-time motion planning and execution under uncertainty. Moreover, the goals of the robot motion change on the fly depending on whether and how the robot can detect the target object. We propose a novel approach to tackle the problem, leveraging semantic SLAM, Bayesian Networks, Markov Decision Process, and Real-Time Dynamic Programming. The results in simulation and real experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.</p></details> |  |

Recent semantic SLAM systems towards dynamic environments either rely solely on 2D semantic information, or solely on geometric information, or combine their results in a loosely integrated manner. In this research paper, we introduce 3DS-SLAM, 3D Semantic SLAM, tailored for dynamic scenes with visual 3D object detection. The 3DS-SLAM is a tightly-coupled algorithm resolving both semantic and geometric constraints sequentially. We designed a 3D part-aware hybrid transformer for point cloud-based object detection to identify dynamic objects. Subsequently, we propose a dynamic feature filter based on HDBSCAN clustering to extract objects with significant absolute depth differences. When compared against ORB-SLAM2, 3DS-SLAM exhibits an average improvement of 98.01% across the dynamic sequences of the TUM RGB-D dataset. Furthermore, it surpasses the performance of the other four leading SLAM systems designed for dynamic environments.</p></details> |  |

One of the key implicit assumptions when solving cooperative multi-robot problems is that all robots use the same (homogeneous) underlying algorithm. However, in practice, we want to allow collaboration between robots possessing different capabilities and that therefore must rely on heterogeneous algorithms. We present a system architecture and the supporting theory, to enable collaboration in a decentralized network of robots, where each robot relies on different estimation algorithms. To develop our approach, we focus on multi-robot simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) with multi-target tracking. Our theoretical framework builds on our idea of exploiting the conditional independence structure inherent to many robotics applications to separate between each robot's local inference (estimation) tasks and fuse only relevant parts of their non-equal, but overlapping probability density function (pdfs). We present a new decentralized graph-based approach to the multi-robot SLAM and tracking problem. We leverage factor graphs to split between different parts of the problem for efficient data sharing between robots in the network while enabling robots to use different local sparse landmark/dense/metric-semantic SLAM algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures, presented at the ICRA 2023 workshop on "Distributed Graph Algorithms for Robotics"</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose a novel RGBD vSLAM algorithm that can learn a memory-efficient, dense 3D geometry, and semantic segmentation of an indoor scene in an online manner. Our pipeline combines classical 3D vision-based tracking and loop closing with neural fields-based mapping. The mapping network learns the SDF of the scene as well as RGB, depth, and semantic maps of any novel view using only a set of keyframes. Additionally, we extend our pipeline to large scenes by using multiple local mapping networks. Extensive experiments on well-known benchmark datasets confirm that our approach provides robust tracking, mapping, and semantic labeling even with noisy, sparse, or no input depth. Overall, our proposed algorithm can greatly enhance scene perception and assist with a range of robot control problems.</p></details> |  |

Recent SLAM frameworks have been proposed to simultaneously track the camera and moving objects. However they are often unable to estimate the canonical pose of the objects and exhibit a low object tracking accuracy. To solve this problem we propose TwistSLAM++, a semantic, dynamic, SLAM system that fuses stereo images and LiDAR information. Using semantic information, we track potentially moving objects and associate them to 3D object detections in LiDAR scans to obtain their pose and size. Then, we perform registration on consecutive object scans to refine object pose estimation. Finally, object scans are used to estimate the shape of the object and constrain map points to lie on the estimated surface within the BA. We show on classical benchmarks that this fusion approach based on multimodal information improves the accuracy of object tracking.</p></details> |  |

Several SLAM systems with impressive performance have been invented and used during the last several decades. However, there are still unresolved issues, such as how to deal with moving objects in dynamic situations. Classic SLAM systems depend on the assumption of a static environment, which becomes unworkable in highly dynamic situations. Several methods have been presented to tackle this issue in recent years, but each has its limitations. This research combines the visual SLAM systems ORB-SLAM3 and Detectron2 to present the Det-SLAM system, which employs depth information and semantic segmentation to identify and eradicate dynamic spots to accomplish semantic SLAM for dynamic situations. Evaluation of public TUM datasets indicates that Det-SLAM is more resilient than previous dynamic SLAM systems and can lower the estimated error of camera posture in dynamic indoor scenarios.</p></details> | 5 pages, 2 figures |

The objects may be moved by inhabitants, but not completely at random. The robot may be called upon later to retrieve objects and will need a long-term object-based memory in order to know how to find them. Existing work in semantic slam does not attempt to capture the dynamics of object movement. In this paper, we combine some aspects of classic techniques for data-association filtering with modern attention-based neural networks to construct object-based memory systems that operate on high-dimensional observations and hypotheses. We perform end-to-end learning on labeled observation trajectories to learn both the transition and observation models. We demonstrate the system's effectiveness in maintaining memory of dynamically changing objects in both simulated environment and real images, and demonstrate improvements over classical structured approaches as well as unstructured neural approaches.

| **[Hybrid Belief Pruning with Guarantees for Viewpoint-Dependent Semantic SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09103v1)** | 2022-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic simultaneous localization and mapping is a subject of increasing interest in robotics and AI that directly influences the autonomous vehicles industry, the army industries, and more. One of the challenges in this field is to obtain object classification jointly with robot trajectory estimation. Considering view-dependent semantic measurements, there is a coupling between different classes, resulting in a combinatorial number of hypotheses. A common solution is to prune hypotheses that have a sufficiently low probability and to retain only a limited number of hypotheses. However, after pruning and renormalization, the updated probability is overconfident with respect to the original probability. This is especially problematic for systems that require high accuracy. If the prior probability of the classes is independent, the original normalization factor can be computed efficiently without pruning hypotheses. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to present these results. If the prior probability of the classes is dependent, we propose a lower bound on the normalization factor that ensures cautious results. The bound is calculated incrementally and with similar efficiency as in the independent case. After pruning and updating based on the bound, this belief is shown empirically to be close to the original belief.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 12 figures, accepted to IROS</p></details> |
| **[Object Structural Points Representation for Graph-based Semantic Monocular Localization and Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.10263v1)** | 2022-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient object level representation for monocular semantic simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) still lacks a widely accepted solution. In this paper, we propose the use of an efficient representation, based on structural points, for the geometry of objects to be used as landmarks in a monocular semantic SLAM system based on the pose-graph formulation. In particular, an inverse depth parametrization is proposed for the landmark nodes in the pose-graph to store object position, orientation and size/scale. The proposed formulation is general and it can be applied to different geometries; in this paper we focus on indoor environments where human-made artifacts commonly share a planar rectangular shape, e.g., windows, doors, cabinets, etc. The approach can be easily extended to urban scenarios where similar shapes exists as well. Experiments in simulation show good performance, particularly in object geometry reconstruction.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to IROS 2015 (rejected)</p></details> |

Recently, however, the community has realized that progress towards robust intelligent systems such as self-driving cars requires a concerted effort across the different fields. This motivated us to develop KITTI-360, successor of the popular KITTI dataset. KITTI-360 is a suburban driving dataset which comprises richer input modalities, comprehensive semantic instance annotations and accurate localization to facilitate research at the intersection of vision, graphics and robotics. For efficient annotation, we created a tool to label 3D scenes with bounding primitives and developed a model that transfers this information into the 2D image domain, resulting in over 150k images and 1B 3D points with coherent semantic instance annotations across 2D and 3D. Moreover, we established benchmarks and baselines for several tasks relevant to mobile perception, encompassing problems from computer vision, graphics, and robotics on the same dataset, e.g., semantic scene understanding, novel view synthesis and semantic SLAM. KITTI-360 will enable progress at the intersection of these research areas and thus contribute towards solving one of today's grand challenges: the development of fully autonomous self-driving systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1511.03240</p></details> |
| **[Multi-modal Semantic SLAM for Complex Dynamic Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04300v2)** | 2022-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is one of the most essential techniques in many real-world robotic applications. The assumption of static environments is common in most SLAM algorithms, which however, is not the case for most applications. Recent work on semantic SLAM aims to understand the objects in an environment and distinguish dynamic information from a scene context by performing image-based segmentation. However, the segmentation results are often imperfect or incomplete, which can subsequently reduce the quality of mapping and the accuracy of localization. In this paper, we present a robust multi-modal semantic framework to solve the SLAM problem in complex and highly dynamic environments. We propose to learn a more powerful object feature representation and deploy the mechanism of looking and thinking twice to the backbone network, which leads to a better recognition result to our baseline instance segmentation model. Moreover, both geometric-only clustering and visual semantic information are combined to reduce the effect of segmentation error due to small-scale objects, occlusion and motion blur. Thorough experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The results show that our method can precisely identify dynamic objects under recognition imperfection and motion blur. Moreover, the proposed SLAM framework is able to efficiently build a static dense map at a processing rate of more than 10 Hz, which can be implemented in many practical applications. Both training data and the proposed method is open sourced at https://github.com/wh200720041/MMS_SLAM.</p></details> |  |
| **[RGB-D Semantic SLAM for Surgical Robot Navigation in the Operating Room](http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.05467v1)** | 2022-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gaining spatial awareness of the Operating Room (OR) for surgical robotic systems is a key technology that can enable intelligent applications aiming at improved OR workflow. In this work, we present a method for semantic dense reconstruction of the OR scene using multiple RGB-D cameras attached and registered to the da Vinci Xi surgical system. We developed a novel SLAM approach for robot pose tracking in dynamic OR environments and dense reconstruction of the static OR table object. We validated our techniques in a mock OR by collecting data sequences with corresponding optical tracking trajectories as ground truth and manually annotated 100 frame segmentation masks. The mean absolute trajectory error is $11.4\pm1.9$ mm and the mean relative pose error is $1.53\pm0.48$ degrees per second. The segmentation DICE score is improved from 0.814 to 0.902 by using our SLAM system compared to single frame. Our approach effectively produces a dense OR table reconstruction in dynamic clinical environments as well as improved semantic segmentation on individual image frames.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probabilistic Data Association for Semantic SLAM at Scale](http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.12802v1)** | 2022-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With advances in image processing and machine learning, it is now feasible to incorporate semantic information into the problem of simultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM). Previously, SLAM was carried out using lower level geometric features (points, lines, and planes) which are often view-point dependent and error prone in visually repetitive environments. Semantic information can improve the ability to recognise previously visited locations, as well as maintain sparser maps for long term SLAM applications. However, SLAM in repetitive environments has the critical problem of assigning measurements to the landmarks which generated them. In this paper, we use k-best assignment enumeration to compute marginal assignment probabilities for each measurement landmark pair, in real time. We present numerical studies on the KITTI dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness and speed of the proposed framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 Pag...</summary><p>6 Pages, 3 figures, submitted to Robotics and Automation Letters and the IROS 2020 conference</p></details> |
| **[Perception-Based Temporal Logic Planning in Uncertain Semantic Maps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.10490v3)** | 2022-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses a multi-robot planning problem in environments with partially unknown semantics. The environment is assumed to have known geometric structure (e.g., walls) and to be occupied by static labeled landmarks with uncertain positions and classes. This modeling approach gives rise to an uncertain semantic map generated by semantic SLAM algorithms. Our goal is to design control policies for robots equipped with noisy perception systems so that they can accomplish collaborative tasks captured by global temporal logic specifications. To specify missions that account for environmental and perceptual uncertainty, we employ a fragment of Linear Temporal Logic (LTL), called co-safe LTL, defined over perception-based atomic predicates modeling probabilistic satisfaction requirements. The perception-based LTL planning problem gives rise to an optimal control problem, solved by a novel sampling-based algorithm, that generates open-loop control policies that are updated online to adapt to a continuously learned semantic map. We provide extensive experiments to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed planning architecture.</p></details> |  |
| **[Accurate Object Association and Pose Updating for Semantic SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.11368v3)** | 2021-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current pandemic has caused the medical system to operate under high load. To relieve it, robots with high autonomy can be used to effectively execute contactless operations in hospitals and reduce cross-infection between medical staff and patients. Although semantic Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) technology can improve the autonomy of robots, semantic object association is still a problem that is worthy of being studied. The key to solving this problem is to correctly associate multiple object measurements of one object landmark by using semantic information, and to refine the pose of object landmark in real time. To this end, we propose a hierarchical object association strategy and a pose-refinement approach. The former one consists of two levels, i.e., a short-term object association and a global one. In the first level, we employ the multiple-object-tracking for short-term object association, through which the incorrect association among objects whose locations are close and appearances are similar can be avoided. Moreover, the short-term object association can provide more abundant object appearance and more robust estimation of object pose for the global object association in the second level. To refine the object pose in the map, we develop an approach to choose the optimal object pose from all object measurements associated with an object landmark. The proposed method is comprehensively evaluated on seven simulated hospital sequences1, a real hospital environment and the KITTI dataset. Experimental results show that our method has an obviously improvement in terms of robustness and accuracy for the object association and the trajectory estimation in the semantic SLAM.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

Kimera-Multi is implemented by a team of robots equipped with visual-inertial sensors. Each robot builds a local trajectory estimate and a local mesh using Kimera. When communication is available, robots initiate a distributed place recognition and robust pose graph optimization protocol based on a novel distributed graduated non-convexity algorithm. The proposed protocol allows the robots to improve their local trajectory estimates by leveraging inter-robot loop closures while being robust to outliers. Finally, each robot uses its improved trajectory estimate to correct the local mesh using mesh deformation techniques. We demonstrate Kimera-Multi in photo-realistic simulations, SLAM benchmarking datasets, and challenging outdoor datasets collected using ground robots. Both real and simulated experiments involve long trajectories (e.g., up to 800 meters per robot). The experiments show that Kimera-Multi (i) outperforms the state of the art in terms of robustness and accuracy, (ii) achieves estimation errors comparable to a centralized SLAM system while being fully distributed, (iii) is parsimonious in terms of communication bandwidth, (iv) produces accurate metric-semantic 3D meshes, and (v) is modular and can be also used for standard 3D reconstruction (i.e., without semantic labels) or for trajectory estimation (i.e., without reconstructing a 3D mesh).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Robotics (18 pages, 15 figures)</p></details> |
| **[Superquadric Object Representation for Optimization-based Semantic SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.09627v1)** | 2021-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Introducing semantically meaningful objects to visual Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) has the potential to improve both the accuracy and reliability of pose estimates, especially in challenging scenarios with significant view-point and appearance changes. However, how semantic objects should be represented for an efficient inclusion in optimization-based SLAM frameworks is still an open question. Superquadrics(SQs) are an efficient and compact object representation, able to represent most common object types to a high degree, and typically retrieved from 3D point-cloud data. However, accurate 3D point-cloud data might not be available in all applications. Recent advancements in machine learning enabled robust object recognition and semantic mask measurements from camera images under many different appearance conditions. We propose a pipeline to leverage such semantic mask measurements to fit SQ parameters to multi-view camera observations using a multi-stage initialization and optimization procedure. We demonstrate the system's ability to retrieve randomly generated SQ parameters from multi-view mask observations in preliminary simulation experiments and evaluate different initialization stages and cost functions.</p></details> |  |

In this paper we evaluate the quality of semantic maps generated by state-of-the-art class- and instance-aware dense semantic SLAM algorithms whose codes are publicly available and explore the impacts both semantic segmentation and pose estimation have on the quality of semantic maps. We obtain these results by providing algorithms with ground-truth pose and/or semantic segmentation data available from simulated environments. We establish that semantic segmentation is the largest source of error through our experiments, dropping mAP and OMQ performance by up to 74.3% and 71.3% respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted to IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) 2021</p></details> |

The goal is to detect corn stalks and localize them in a global coordinate frame. This is a challenging setup for existing algorithms because there is very little space between the camera and the plants, and the camera motion is primarily restricted to be along the row. To overcome these challenges, we present a multi-camera system where a side camera (facing the plants) is used for detection whereas front and back cameras are used for motion estimation. Next, we show how semantic features in the environment (corn stalks, ground, and crop planes) can be used to develop a robust semantic SLAM solution and present results from field trials performed throughout the growing season across various cornfields.</p></details> | 7 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Epistemic Uncertainty Aware Semantic Localization and Mapping for Inference and Belief Space Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.12359v1)** | 2021-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the problem of autonomous object classification and semantic SLAM, which in general exhibits a tight coupling between classification, metric SLAM and planning under uncertainty. We contribute a unified framework for inference and belief space planning (BSP) that addresses prominent sources of uncertainty in this context: classification aliasing (classier cannot distinguish between candidate classes from certain viewpoints), classifier epistemic uncertainty (classifier receives data "far" from its training set), and localization uncertainty (camera and object poses are uncertain). Specifically, we develop two methods for maintaining a joint distribution over robot and object poses, and over posterior class probability vector that considers epistemic uncertainty in a Bayesian fashion. The first approach is Multi-Hybrid (MH), where multiple hybrid beliefs over poses and classes are maintained to approximate the joint belief over poses and posterior class probability. The second approach is Joint Lambda Pose (JLP), where the joint belief is maintained directly using a novel JLP factor. Furthermore, we extend both methods to BSP, planning while reasoning about future posterior epistemic uncertainty indirectly, or directly via a novel information-theoretic reward function. Both inference methods utilize a novel viewpoint-dependent classifier uncertainty model that leverages the coupling between poses and classification scores and predicts the epistemic uncertainty from certain viewpoints. In addition, this model is used to generate predicted measurements during planning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that reasons about classifier epistemic uncertainty within semantic SLAM and BSP.</p></details> | <details><summary>44 pa...</summary><p>44 pages, 38 figures, submitted to Autonomous Robots Journal (ARJ)</p></details> |
| **[SuMa++: Efficient LiDAR-based Semantic SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.11320v1)** | 2021-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reliable and accurate localization and mapping are key components of most autonomous systems. Besides geometric information about the mapped environment, the semantics plays an important role to enable intelligent navigation behaviors. In most realistic environments, this task is particularly complicated due to dynamics caused by moving objects, which can corrupt the mapping step or derail localization. In this paper, we propose an extension of a recently published surfel-based mapping approach exploiting three-dimensional laser range scans by integrating semantic information to facilitate the mapping process. The semantic information is efficiently extracted by a fully convolutional neural network and rendered on a spherical projection of the laser range data. This computed semantic segmentation results in point-wise labels for the whole scan, allowing us to build a semantically-enriched map with labeled surfels. This semantic map enables us to reliably filter moving objects, but also improve the projective scan matching via semantic constraints. Our experimental evaluation on challenging highways sequences from KITTI dataset with very few static structures and a large amount of moving cars shows the advantage of our semantic SLAM approach in comparison to a purely geometric, state-of-the-art approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IROS 2019.

| **[Multiple Hypothesis Semantic Mapping for Robust Data Association](http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.04423v1)** | 2020-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present a semantic mapping approach with multiple hypothesis tracking for data association. As semantic information has the potential to overcome ambiguity in measurements and place recognition, it forms an eminent modality for autonomous systems. This is particularly evident in urban scenarios with several similar looking surroundings. Nevertheless, it requires the handling of a non-Gaussian and discrete random variable coming from object detectors. Previous methods facilitate semantic information for global localization and data association to reduce the instance ambiguity between the landmarks. However, many of these approaches do not deal with the creation of complete globally consistent representations of the environment and typically do not scale well. We utilize multiple hypothesis trees to derive a probabilistic data association for semantic measurements by means of position, instance and class to create a semantic representation. We propose an optimized mapping method and make use of a pose graph to derive a novel semantic SLAM solution. Furthermore, we show that semantic covisibility graphs allow for a precise place recognition in urban environments. We verify our approach using real-world outdoor dataset and demonstrate an average drift reduction of 33 % w.r.t. the raw odometry source. Moreover, our approach produces 55 % less hypotheses on average than a regular multiple hypotheses approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semantic SLAM with Autonomous Object-Level Data Association](http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.10625v1)** | 2020-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is often desirable to capture and map semantic information of an environment during simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Such semantic information can enable a robot to better distinguish places with similar low-level geometric and visual features and perform high-level tasks that use semantic information about objects to be manipulated and environments to be navigated. While semantic SLAM has gained increasing attention, there is little research on semanticlevel data association based on semantic objects, i.e., object-level data association. In this paper, we propose a novel object-level data association algorithm based on bag of words algorithm, formulated as a maximum weighted bipartite matching problem. With object-level data association solved, we develop a quadratic-programming-based semantic object initialization scheme using dual quadric and introduce additional constraints to improve the success rate of object initialization. The integrated semantic-level SLAM system can achieve high-accuracy object-level data association and real-time semantic mapping as demonstrated in the experiments. The online semantic map building and semantic-level localization capabilities facilitate semantic-level mapping and task planning in a priori unknown environment.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose an ensemble data associate strategy for integrating the parametric and nonparametric statistic tests. By exploiting the nature of different statistics, our method can effectively aggregate the information of different measurements, and thus significantly improve the robustness and accuracy of data association. We then present an accurate object pose estimation framework, in which an outliers-robust centroid and scale estimation algorithm and an object pose initialization algorithm are developed to help improve the optimality of pose estimation results. Furthermore, we build a SLAM system that can generate semi-dense or lightweight object-oriented maps with a monocular camera. Extensive experiments are conducted on three publicly available datasets and a real scenario.

The library goes beyond existing visual and visual-inertial SLAM libraries (e.g., ORB-SLAM, VINS- Mono, OKVIS, ROVIO) by enabling mesh reconstruction and semantic labeling in 3D. Kimera is designed with modularity in mind and has four key components: a visual-inertial odometry (VIO) module for fast and accurate state estimation, a robust pose graph optimizer for global trajectory estimation, a lightweight 3D mesher module for fast mesh reconstruction, and a dense 3D metric-semantic reconstruction module. The modules can be run in isolation or in combination, hence Kimera can easily fall back to a state-of-the-art VIO or a full SLAM system. Kimera runs in real-time on a CPU and produces a 3D metric-semantic mesh from semantically labeled images, which can be obtained by modern deep learning methods. We hope that the flexibility, computational efficiency, robustness, and accuracy afforded by Kimera will build a solid basis for future metric-semantic SLAM and perception research, and will allow researchers across multiple areas (e.g., VIO, SLAM, 3D reconstruction, segmentation) to benchmark and prototype their own efforts without having to start from scratch.</p></details> | 8 pages |

Traditional SLAM approaches rely heavily on low-level geometric constraints like corners or lines, which may lead to tracking failure in textureless surroundings or cluttered world with dynamic objects. In this paper, a compact semantic SLAM framework is proposed, with utilization of both geometric and object-level semantic constraints jointly, a more consistent mapping result, and more accurate pose estimation can be obtained. Two main contributions are presented int the paper, a) a robust and efficient SLAM data association and optimization framework is proposed, it models both discrete semantic labeling and continuous pose. b) a compact map representation, combining 2D Lidar map with object detection is presented. Experiments on public indoor datasets, TUM-RGBD, ICL-NUIM, and our own collected datasets prove the improving of SLAM robustness and accuracy compared to other popular SLAM systems, meanwhile a map maintenance efficiency can be achieved.</p></details> | 8 pages, 11 figures |

We aim to develop robots that can use all of these sources of information for reliable navigation, but each is corrupted by noise. Rather than assume that object detection will eventually achieve near perfect performance across the lifetime of a robot, in this work we represent and cope with the semantic and geometric uncertainty inherent in methods like object detection. Specifically, we model data association ambiguity, which is typically non-Gaussian, in a way that is amenable to solution within the common nonlinear Gaussian formulation of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). We do so by eliminating data association variables from the inference process through max-marginalization, preserving standard Gaussian posterior assumptions. The result is a max-mixture-type model that accounts for multiple data association hypotheses as well as incorrect loop closures. We provide experimental results on indoor and outdoor semantic navigation tasks with noisy odometry and object detection and find that the ability of the proposed approach to represent multiple hypotheses, including the "null" hypothesis, gives substantial robustness advantages in comparison to alternative semantic SLAM approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Autho...</summary><p>Authors D.

The proposed framework is assessed through simulation using ROS-based Gazebo-simulated mobile robot, RGB-D camera (3D sensor) and a laser range finder (2D sensor) in 3D model of realistic indoor environment.

While sparse point-based SLAM methods provide accurate camera localization, the generated maps lack semantic information. On the other hand, state of the art object detection methods provide rich information about entities present in the scene from a single image. This work incorporates a real-time deep-learned object detector to the monocular SLAM framework for representing generic objects as quadrics that permit detections to be seamlessly integrated while allowing the real-time performance. Finer reconstruction of an object, learned by a CNN network, is also incorporated and provides a shape prior for the quadric leading further refinement. To capture the dominant structure of the scene, additional planar landmarks are detected by a CNN-based plane detector and modeled as independent landmarks in the map. Extensive experiments support our proposed inclusion of semantic objects and planar structures directly in the bundle-adjustment of SLAM - Semantic SLAM - that enriches the reconstructed map semantically, while significantly improving the camera localization.

When ambiguous measurements arise, conservatism often mandates that the measurement is discarded or a new landmark is initialized rather than risking an incorrect association. To address the inevitable `duplicate' landmarks that arise, we present an efficient map-merging framework to detect duplicate constellations of landmarks, providing a high-confidence loop-closure mechanism well-suited for object-level SLAM. This approach uses an incrementally-computable approximation of landmark uncertainty that only depends on local information in the SLAM graph, avoiding expensive recovery of the full system covariance matrix. This enables a search based on geometric consistency (GC) (rather than full joint compatibility (JC)) that inexpensively reduces the search space to a handful of `best' hypotheses. Furthermore, we reformulate the commonly-used interpretation tree to allow for more efficient integration of clique-based pairwise compatibility, accelerating the branch-and-bound max-cardinality search. Our method is demonstrated to match the performance of full JC methods at significantly-reduced computational cost, facilitating robust object-based loop-closure over large SLAM problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) 2019</p></details> |

Recent studies on object detection and feature extraction have become important for scene understanding and 3D mapping. However, 3D shape of the object is too complex to formulate the probabilistic observation model; therefore, performing the Bayesian inference of the object-oriented features as well as their pose is less considered. Besides, when the robot equipped with an RGB mono camera only observes the projected single view of an object, a significant amount of the 3D shape information is abandoned. Due to these limitations, semantic SLAM and viewpoint-independent loop closure using volumetric 3D object shape is challenging. In order to enable the complete formulation of probabilistic semantic SLAM, we approximate the observation model of a 3D object with a tractable distribution. We also estimate the variational likelihood from the 2D image of the object to exploit its observed single view. In order to evaluate the proposed method, we perform pose and feature estimation, and demonstrate that the automatic loop closure works seamlessly without additional loop detector in various environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>will ...</summary><p>will be submitted to ICRA 2018</p></details> |

Recent approaches to object recognition methods become important for semantic simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). However, there is a lack of consideration of the probabilistic observation model for 3D objects, as the shape of a 3D object basically follows a complex probability distribution. Furthermore, since the mobile robot equipped with a range sensor observes only a single view, much information of the object shape is discarded. These limitations are the major obstacles to semantic SLAM and view-independent loop closure using 3D object shapes as features. In order to enable the numerical analysis for the Bayesian inference, we approximate the true observation model of 3D objects to tractable distributions. Since the observation likelihood can be obtained from the generative model, we formulate the true generative model for 3D object with the Bayesian networks. To capture these complex distributions, we apply a variational auto-encoder. To analyze the approximated distributions and encoded features, we perform classification with maximum likelihood estimation and shape retrieval.</p></details> | <details><summary>to ap...</summary><p>to appear in the proceedings of IROS 2018</p></details> |

This is especially important in ego-centric tasks where obtaining 3 dimensional information is both limiting and challenging with the current 2D video analysis methods proving insufficient. Here we demonstrate a proof-of-concept system which provides real-time 3D mapping and semantic labeling of the local environment from an ego-centric RGB-D video-stream with 3D gaze point estimation from head mounted eye tracking glasses. We augment existing work in Semantic Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (Semantic SLAM) with collected gaze vectors. Our system can then find and track objects both inside and outside the user field-of-view in 3D from multiple perspectives with reasonable accuracy. We validate our concept by producing a semantic map from images of the NYUv2 dataset while simultaneously estimating gaze position and gaze classes from recorded gaze data of the dataset images.</p></details> |  |

The framework comprises four main components: VIO Front End, 2D Gaussian Map, NVS Loop Closure, and Dynamic Eraser. In the VIO Front End, RGB frames are processed through dense bundle adjustment and uncertainty estimation to extract scene geometry and poses. Based on this output, the mapping module incrementally constructs and maintains a 2D Gaussian map. Key components of the 2D Gaussian Map include a Sample-based Rasterizer, Score Manager, and Pose Refinement, which collectively improve mapping speed and localization accuracy. This enables the SLAM system to handle large-scale urban environments with up to 50 million Gaussian ellipsoids. To ensure global consistency in large-scale scenes, we design a Loop Closure module, which innovatively leverages the Novel View Synthesis (NVS) capabilities of Gaussian Splatting for loop closure detection and correction of the Gaussian map. Additionally, we propose a Dynamic Eraser to address the inevitable presence of dynamic objects in real-world outdoor scenes. Extensive evaluations in indoor and outdoor environments demonstrate that our approach achieves localization performance on par with Visual-Inertial Odometry while surpassing recent GS/NeRF SLAM methods. It also significantly outperforms all existing methods in terms of mapping and rendering quality. Furthermore, we developed a mobile app and verified that our framework can generate high-quality Gaussian maps in real time using only a smartphone camera and a low-frequency IMU sensor. To the best of our knowledge, VINGS-Mono is the first monocular Gaussian SLAM method capable of operating in outdoor environments and supporting kilometer-scale large scenes.</p></details> |  |

However, existing Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) methods generally focus on either geometric or semantic reconstruction. In this paper, we introduce PanoSLAM, the first SLAM system to integrate geometric reconstruction, 3D semantic segmentation, and 3D instance segmentation within a unified framework. Our approach builds upon 3D Gaussian Splatting, modified with several critical components to enable efficient rendering of depth, color, semantic, and instance information from arbitrary viewpoints. To achieve panoptic 3D scene reconstruction from sequential RGB-D videos, we propose an online Spatial-Temporal Lifting (STL) module that transfers 2D panoptic predictions from vision models into 3D Gaussian representations. This STL module addresses the challenges of label noise and inconsistencies in 2D predictions by refining the pseudo labels across multi-view inputs, creating a coherent 3D representation that enhances segmentation accuracy. Our experiments show that PanoSLAM outperforms recent semantic SLAM methods in both mapping and tracking accuracy. For the first time, it achieves panoptic 3D reconstruction of open-world environments directly from the RGB-D video. (https://github.com/runnanchen/PanoSLAM)</p></details> |  |

Existing Neural SLAM or 3DGS-based SLAM methods often trade off between rendering quality and geometry accuracy, our research demonstrates that both can be achieved simultaneously with RGB input alone. The key idea of our approach is to enhance the ability for geometry estimation by combining easy-to-obtain monocular priors with learning-based dense SLAM, and then using 3D Gaussian splatting as our core map representation to efficiently model the scene. Upon loop closure, our method ensures on-the-fly global consistency through efficient pose graph bundle adjustment and instant map updates by explicitly deforming the 3D Gaussian units based on anchored keyframe updates. Furthermore, we introduce a grid-based scale alignment strategy to maintain improved scale consistency in prior depths for finer depth details. Through extensive experiments on Replica, ScanNet, and ScanNet++, we demonstrate significant improvements over existing Neural SLAM methods and even surpass RGB-D-based methods in both reconstruction and rendering quality.

Pose-free scene reconstruction from incomplete, unposed observations is usually regularized with depth estimation or 3D foundational priors. While recent advances have enabled sparse-view reconstruction of unbounded scenes with known camera poses using diffusion priors, these methods rely on explicit camera embeddings for extrapolating unobserved regions. This reliance limits their application in pose-free settings, where view-specific data is only implicitly available. To address this, we propose an instruction-following RGBD diffusion model designed to inpaint missing details and remove artifacts in novel view renders and depth maps of a 3D scene. We also propose a novel confidence measure for Gaussian representations to allow for better detection of these artifacts. By progressively integrating these novel views in a Gaussian-SLAM-inspired process, we achieve a multi-view-consistent Gaussian representation. Evaluations on the MipNeRF360 dataset demonstrate that our method surpasses existing pose-free techniques and performs competitively with state-of-the-art posed reconstruction methods in complex $360^{\circ}$ scenes.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Our primary contribution is in the pipeline itself, particularly in the mapping thread. Given a set of posed RGB-D frames, we detect and track 3D segments, which we describe using CLIP vectors, calculated through a novel aggregation from the viewpoints where these 3D segments are observed. Notably, our OVO-SLAM pipeline is not only faster but also achieves better segmentation metrics compared to offline approaches in the literature. Along with superior segmentation performance, we show experimental results of our contributions integrated with Gaussian-SLAM, being the first ones demonstrating end-to-end open-vocabulary online 3D reconstructions without relying on ground-truth camera poses or scene geometry.</p></details> |  |

However, current methods either lack dense depth maps to supervise the mapping process or detailed training designs that consider the scale of the environment. To address these drawbacks, we present IG-SLAM, a dense RGB-only SLAM system that employs robust Dense-SLAM methods for tracking and combines them with Gaussian Splatting. A 3D map of the environment is constructed using accurate pose and dense depth provided by tracking. Additionally, we utilize depth uncertainty in map optimization to improve 3D reconstruction. Our decay strategy in map optimization enhances convergence and allows the system to run at 10 fps in a single process. We demonstrate competitive performance with state-of-the-art RGB-only SLAM systems while achieving faster operation speeds.

However, these systems often encounter incomplete reconstructions in complex indoor environments, characterized by substantial holes due to unobserved geometry caused by obstacles or limited view angles. To address this challenge, we present Manhattan Gaussian SLAM (MG-SLAM), an RGB-D system that leverages the Manhattan World hypothesis to enhance geometric accuracy and completeness. By seamlessly integrating fused line segments derived from structured scenes, MG-SLAM ensures robust tracking in textureless indoor areas. Moreover, The extracted lines and planar surface assumption allow strategic interpolation of new Gaussians in regions of missing geometry, enabling efficient scene completion. Extensive experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world scenes demonstrate that these advancements enable our method to achieve state-of-the-art performance, marking a substantial improvement in the capabilities of Gaussian SLAM systems.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods have achieved encouraging results on RGB-D SLAM, but studies of the monocular case are still scarce. Moreover, they also fail to correct drift errors due to the lack of loop closure and global optimization. In this paper, we present MG-SLAM, a monocular Gaussian SLAM with a language-extended loop closure module capable of performing drift-corrected tracking and high-fidelity reconstruction while achieving a high-level understanding of the environment. Our key idea is to represent the global map as 3D Gaussian and use it to guide the estimation of the scene geometry, thus mitigating the efforts of missing depth information. Further, an additional language-extended loop closure module which is based on CLIP feature is designed to continually perform global optimization to correct drift errors accumulated as the system runs. Our system shows promising results on multiple challenging datasets in both tracking and mapping and even surpasses some existing RGB-D methods.</p></details> |  |

The system features a compact Gaussian representation and a highly efficient on-the-fly Gaussian optimization scheme. We force each Gaussian to be either opaque or nearly transparent, with the opaque ones fitting the surface and dominant colors, and transparent ones fitting residual colors. By rendering depth in a different way from color rendering, we let a single opaque Gaussian well fit a local surface region without the need of multiple overlapping Gaussians, hence largely reducing the memory and computation cost. For on-the-fly Gaussian optimization, we explicitly add Gaussians for three types of pixels per frame: newly observed, with large color errors, and with large depth errors. We also categorize all Gaussians into stable and unstable ones, where the stable Gaussians are expected to well fit previously observed RGBD images and otherwise unstable. We only optimize the unstable Gaussians and only render the pixels occupied by unstable Gaussians. In this way, both the number of Gaussians to be optimized and pixels to be rendered are largely reduced, and the optimization can be done in real time. We show real-time reconstructions of a variety of large scenes. Compared with the state-of-the-art NeRF-based RGBD SLAM, our system achieves comparable high-quality reconstruction but with around twice the speed and half the memory cost, and shows superior performance in the realism of novel view synthesis and camera tracking accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in ACM SIGGRAPH 2024</p></details> |

However, real-time full posterior inference techniques, such as Gaussian approximation and particle filters, either lack expressiveness for representing non-Gaussian posteriors or suffer from performance degeneracy when estimating high-dimensional posteriors. Inspired by the complementary strengths of Gaussian approximation and particle filters$\unicode{x2013}$scalability and non-Gaussian estimation, respectively$\unicode{x2013}$we blend these two approaches to infer marginal posteriors in SLAM. Specifically, Gaussian approximation provides robot pose distributions on which particle filters are conditioned to sample landmark marginals. In return, the maximum a posteriori point among these samples can be used to reset linearization points in the nonlinear optimization solver of the Gaussian approximation, facilitating the pursuit of global optima. We demonstrate the scalability, generalizability, and accuracy of our algorithm for real-time full posterior inference on realworld range-only SLAM and object-based bearing-only SLAM datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures.

Performing such inference is a key step in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Although the Gaussian approximation often works well, in other more challenging SLAM situations, the posterior distribution is non-Gaussian and cannot be explicitly represented with standard distributions. Our technique applies to settings where the posterior distribution is substantially non-Gaussian (e.g., multi-modal) and thus needs a more expressive representation. NSFG exploits nested sampling methods to directly sample the posterior to represent the distribution without parametric density models. While nested sampling methods are known for their powerful capability in sampling multi-modal distributions, the application of the methods to SLAM factor graphs is not straightforward. NSFG leverages the structure of factor graphs to construct informative prior distributions which are efficiently sampled and provide notable computational benefits for nested sampling methods. We present simulated experiments which demonstrate that NSFG is more robust and computes solutions over an order of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art sampling techniques. Similarly, we compare NSFG to state-of-the-art Gaussian and non-Gaussian SLAM approaches and demonstrate that NSFG is notably more robust in describing non-Gaussian posteriors.</p></details> |  |

LiDAR perception in autonomous driving is impacted by both of these concerns, leading to the emergence of various approaches. This work addresses the challenge by proposing a geometry-based approach, leveraging the sequential structure of LiDAR sensors, which sets it apart from the learning-based methods commonly found in the literature. The proposed method, called 3DLabelProp, is applied on the task of LiDAR Semantic Segmentation (LSS).

The main contributions of this work are: (1) demonstrating that a deep learning model, trained on a mix of real and synthetic images, can accurately predict camera and lens parameters from a single image, and (2) developing a comprehensive synthetic dataset using the AILiveSim simulation platform. This dataset includes variations in focal length and lens distortion parameters, providing a robust foundation for model training and testing. The training process predominantly relied on these synthetic images, complemented by a small subset of real images, to explore how well models trained on synthetic data can perform calibration tasks on real-world images. Traditional calibration methods require multiple images of a calibration object from various orientations, which is often not feasible due to the lack of such images in publicly available datasets. A deep learning network based on the ResNet architecture was trained on this synthetic dataset to predict camera calibration parameters following the Brown-Conrady lens model. The ResNet architecture, adapted for regression tasks, is capable of predicting continuous values essential for accurate camera calibration in applications such as autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality.

Rigorous testing is essential before deployment, with simulation testing playing a key role. However, ADSs are typically complex, consisting of multiple modules such as perception and planning, or well-trained end-to-end autonomous driving systems. Offline methods, such as the Genetic Algorithm (GA), can only generate predefined trajectories for dynamics, which struggle to cause safety violations for ADSs rapidly and efficiently in different scenarios due to their evolutionary nature. Online methods, such as single-agent reinforcement learning (RL), can quickly adjust the dynamics' trajectory online to adapt to different scenarios, but they struggle to capture complex corner cases of ADS arising from the intricate interplay among multiple vehicles. Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has a strong ability in cooperative tasks. On the other hand, it faces its own challenges, particularly with convergence. This paper introduces MARL-OT, a scalable framework that leverages MARL to detect safety violations of ADS resulting from surrounding vehicles' cooperation. MARL-OT employs MARL for high-level guidance, triggering various dangerous scenarios for the rule-based online fuzzer to explore potential safety violations of ADS, thereby generating dynamic, realistic safety violation scenarios. Our approach improves the detected safety violation rate by up to 136.2% compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) testing technique.</p></details> |  |

To address this limitation, in this work, we explore the integration of generative artificial intelligence techniques with physics-based simulators to enhance ADS system-level testing. Our study evaluates the effectiveness and computational overhead of three generative strategies based on diffusion models, namely instruction-editing, inpainting, and inpainting with refinement. Specifically, we assess these techniques' capabilities to produce augmented simulator-generated images of driving scenarios representing new ODDs. We employ a novel automated detector for invalid inputs based on semantic segmentation to ensure semantic preservation and realism of the neural generated images. We then perform system-level testing to evaluate the ADS's generalization ability to newly synthesized ODDs. Our findings show that diffusion models help increase the ODD coverage for system-level testing of ADS. Our automated semantic validator achieved a percentage of false positives as low as 3%, retaining the correctness and quality of the generated images for testing. Our approach successfully identified new ADS system failures before real-world testing.</p></details> |  |

High-quality datasets are crucial for the development of effective data-driven autonomous driving solutions. Next-generation autonomous driving datasets must be multimodal, incorporating data from advanced sensors that feature extensive data coverage, detailed annotations, and diverse scene representation. To address this need, we present OmniHD-Scenes, a large-scale multimodal dataset that provides comprehensive omnidirectional high-definition data. The OmniHD-Scenes dataset combines data from 128-beam LiDAR, six cameras, and six 4D imaging radar systems to achieve full environmental perception. The dataset comprises 1501 clips, each approximately 30-s long, totaling more than 450K synchronized frames and more than 5.85 million synchronized sensor data points. We also propose a novel 4D annotation pipeline. To date, we have annotated 200 clips with more than 514K precise 3D bounding boxes. These clips also include semantic segmentation annotations for static scene elements. Additionally, we introduce a novel automated pipeline for generation of the dense occupancy ground truth, which effectively leverages information from non-key frames. Alongside the proposed dataset, we establish comprehensive evaluation metrics, baseline models, and benchmarks for 3D detection and semantic occupancy prediction. These benchmarks utilize surround-view cameras and 4D imaging radar to explore cost-effective sensor solutions for autonomous driving applications.

| **[Black-Box Adversarial Attack on Vision Language Models for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13563v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) have significantly advanced autonomous driving (AD) by enhancing reasoning capabilities; however, these models remain highly susceptible to adversarial attacks. While existing research has explored white-box attacks to some extent, the more practical and challenging black-box scenarios remain largely underexplored due to their inherent difficulty. In this paper, we take the first step toward designing black-box adversarial attacks specifically targeting VLMs in AD. We identify two key challenges for achieving effective black-box attacks in this context: the effectiveness across driving reasoning chains in AD systems and the dynamic nature of driving scenarios. To address this, we propose Cascading Adversarial Disruption (CAD). It first introduces Decision Chain Disruption, which targets low-level reasoning breakdown by generating and injecting deceptive semantics, ensuring the perturbations remain effective across the entire decision-making chain. Building on this, we present Risky Scene Induction, which addresses dynamic adaptation by leveraging a surrogate VLM to understand and construct high-level risky scenarios that are likely to result in critical errors in the current driving contexts. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple AD VLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that CAD achieves state-of-the-art attack effectiveness, significantly outperforming existing methods (+13.43% on average). Moreover, we validate its practical applicability through real-world attacks on AD vehicles powered by VLMs, where the route completion rate drops by 61.11% and the vehicle crashes directly into the obstacle vehicle with adversarial patches. Finally, we release CADA dataset, comprising 18,808 adversarial visual-question-answer pairs, to facilitate further evaluation and research in this critical domain. Our codes and dataset will be available after paper's acceptance.</p></details> |  |

Known as online action detection, this task requires classifying actions in streaming videos, handling background noise, and coping with incomplete actions. Transformer architectures are the current state-of-the-art, yet the potential of recent advancements in computer vision, particularly vision-language models (VLMs), remains largely untapped for this problem, partly due to high computational costs. In this paper, we introduce TOAD: a Text-driven Online Action Detection architecture that supports zero-shot and few-shot learning. TOAD leverages CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) textual embeddings, enabling efficient use of VLMs without significant computational overhead. Our model achieves 82.46% mAP on the THUMOS14 dataset, outperforming existing methods, and sets new baselines for zero-shot and few-shot performance on the THUMOS14 and TVSeries datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Integrated Computer-Aided Engineering</p></details> |
| **[Knowledge-Informed Multi-Agent Trajectory Prediction at Signalized Intersections for Infrastructure-to-Everything](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13461v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent trajectory prediction at signalized intersections is crucial for developing efficient intelligent transportation systems and safe autonomous driving systems. Due to the complexity of intersection scenarios and the limitations of single-vehicle perception, the performance of vehicle-centric prediction methods has reached a plateau. Furthermore, most works underutilize critical intersection information, including traffic signals, and behavior patterns induced by road structures. Therefore, we propose a multi-agent trajectory prediction framework at signalized intersections dedicated to Infrastructure-to-Everything (I2XTraj). Our framework leverages dynamic graph attention to integrate knowledge from traffic signals and driving behaviors. A continuous signal-informed mechanism is proposed to adaptively process real-time traffic signals from infrastructure devices. Additionally, leveraging the prior knowledge of the intersection topology, we propose a driving strategy awareness mechanism to model the joint distribution of goal intentions and maneuvers. To the best of our knowledge, I2XTraj represents the first multi-agent trajectory prediction framework explicitly designed for infrastructure deployment, supplying subscribable prediction services to all vehicles at intersections. I2XTraj demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on both the Vehicle-to-Infrastructure dataset V2X-Seq and the aerial-view dataset SinD for signalized intersections. Quantitative evaluations show that our approach outperforms existing methods by more than 30% in both multi-agent and single-agent scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[TASAR: Transfer-based Attack on Skeletal Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02483v3)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Skeletal sequences, as well-structured representations of human behaviors, play a vital role in Human Activity Recognition (HAR). The transferability of adversarial skeletal sequences enables attacks in real-world HAR scenarios, such as autonomous driving, intelligent surveillance, and human-computer interactions. However, most existing skeleton-based HAR (S-HAR) attacks are primarily designed for white-box scenarios and exhibit weak adversarial transferability. Therefore, they cannot be considered true transfer-based S-HAR attacks. More importantly, the reason for this failure remains unclear. In this paper, we study this phenomenon through the lens of loss surface, and find that its sharpness contributes to the weak transferability in S-HAR. Inspired by this observation, we assume and empirically validate that smoothening the rugged loss landscape could potentially improve adversarial transferability in S-HAR. To this end, we propose the first \textbf{T}ransfer-based \textbf{A}ttack on \textbf{S}keletal \textbf{A}ction \textbf{R}ecognition, TASAR. TASAR explores the smoothed model posterior without requiring surrogate re-training, which is achieved by a new post-train Dual Bayesian optimization strategy. Furthermore, unlike previous transfer-based attacks that treat each frame independently and overlook temporal coherence within sequences, TASAR incorporates motion dynamics into the Bayesian attack gradient, effectively disrupting the spatial-temporal coherence of S-HARs. To exhaustively evaluate the effectiveness of existing methods and our method, we build the first large-scale robust S-HAR benchmark, comprising 7 S-HAR models, 10 attack methods, 3 S-HAR datasets and 2 defense methods. Extensive results demonstrate the superiority of TASAR. Our benchmark enables easy comparisons for future studies, with the code available in the supplementary material.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2407.08572</p></details> |

Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled precise 3D mapping and scene understanding by rendering photo-realistic images. However, existing 3DGS methods often struggle to accurately reconstruct a 3D map that reflects the actual scale and geometry of the real world, which degrades localization performance. To address these limitations, we propose a novel 3DGS method called Geometry-Aware Gaussian Splatting (GeomGS). This method fully integrates LiDAR data into 3D Gaussian primitives via a probabilistic approach, as opposed to approaches that only use LiDAR as initial points or introduce simple constraints for Gaussian points. To this end, we introduce a Geometric Confidence Score (GCS), which identifies the structural reliability of each Gaussian point. The GCS is optimized simultaneously with Gaussians under probabilistic distance constraints to construct a precise structure. Furthermore, we propose a novel localization method that fully utilizes both the geometric and photometric properties of GeomGS. Our GeomGS demonstrates state-of-the-art geometric and localization performance across several benchmarks, while also improving photometric performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, Under review</p></details> |
| **[AdaWM: Adaptive World Model based Planning for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13072v2)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>World model based reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach for autonomous driving, which learns a latent dynamics model and uses it to train a planning policy. To speed up the learning process, the pretrain-finetune paradigm is often used, where online RL is initialized by a pretrained model and a policy learned offline. However, naively performing such initialization in RL may result in dramatic performance degradation during the online interactions in the new task. To tackle this challenge, we first analyze the performance degradation and identify two primary root causes therein: the mismatch of the planning policy and the mismatch of the dynamics model, due to distribution shift. We further analyze the effects of these factors on performance degradation during finetuning, and our findings reveal that the choice of finetuning strategies plays a pivotal role in mitigating these effects. We then introduce AdaWM, an Adaptive World Model based planning method, featuring two key steps: (a) mismatch identification, which quantifies the mismatches and informs the finetuning strategy, and (b) alignment-driven finetuning, which selectively updates either the policy or the model as needed using efficient low-rank updates. Extensive experiments on the challenging CARLA driving tasks demonstrate that AdaWM significantly improves the finetuning process, resulting in more robust and efficient performance in autonomous driving systems.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

The proposed module enables feature extraction in a reduced-dimensional space, significantly decreasing the number of parallel evaluations required in typical quantum convolutional neural network architectures. Its design allows seamless integration into deep classical neural networks, making it particularly suitable for hybrid quantum-classical models. As an application of QuFeX, we propose Qu-Net -- a hybrid architecture which integrates QuFeX at the bottleneck of a U-Net architecture. The latter is widely used for image segmentation tasks such as medical imaging and autonomous driving. Our numerical analysis indicates that the Qu-Net can achieve superior segmentation performance compared to a U-Net baseline. These results highlight the potential of QuFeX to enhance deep neural networks by leveraging hybrid computational paradigms, providing a path towards a robust framework for real-world applications requiring precise feature extraction.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures |

However, existing LiDAR NVS methods typically rely on neural radiance fields (NeRF) as their 3D representation, which incurs significant computational costs in both training and rendering. Moreover, NeRF and its variants are designed for symmetrical scenes, making them ill-suited for driving scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose GS-LiDAR, a novel framework for generating realistic LiDAR point clouds with panoramic Gaussian splatting. Our approach employs 2D Gaussian primitives with periodic vibration properties, allowing for precise geometric reconstruction of both static and dynamic elements in driving scenarios. We further introduce a novel panoramic rendering technique with explicit ray-splat intersection, guided by panoramic LiDAR supervision. By incorporating intensity and ray-drop spherical harmonic (SH) coefficients into the Gaussian primitives, we enhance the realism of the rendered point clouds. Extensive experiments on KITTI-360 and nuScenes demonstrate the superiority of our method in terms of quantitative metrics, visual quality, as well as training and rendering efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Int2Planner: An Intention-based Multi-modal Motion Planner for Integrated Prediction and Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12799v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motion planning is a critical module in autonomous driving, with the primary challenge of uncertainty caused by interactions with other participants. As most previous methods treat prediction and planning as separate tasks, it is difficult to model these interactions. Furthermore, since the route path navigates ego vehicles to a predefined destination, it provides relatively stable intentions for ego vehicles and helps constrain uncertainty. On this basis, we construct Int2Planner, an \textbf{Int}ention-based \textbf{Int}egrated motion \textbf{Planner} achieves multi-modal planning and prediction. Instead of static intention points, Int2Planner utilizes route intention points for ego vehicles and generates corresponding planning trajectories for each intention point to facilitate multi-modal planning. The experiments on the private dataset and the public nuPlan benchmark show the effectiveness of route intention points, and Int2Planner achieves state-of-the-art performance. We also deploy it in real-world vehicles and have conducted autonomous driving for hundreds of kilometers in urban areas. It further verifies that Int2Planner can continuously interact with the traffic environment. Code will be avaliable at https://github.com/cxlz/Int2Planner.</p></details> |  |

To address this challenge, we propose a novel merging control scheme based on reinforcement learning, which integrates lateral control mechanisms. This approach ensures the smooth integration of vehicles from the merging lane onto the main road, optimizing both fuel efficiency and passenger comfort. Furthermore, we recognize the impact of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication on control strategies and introduce an enhanced protocol leveraging Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) Mode 4. This protocol aims to reduce the Age of Information (AoI) and improve communication reliability. In our simulations, we employ two AoI-based metrics to rigorously assess the protocol's effectiveness in autonomous driving scenarios. By combining the NS3 network simulator with Python, we simulate V2V communication and vehicle control simultaneously. The results demonstrate that the enhanced C-V2X Mode 4 outperforms the standard version, while the proposed control scheme ensures safe and reliable vehicle operation during on-ramp merging.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been submitted to IEEE Journal.

| **[Improved Detection and Diagnosis of Faults in Deep Neural Networks Using Hierarchical and Explainable Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12560v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep Neural Networks (DNN) have found numerous applications in various domains, including fraud detection, medical diagnosis, facial recognition, and autonomous driving. However, DNN-based systems often suffer from reliability issues due to their inherent complexity and the stochastic nature of their underlying models. Unfortunately, existing techniques to detect faults in DNN programs are either limited by the types of faults (e.g., hyperparameter or layer) they support or the kind of information (e.g., dynamic or static) they use. As a result, they might fall short of comprehensively detecting and diagnosing the faults. In this paper, we present DEFault (Detect and Explain Fault) -- a novel technique to detect and diagnose faults in DNN programs. It first captures dynamic (i.e., runtime) features during model training and leverages a hierarchical classification approach to detect all major fault categories from the literature. Then, it captures static features (e.g., layer types) from DNN programs and leverages explainable AI methods (e.g., SHAP) to narrow down the root cause of the fault. We train and evaluate DEFault on a large, diverse dataset of ~14.5K DNN programs and further validate our technique using a benchmark dataset of 52 real-life faulty DNN programs. Our approach achieves ~94% recall in detecting real-world faulty DNN programs and ~63% recall in diagnosing the root causes of the faults, demonstrating 3.92% - 11.54% higher performance than that of state-of-the-art techniques. Thus, DEFault has the potential to significantly improve the reliability of DNN programs by effectively detecting and diagnosing the faults.</p></details> |  |
| **[RALAD: Bridging the Real-to-Sim Domain Gap in Autonomous Driving with Retrieval-Augmented Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12296v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the pursuit of robust autonomous driving systems, models trained on real-world datasets often struggle to adapt to new environments, particularly when confronted with corner cases such as extreme weather conditions. Collecting these corner cases in the real world is non-trivial, which necessitates the use of simulators for validation. However,the high computational cost and the domain gap in data distribution have hindered the seamless transition between real and simulated driving scenarios. To tackle this challenge, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Learning for Autonomous Driving (RALAD), a novel framework designed to bridge the real-to-sim gap at a low cost. RALAD features three primary designs, including (1) domain adaptation via an enhanced Optimal Transport (OT) method that accounts for both individual and grouped image distances, (2) a simple and unified framework that can be applied to various models, and (3) efficient fine-tuning techniques that freeze the computationally expensive layers while maintaining robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that RALAD compensates for the performance degradation in simulated environments while maintaining accuracy in real-world scenarios across three different models. Taking Cross View as an example, the mIOU and mAP metrics in real-world scenarios remain stable before and after RALAD fine-tuning, while in simulated environments,the mIOU and mAP metrics are improved by 10.30% and 12.29%, respectively. Moreover, the re-training cost of our approach is reduced by approximately 88.1%. Our code is available at https://github.com/JiachengZuo/RALAD.git.</p></details> |  |
| **[Video Deblurring by Sharpness Prior Detection and Edge Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12246v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video deblurring is essential task for autonomous driving, facial recognition, and security surveillance. Traditional methods directly estimate motion blur kernels, often introducing artifacts and leading to poor results. Recent approaches utilize the detection of sharp frames within video sequences to enhance deblurring. However, existing datasets rely on fixed number of sharp frames, which may be too restrictive for some applications and may introduce a bias during model training. To address these limitations and enhance domain adaptability, this work first introduces GoPro Random Sharp (GoProRS), a new dataset where the the frequency of sharp frames within the sequence is customizable, allowing more diverse training and testing scenarios. Furthermore, it presents a novel video deblurring model, called SPEINet, that integrates sharp frame features into blurry frame reconstruction through an attention-based encoder-decoder architecture, a lightweight yet robust sharp frame detection and an edge extraction phase. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that SPEINet outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple datasets, achieving an average of +3.2% PSNR improvement over recent techniques. Given such promising results, we believe that both the proposed model and dataset pave the way for future advancements in video deblurring based on the detection of sharp frames.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review in Pattern Recognition</p></details> |
| **[RL-RC-DoT: A Block-level RL agent for Task-Aware Video Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12216v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video encoders optimize compression for human perception by minimizing reconstruction error under bit-rate constraints. In many modern applications such as autonomous driving, an overwhelming majority of videos serve as input for AI systems performing tasks like object recognition or segmentation, rather than being watched by humans. It is therefore useful to optimize the encoder for a downstream task instead of for perceptual image quality. However, a major challenge is how to combine such downstream optimization with existing standard video encoders, which are highly efficient and popular. Here, we address this challenge by controlling the Quantization Parameters (QPs) at the macro-block level to optimize the downstream task. This granular control allows us to prioritize encoding for task-relevant regions within each frame. We formulate this optimization problem as a Reinforcement Learning (RL) task, where the agent learns to balance long-term implications of choosing QPs on both task performance and bit-rate constraints. Notably, our policy does not require the downstream task as an input during inference, making it suitable for streaming applications and edge devices such as vehicles. We demonstrate significant improvements in two tasks, car detection, and ROI (saliency) encoding. Our approach improves task performance for a given bit rate compared to traditional task agnostic encoding methods, paving the way for more efficient task-aware video compression.</p></details> |  |

Given the "less is more" principle that a broadened perceptual horizon possibly confuses the decision module rather than contributing to it, Select2Drive utilizes Area-of-Importance-based PragComm (APC) to prioritize the communications of critical regions, thus boosting both communication efficiency and decision-making efficacy. Empirical evaluations on the V2Xverse dataset and CARLA driving simulator demonstrate that Select2Drive achieves a 11.31% (resp. 7.69%) improvement in offline perception tasks under limited bandwidth (resp. pose error conditions). Moreover, it delivers at most 14.68% and 31.76% enhancement in closed-loop driving scores and route completion rates, particularly in scenarios characterized by dense traffic and high-speed dynamics.</p></details> |  |

We demonstrate the effectiveness of RadaRays through a series of experiments and show that it can more accurately reproduce the behavior of FMCW radar sensors in a variety of environments, compared to the ray casting-based lidar-like simulations that are commonly used in simulators for autonomous driving such as CARLA. Our experiments additionally serve as a valuable reference point for researchers to evaluate their own radar simulations. By using RadaRays, developers can significantly reduce the time and cost associated with prototyping and testing FMCW radar-based algorithms.

| **[Make Full Use of Testing Information: An Integrated Accelerated Testing and Evaluation Method for Autonomous Driving Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11924v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Testing and evaluation is an important step before the large-scale application of the autonomous driving systems (ADSs). Based on the three level of scenario abstraction theory, a testing can be performed within a logical scenario, followed by an evaluation stage which is inputted with the testing results of each concrete scenario generated from the logical parameter space. During the above process, abundant testing information is produced which is beneficial for comprehensive and accurate evaluations. To make full use of testing information, this paper proposes an Integrated accelerated Testing and Evaluation Method (ITEM). Based on a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) paradigm and a dual surrogates testing framework proposed in our previous work, this paper applies the intermediate information (i.e., the tree structure, including the affiliation of each historical sampled point with the subspaces and the parent-child relationship between subspaces) generated during the testing stage into the evaluation stage to achieve accurate hazardous domain identification. Moreover, to better serve this purpose, the UCB calculation method is improved to allow the search algorithm to focus more on the hazardous domain boundaries. Further, a stopping condition is constructed based on the convergence of the search algorithm. Ablation and comparative experiments are then conducted to verify the effectiveness of the improvements and the superiority of the proposed method. The experimental results show that ITEM could well identify the hazardous domains in both low- and high-dimensional cases, regardless of the shape of the hazardous domains, indicating its generality and potential for the safety evaluation of ADSs.</p></details> | 15 pages, 11 figures |

While deep learning-based MDE methods can predict relative depth from a single image, their lack of metric scale information often results in scale inconsistencies, limiting their utility in downstream tasks like visual SLAM, 3D reconstruction, and novel view synthesis. Monocular Metric Depth Estimation (MMDE) addresses these challenges by enabling precise, scene-scale depth inference. MMDE improves depth consistency, enhances sequential task stability, simplifies integration into downstream applications, and broadens practical use cases. This paper provides a comprehensive review of depth estimation technologies, highlighting the evolution from geometry-based methods to state-of-the-art deep learning approaches. It emphasizes advancements in scale-agnostic methods, which are crucial for enabling zero-shot generalization as the foundational capability for MMDE. Recent progress in zero-shot MMDE research is explored, focusing on challenges such as model generalization and the loss of detail at scene boundaries. Innovative strategies to address these issues include unlabelled data augmentation, image patching, architectural optimization, and generative techniques. These advancements, analyzed in detail, demonstrate significant contributions to overcoming existing limitations. Finally, this paper synthesizes recent developments in zero-shot MMDE, identifies unresolved challenges, and outlines future research directions. By offering a clear roadmap and cutting-edge insights, this work aims to deepen understanding of MMDE, inspire novel applications, and drive technological innovation.</p></details> |  |

Ironically, object detection for drones has always been conducted in the 2D image space, which fundamentally limits their ability to understand 3D scenes. Furthermore, existing 3D object detection methods developed for autonomous driving cannot be directly applied to drones due to the lack of deformation modeling, which is essential for the distant aerial perspective with sensitive distortion and small objects. To fill the gap, this work proposes a dual-view detection system named DVDET to achieve aerial monocular object detection in both the 2D image space and the 3D physical space. To address the severe view deformation issue, we propose a novel trainable geo-deformable transformation module that can properly warp information from the drone's perspective to the BEV. Compared to the monocular methods for cars, our transformation includes a learnable deformable network for explicitly revising the severe deviation. To address the dataset challenge, we propose a new large-scale simulation dataset named AM3D-Sim, generated by the co-simulation of AirSIM and CARLA, and a new real-world aerial dataset named AM3D-Real, collected by DJI Matrice 300 RTK, in both datasets, high-quality annotations for 3D object detection are provided. Extensive experiments show that i) aerial monocular 3D object detection is feasible; ii) the model pre-trained on the simulation dataset benefits real-world performance, and iii) DVDET also benefits monocular 3D object detection for cars. To encourage more researchers to investigate this area, we will release the dataset and related code in https://github.com/PhyllisH/DVDET.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |

A key point of the proposed method is that the translation vector between the two-bodies is modeled using the double-centering operator from multidimensional scaling (MDS) theory, enabling the method to be used between rigid bodies regardless of their shapes, in contrast to conventional approaches which require both bodies to have the same shape. Simulation results illustrate the good performance of the proposed technique in terms of root mean square error (RMSE) of the estimates in different setups.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2501.10219</p></details> |

However, generating long-duration, surround-view consistent driving videos remains a significant challenge. To address this, we present UniMLVG, a unified framework designed to generate extended street multi-perspective videos under precise control. By integrating single- and multi-view driving videos into the training data, our approach updates cross-frame and cross-view modules across three stages with different training objectives, substantially boosting the diversity and quality of generated visual content. Additionally, we employ the explicit viewpoint modeling in multi-view video generation to effectively improve motion transition consistency. Capable of handling various input reference formats (e.g., text, images, or video), our UniMLVG generates high-quality multi-view videos according to the corresponding condition constraints such as 3D bounding boxes or frame-level text descriptions. Compared to the best models with similar capabilities, our framework achieves improvements of 21.4% in FID and 36.5% in FVD.</p></details> |  |

This can cause serious consequences in high-stake applications, such as autonomous driving, medical diagnosis, and disaster response. Uncertainty quantification (UQ) aims to estimate the confidence of DNN predictions beyond prediction accuracy. In recent years, many UQ methods have been developed for DNNs. It is of great practical value to systematically categorize these UQ methods and compare their advantages and disadvantages. However, existing surveys mostly focus on categorizing UQ methodologies from a neural network architecture perspective or a Bayesian perspective and ignore the source of uncertainty that each methodology can incorporate, making it difficult to select an appropriate UQ method in practice. To fill the gap, this paper presents a systematic taxonomy of UQ methods for DNNs based on the types of uncertainty sources (data uncertainty versus model uncertainty). We summarize the advantages and disadvantages of methods in each category. We show how our taxonomy of UQ methodologies can potentially help guide the choice of UQ method in different machine learning problems (e.g., active learning, robustness, and reinforcement learning). We also identify current research gaps and propose several future research directions.</p></details> | 39 pages, 13 figures |

However, due to the distinctive properties of cars, such as highly reflective and transparent surface materials, existing methods often struggle to achieve accurate 3D car reconstruction.To address these limitations, we propose Car-GS, a novel approach designed to mitigate the effects of specular highlights and the coupling of RGB and geometry in 3D geometric and shading reconstruction (3DGS). Our method incorporates three key innovations: First, we introduce view-dependent Gaussian primitives to effectively model surface reflections. Second, we identify the limitations of using a shared opacity parameter for both image rendering and geometric attributes when modeling transparent objects. To overcome this, we assign a learnable geometry-specific opacity to each 2D Gaussian primitive, dedicated solely to rendering depth and normals. Third, we observe that reconstruction errors are most prominent when the camera view is nearly orthogonal to glass surfaces. To address this issue, we develop a quality-aware supervision module that adaptively leverages normal priors from a pre-trained large-scale normal model.Experimental results demonstrate that Car-GS achieves precise reconstruction of car surfaces and significantly outperforms prior methods.

We evaluate the effectiveness of a novel GNN-based U-Net architecture on three distinct datasets: PascalVOC, a standard benchmark for natural image segmentation, WoodScape, a challenging dataset of fisheye images commonly used in autonomous driving, introducing significant geometric distortions; and ISIC2016, a dataset of dermoscopic images for skin lesion segmentation. We compare our proposed UNet-GNN model against established convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based segmentation models, including U-Net and U-Net++, as well as the transformer-based SwinUNet. Unlike these methods, which primarily rely on local convolutional operations or global self-attention, GNNs explicitly model relationships between image regions by constructing and operating on a graph representation of the image features. This approach allows the model to capture long-range dependencies and complex spatial relationships, which we hypothesize will be particularly beneficial for handling geometric distortions present in fisheye imagery and capturing intricate boundaries in medical images. Our analysis demonstrates the versatility of GNNs in addressing diverse segmentation challenges and highlights their potential to improve segmentation accuracy in various applications, including autonomous driving and medical image analysis.</p></details> |  |

A critical task in AAV operations is headland turning between crop rows. This task is challenging in orchards with limited headland space, irregular boundaries, operational constraints, and static obstacles. While traditional trajectory planning methods work well in arable farming, they often fail in cluttered orchard environments. This letter presents a novel trajectory planner that enhances the safety and efficiency of AAV headland maneuvers, leveraging advancements in autonomous driving. Our approach includes an efficient front-end algorithm and a high-performance back-end optimization. Applied to vehicles with various implements, it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both standard and challenging orchard fields. This work bridges agricultural and autonomous driving technologies, facilitating a broader adoption of AAVs in complex orchards.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Learning Informative Trajectory Embeddings for Imitation, Classification and Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09327v2)** | 2025-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real-world sequential decision making tasks like autonomous driving, robotics, and healthcare, learning from observed state-action trajectories is critical for tasks like imitation, classification, and clustering. For example, self-driving cars must replicate human driving behaviors, while robots and healthcare systems benefit from modeling decision sequences, whether or not they come from expert data. Existing trajectory encoding methods often focus on specific tasks or rely on reward signals, limiting their ability to generalize across domains and tasks. Inspired by the success of embedding models like CLIP and BERT in static domains, we propose a novel method for embedding state-action trajectories into a latent space that captures the skills and competencies in the dynamic underlying decision-making processes. This method operates without the need for reward labels, enabling better generalization across diverse domains and tasks. Our contributions are threefold: (1) We introduce a trajectory embedding approach that captures multiple abilities from state-action data. (2) The learned embeddings exhibit strong representational power across downstream tasks, including imitation, classification, clustering, and regression. (3) The embeddings demonstrate unique properties, such as controlling agent behaviors in IQ-Learn and an additive structure in the latent space. Experimental results confirm that our method outperforms traditional approaches, offering more flexible and powerful trajectory representations for various applications.

Recent studies highlight the effectiveness of fusing radar and LiDAR point clouds. However, challenges remain due to the modality misalignment and information loss during feature extractions. To address these issues, we propose a 4D radar-LiDAR framework to mutually enhance their representations. Initially, the indicative features from radar are utilized to guide both radar and LiDAR geometric feature learning. Subsequently, to mitigate their sparsity gap, the shape information from LiDAR is used to enrich radar BEV features. Extensive experiments on the View-of-Delft (VoD) dataset demonstrate our approach's superiority over existing methods, achieving the highest mAP of 71.76% across the entire area and 86.36\% within the driving corridor. Especially for cars, we improve the AP by 4.17% and 4.20% due to the strong indicative features and symmetric shapes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICASSP 2025</p></details> |

They embed extensive knowledge about the driving environment, facilitating safe and scalable autonomous driving. Most existing methods primarily focus on either data generation or the pretraining paradigms of world models. Unlike the aforementioned prior works, we propose Drive-OccWorld, which adapts a vision-centric 4D forecasting world model to end-to-end planning for autonomous driving. Specifically, we first introduce a semantic and motion-conditional normalization in the memory module, which accumulates semantic and dynamic information from historical BEV embeddings. These BEV features are then conveyed to the world decoder for future occupancy and flow forecasting, considering both geometry and spatiotemporal modeling. Additionally, we propose injecting flexible action conditions, such as velocity, steering angle, trajectory, and commands, into the world model to enable controllable generation and facilitate a broader range of downstream applications. Furthermore, we explore integrating the generative capabilities of the 4D world model with end-to-end planning, enabling continuous forecasting of future states and the selection of optimal trajectories using an occupancy-based cost function. Comprehensive experiments conducted on the nuScenes, nuScenes-Occupancy, and Lyft-Level5 datasets illustrate that our method can generate plausible and controllable 4D occupancy, paving the way for advancements in driving world generation and end-to-end planning.

However, the decision logic of these frameworks is often not transparent, making it difficult for stakeholders to understand, interpret or explain their behavior. This limitation hinders trust in machine learning systems and causes a general reluctance towards their adoption in practical applications, particularly in mission-critical domains like healthcare and autonomous driving. Explainable AI (XAI) techniques facilitate the explainability or interpretability of machine learning models, enabling users to discern the basis of the decision and possibly avert undesirable behavior. This comprehensive survey details the advancements of explainable AI methods, from inherently interpretable models to modern approaches for achieving interpretability of various black box models, including large language models (LLMs). Additionally, we review explainable AI techniques that leverage LLM and vision-language model (VLM) frameworks to automate or improve the explainability of other machine learning models. The use of LLM and VLM as interpretability methods particularly enables high-level, semantically meaningful explanations of model decisions and behavior. Throughout the paper, we highlight the scientific principles, strengths and weaknesses of state-of-the-art methods and outline different areas of improvement. Where appropriate, we also present qualitative and quantitative comparison results of various methods to show how they compare. Finally, we discuss the key challenges of XAI and directions for future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Systematic Study of Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning for Safe and Robust Autonomous Highway Ramp Entry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14593v2)** | 2025-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vehicles today can drive themselves on highways and driverless robotaxis operate in major cities, with more sophisticated levels of autonomous driving expected to be available and become more common in the future. Yet, technically speaking, so-called "Level 5" (L5) operation, corresponding to full autonomy, has not been achieved. For that to happen, functions such as fully autonomous highway ramp entry must be available, and provide provably safe, and reliably robust behavior to enable full autonomy. We present a systematic study of a highway ramp function that controls the vehicles forward-moving actions to minimize collisions with the stream of highway traffic into which a merging (ego) vehicle enters. We take a game-theoretic multi-agent (MA) approach to this problem and study the use of controllers based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The virtual environment of the MA DRL uses self-play with simulated data where merging vehicles safely learn to control longitudinal position during a taper-type merge. The work presented in this paper extends existing work by studying the interaction of more than two vehicles (agents) and does so by systematically expanding the road scene with additional traffic and ego vehicles. While previous work on the two-vehicle setting established that collision-free controllers are theoretically impossible in fully decentralized, non-coordinated environments, we empirically show that controllers learned using our approach are nearly ideal when measured against idealized optimal controllers.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 9 figures; added support ack</p></details> |

Existing ADS testing works focuses on designing scenarios to evaluate system-level behaviors, while fine-grained testing of ADS source code has received comparatively little attention. To address this gap, we present the first study on testing, specifically unit testing, for ADS source code. Our study focuses on an industrial ADS framework, Autoware. We analyze both human-written test cases and those generated by large language models (LLMs). Our findings reveal that human-written test cases in Autoware exhibit limited test coverage, and significant challenges remain in applying LLM-generated tests for Autoware unit testing. To overcome these challenges, we propose AwTest-LLM, a novel approach to enhance test coverage and improve test case pass rates across Autoware packages.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforcement learning with non-ergodic reward increments: robustness via ergodicity transformations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11335v3)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Envisioned application areas for reinforcement learning (RL) include autonomous driving, precision agriculture, and finance, which all require RL agents to make decisions in the real world. A significant challenge hindering the adoption of RL methods in these domains is the non-robustness of conventional algorithms. In particular, the focus of RL is typically on the expected value of the return. The expected value is the average over the statistical ensemble of infinitely many trajectories, which can be uninformative about the performance of the average individual. For instance, when we have a heavy-tailed return distribution, the ensemble average can be dominated by rare extreme events. Consequently, optimizing the expected value can lead to policies that yield exceptionally high returns with a probability that approaches zero but almost surely result in catastrophic outcomes in single long trajectories. In this paper, we develop an algorithm that lets RL agents optimize the long-term performance of individual trajectories. The algorithm enables the agents to learn robust policies, which we show in an instructive example with a heavy-tailed return distribution and standard RL benchmarks. The key element of the algorithm is a transformation that we learn from data. This transformation turns the time series of collected returns into one for whose increments expected value and the average over a long trajectory coincide. Optimizing these increments results in robust policies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted final version to appear in the Transactions on Machine Learning Research</p></details> |
| **[Distilling Multi-modal Large Language Models for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09757v1)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous driving demands safe motion planning, especially in critical "long-tail" scenarios. Recent end-to-end autonomous driving systems leverage large language models (LLMs) as planners to improve generalizability to rare events. However, using LLMs at test time introduces high computational costs. To address this, we propose DiMA, an end-to-end autonomous driving system that maintains the efficiency of an LLM-free (or vision-based) planner while leveraging the world knowledge of an LLM. DiMA distills the information from a multi-modal LLM to a vision-based end-to-end planner through a set of specially designed surrogate tasks. Under a joint training strategy, a scene encoder common to both networks produces structured representations that are semantically grounded as well as aligned to the final planning objective. Notably, the LLM is optional at inference, enabling robust planning without compromising on efficiency. Training with DiMA results in a 37% reduction in the L2 trajectory error and an 80% reduction in the collision rate of the vision-based planner, as well as a 44% trajectory error reduction in longtail scenarios. DiMA also achieves state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes planning benchmark.</p></details> |  |

However, they often suffer from overconfidence and poor explainability, especially for out-of-domain data. While uncertainty quantification has emerged as a promising solution to these challenges, multi-task settings have yet to be explored. In an effort to shed light on this, we evaluate Monte Carlo Dropout, Deep Sub-Ensembles, and Deep Ensembles for joint semantic segmentation and monocular depth estimation. Thereby, we reveal that Deep Ensembles stand out as the preferred choice, particularly in out-of-domain scenarios, and show the potential benefit of multi-task learning with regard to the uncertainty quality in comparison to solving both tasks separately. Additionally, we highlight the impact of employing different uncertainty thresholds to classify pixels as certain or uncertain, with the median uncertainty emerging as a robust default.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript is an extended version of a previously published conference paper and is currently in review for a journal</p></details> |
| **[The Devil is in the Details: Simple Remedies for Image-to-LiDAR Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09485v1)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR is a crucial sensor in autonomous driving, commonly used alongside cameras. By exploiting this camera-LiDAR setup and recent advances in image representation learning, prior studies have shown the promising potential of image-to-LiDAR distillation. These prior arts focus on the designs of their own losses to effectively distill the pre-trained 2D image representations into a 3D model. However, the other parts of the designs have been surprisingly unexplored. We find that fundamental design elements, e.g., the LiDAR coordinate system, quantization according to the existing input interface, and data utilization, are more critical than developing loss functions, which have been overlooked in prior works. In this work, we show that simple fixes to these designs notably outperform existing methods by 16% in 3D semantic segmentation on the nuScenes dataset and 13% in 3D object detection on the KITTI dataset in downstream task performance. We focus on overlooked design choices along the spatial and temporal axes. Spatially, prior work has used cylindrical coordinate and voxel sizes without considering their side effects yielded with a commonly deployed sparse convolution layer input interface, leading to spatial quantization errors in 3D models. Temporally, existing work has avoided cumbersome data curation by discarding unsynced data, limiting the use to only the small portion of data that is temporally synced across sensors. We analyze these effects and propose simple solutions for each overlooked aspect.</p></details> | Accepted to ACCV2024 |

Traditionally, 3D object detection methods are trained in a fully-supervised setup, requiring vast amounts of human annotations, which are laborious, costly, and do not scale well with the ever-increasing amounts of data being captured. In this paper, we present the first method to train 3D object detectors for monocular RGB cameras without domain-specific human annotations, thus making orders of magnitude more data available for training. Thanks to newly proposed Canonical Object Space, the method can not only exploit data across a variety of datasets and camera setups to train a single 3D detector, but unlike previous work it also works out of the box in previously unseen camera setups. All this is crucial for practical applications, where the data and cameras are extremely heterogeneous. The method is evaluated on two standard autonomous driving datasets, where it outperforms previous works, which, unlike our method, still rely on 2D human annotations.</p></details> |  |

While recent approaches adapt VLMs to driving via single-round visual question answering (VQA), human drivers reason about decisions in multiple steps. Starting from the localization of key objects, humans estimate object interactions before taking actions. The key insight is that with our proposed task, Graph VQA, where we model graph-structured reasoning through perception, prediction and planning question-answer pairs, we obtain a suitable proxy task to mimic the human reasoning process. We instantiate datasets (DriveLM-Data) built upon nuScenes and CARLA, and propose a VLM-based baseline approach (DriveLM-Agent) for jointly performing Graph VQA and end-to-end driving. The experiments demonstrate that Graph VQA provides a simple, principled framework for reasoning about a driving scene, and DriveLM-Data provides a challenging benchmark for this task. Our DriveLM-Agent baseline performs end-to-end autonomous driving competitively in comparison to state-of-the-art driving-specific architectures. Notably, its benefits are pronounced when it is evaluated zero-shot on unseen objects or sensor configurations. We hope this work can be the starting point to shed new light on how to apply VLMs for autonomous driving. To facilitate future research, all code, data, and models are available to the public.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ECCV 2024 as Oral paper</p></details> |

However, achieving real-time object detection on edge devices presents significant challenges due to their limited computational resources and the high demands of deep neural network (DNN)-based detection models, particularly when processing high-resolution video. Conventional strategies, such as input down-sampling and network up-scaling, often compromise detection accuracy for faster performance or lead to higher inference latency. To address these issues, this paper introduces RE-POSE, a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-Driven Partitioning and Edge Offloading framework designed to optimize the accuracy-latency trade-off in resource-constrained edge environments. Our approach features an RL-Based Dynamic Clustering Algorithm (RL-DCA) that partitions video frames into non-uniform blocks based on object distribution and the computational characteristics of DNNs. Furthermore, a parallel edge offloading scheme is implemented to distribute these blocks across multiple edge servers for concurrent processing. Experimental evaluations show that RE-POSE significantly enhances detection accuracy and reduces inference latency, surpassing existing methods.</p></details> |  |

Given the inherent limitations of standalone sensors, integrating heterogeneous sensors with complementary capabilities is one of the most effective approaches to achieving this goal. In this paper, we propose a filtering-based, tightly coupled global navigation satellite system (GNSS)-visual-inertial positioning framework with a pose-only formulation applied to the visual-inertial system (VINS), termed PO-GVINS. Specifically, multiple-view imaging used in current VINS requires a priori of 3D feature, then jointly estimate camera poses and 3D feature position, which inevitably introduces linearization error of the feature as well as facing dimensional explosion. However, the pose-only (PO) formulation, which is demonstrated to be equivalent to the multiple-view imaging and has been applied in visual reconstruction, represent feature depth using two camera poses and thus 3D feature position is removed from state vector avoiding aforementioned difficulties. Inspired by this, we first apply PO formulation in our VINS, i.e., PO-VINS. GNSS raw measurements are then incorporated with integer ambiguity resolved to achieve accurate and drift-free estimation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed PO-VINS significantly outperforms the multi-state constrained Kalman filter (MSCKF). By incorporating GNSS measurements, PO-GVINS achieves accurate, drift-free state estimation, making it a robust solution for positioning in challenging environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling Language for Scenario Development of Autonomous Driving Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09319v1)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous driving systems are typically verified based on scenarios. To represent the positions and movements of cars in these scenarios, diagrams that utilize icons are typically employed. However, the interpretation of such diagrams is typically ambiguous, which can lead to misunderstandings among users, making them unsuitable for the development of high-reliability systems. To address this issue, this study introduces a notation called the car position diagram (CPD). The CPD allows for the concise representation of numerous scenarios and is particularly suitable for scenario analysis and design. In addition, we propose a method for converting CPD-based models into propositional logic formulas and enumerating all scenarios using a SAT solver. A tool for scenario enumeration is implemented, and experiments are conducted on both typical car behaviors and international standards. The results demonstrate that the CPD enables the concise description of numerous scenarios, thereby confirming the effectiveness of our scenario analysis method.</p></details> |  |

Significant progress has been made in data-driven VO methods, particularly those leveraging deep learning techniques to extract image features and estimate camera poses. However, these methods often struggle in low-light conditions because of the reduced visibility of features and the increased difficulty of matching keypoints. To address this limitation, we introduce BrightVO, a novel VO model based on Transformer architecture, which not only performs front-end visual feature extraction, but also incorporates a multi-modality refinement module in the back-end that integrates Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data. Using pose graph optimization, this module iteratively refines pose estimates to reduce errors and improve both accuracy and robustness. Furthermore, we create a synthetic low-light dataset, KiC4R, which includes a variety of lighting conditions to facilitate the training and evaluation of VO frameworks in challenging environments. Experimental results demonstrate that BrightVO achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the KiC4R dataset and the KITTI benchmarks. Specifically, it provides an average improvement of 20% in pose estimation accuracy in normal outdoor environments and 259% in low-light conditions, outperforming existing methods. For widespread use and further development, the research work is fully open-source at https://github.com/Anastasiawd/BrightVO.</p></details> | <details><summary>We ha...</summary><p>We have identified significant issues in the methodology and data analysis that impact the validity of our conclusions</p></details> |
| **[Autonomous Algorithm for Training Autonomous Vehicles with Minimal Human Intervention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13345v2)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have demonstrated impressive results in simulated driving environments. However, autonomous vehicles trained in simulation often struggle to work well in the real world due to the fidelity gap between simulated and real-world environments. While directly training real-world autonomous vehicles with RL algorithms is a promising approach to bypass the fidelity gap problem, it presents several challenges. One critical yet often overlooked challenge is the need to reset a driving environment between every episode. This reset process demands significant human intervention, leading to poor training efficiency in the real world. In this paper, we introduce a novel autonomous algorithm that enables off-the-shelf RL algorithms to train autonomous vehicles with minimal human intervention. Our algorithm reduces unnecessary human intervention by aborting episodes to prevent unsafe states and identifying informative initial states for subsequent episodes. The key idea behind identifying informative initial states is to estimate the expected amount of information that can be obtained from under-explored but reachable states. Our algorithm also revisits rule-based autonomous driving algorithms and highlights their benefits in safely returning an autonomous vehicle to initial states. To evaluate how much human intervention is required during training, we implement challenging urban driving tasks that require an autonomous vehicle to reset to initial states on its own. The experimental results show that our autonomous algorithm is task-agnostic and achieves competitive driving performance with much less human intervention than baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables, conference</p></details> |

While existing vision-based end-to-end models have achieved promising results, these methods are still facing the challenges of vision understanding, decision reasoning and scene generalization. To solve these issues, a generative planning with 3D-vision language pre-training model named GPVL is proposed for end-to-end autonomous driving. The proposed paradigm has two significant aspects. On one hand, a 3D-vision language pre-training module is designed to bridge the gap between visual perception and linguistic understanding in the bird's eye view. On the other hand, a cross-modal language model is introduced to generate holistic driving decisions and fine-grained trajectories with perception and navigation information in an auto-regressive manner. Experiments on the challenging nuScenes dataset demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves excellent performances compared with state-of-the-art methods. Besides, the proposed GPVL presents strong generalization ability and real-time potential when handling high-level commands in various scenarios. It is believed that the effective, robust and efficient performance of GPVL is crucial for the practical application of future autonomous driving systems.

However, a lack of explainability in real-time decisions with contemporary learning methods impedes user trust and attenuates the widespread deployment and commercialization of such vehicles. Moreover, the issue is exacerbated when these cars are involved in or cause traffic accidents. Consequently, explainability in end-to-end autonomous driving is essential to build trust in vehicular automation. With that said, automotive researchers have not yet rigorously explored safety benefits and consequences of explanations in end-to-end autonomous driving. This paper aims to bridge the gaps between these topics and seeks to answer the following research question: What are safety implications of explanations in end-to-end autonomous driving? In this regard, we first revisit established safety and explainability concepts in end-to-end driving. Furthermore, we present three critical case studies and show the pivotal role of explanations in enhancing self-driving safety. Finally, we describe insights from empirical studies and reveal potential value, limitations, and caveats of practical explainable AI methods with respect to their safety assurance in end-to-end driving.</p></details> |  |

In particular, interpretability has become increasingly essential for applications that demand high safety and knowledge rigor, such as drug discovery, autonomous driving, and genomics. However, progress in understanding even the simplest deep neural networks - such as fully connected networks - has been limited, despite their role as foundational elements in state-of-the-art models like ResNet and Transformer. In this paper, we address this challenge by introducing NeuroLogic, a novel approach for decoding interpretable logic rules from neural networks. NeuroLogic leverages neural activation patterns to capture the model's critical decision-making processes, translating them into logical rules represented by hidden predicates. Thanks to its flexible design in the grounding phase, NeuroLogic can be adapted to a wide range of neural networks. For simple fully connected neural networks, hidden predicates can be grounded in certain split patterns of original input features to derive decision-tree-like rules. For large, complex vision neural networks, NeuroLogic grounds hidden predicates into high-level visual concepts that are understandable to humans. Our empirical study demonstrates that NeuroLogic can extract global and interpretable rules from state-of-the-art models such as ResNet, a task at which existing work struggles. We believe NeuroLogic can help pave the way for understanding the black-box nature of neural networks.</p></details> | 23 pages, 7 figures |

Meanwhile, knowledge-driven autonomous driving systems have evolved considerably with the popularization of visual language models. In this paper, we propose LeapVAD, a novel method based on cognitive perception and dual-process thinking. Our approach implements a human-attentional mechanism to identify and focus on critical traffic elements that influence driving decisions. By characterizing these objects through comprehensive attributes - including appearance, motion patterns, and associated risks - LeapVAD achieves more effective environmental representation and streamlines the decision-making process. Furthermore, LeapVAD incorporates an innovative dual-process decision-making module miming the human-driving learning process. The system consists of an Analytic Process (System-II) that accumulates driving experience through logical reasoning and a Heuristic Process (System-I) that refines this knowledge via fine-tuning and few-shot learning. LeapVAD also includes reflective mechanisms and a growing memory bank, enabling it to learn from past mistakes and continuously improve its performance in a closed-loop environment. To enhance efficiency, we develop a scene encoder network that generates compact scene representations for rapid retrieval of relevant driving experiences. Extensive evaluations conducted on two leading autonomous driving simulators, CARLA and DriveArena, demonstrate that LeapVAD achieves superior performance compared to camera-only approaches despite limited training data. Comprehensive ablation studies further emphasize its effectiveness in continuous learning and domain adaptation. Project page: https://pjlab-adg.github.io/LeapVAD/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hybrid Action Based Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Objective Compatible Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08096v1)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown excellent performance in solving decision-making and control problems of autonomous driving, which is increasingly applied in diverse driving scenarios. However, driving is a multi-attribute problem, leading to challenges in achieving multi-objective compatibility for current RL methods, especially in both policy execution and policy iteration. On the one hand, the common action space structure with single action type limits driving flexibility or results in large behavior fluctuations during policy execution. On the other hand, the multi-attribute weighted single reward function result in the agent's disproportionate attention to certain objectives during policy iterations. To this end, we propose a Multi-objective Ensemble-Critic reinforcement learning method with Hybrid Parametrized Action for multi-objective compatible autonomous driving. Specifically, a parameterized action space is constructed to generate hybrid driving actions, combining both abstract guidance and concrete control commands. A multi-objective critics architecture is constructed considering multiple attribute rewards, to ensure simultaneously focusing on different driving objectives. Additionally, uncertainty-based exploration strategy is introduced to help the agent faster approach viable driving policy. The experimental results in both the simulated traffic environment and the HighD dataset demonstrate that our method can achieve multi-objective compatible autonomous driving in terms of driving efficiency, action consistency, and safety. It enhances the general performance of the driving while significantly increasing training efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 9 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Benchmarking Vision Foundation Models for Input Monitoring in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08083v1)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks (DNNs) remain challenged by distribution shifts in complex open-world domains like automated driving (AD): Absolute robustness against yet unknown novel objects (semantic shift) or styles like lighting conditions (covariate shift) cannot be guaranteed. Hence, reliable operation-time monitors for identification of out-of-training-data-distribution (OOD) scenarios are imperative. Current approaches for OOD classification are untested for complex domains like AD, are limited in the kinds of shifts they detect, or even require supervision with OOD samples. To prepare for unanticipated shifts, we instead establish a framework around a principled, unsupervised, and model-agnostic method that unifies detection of all kinds of shifts: Find a full model of the training data's feature distribution, to then use its density at new points as in-distribution (ID) score. To implement this, we propose to combine the newly available Vision Foundation Models (VFM) as feature extractors with one of four alternative density modeling techniques. In an extensive benchmark of 4 VFMs against 20 baselines, we show the superior performance of VFM feature encodings compared to shift-specific OOD monitors. Additionally, we find that sophisticated architectures outperform larger latent space dimensionality; and our method identifies samples with higher risk of errors on downstream tasks, despite being model-agnostic. This suggests that VFMs are promising to realize model-agnostic, unsupervised, reliable safety monitors in complex vision tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[GAC-Net_Geometric and attention-based Network for Depth Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07988v1)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Depth completion is a key task in autonomous driving, aiming to complete sparse LiDAR depth measurements into high-quality dense depth maps through image guidance. However, existing methods usually treat depth maps as an additional channel of color images, or directly perform convolution on sparse data, failing to fully exploit the 3D geometric information in depth maps, especially with limited performance in complex boundaries and sparse areas. To address these issues, this paper proposes a depth completion network combining channel attention mechanism and 3D global feature perception (CGA-Net). The main innovations include: 1) Utilizing PointNet++ to extract global 3D geometric features from sparse depth maps, enhancing the scene perception ability of low-line LiDAR data; 2) Designing a channel-attention-based multimodal feature fusion module to efficiently integrate sparse depth, RGB images, and 3D geometric features; 3) Combining residual learning with CSPN++ to optimize the depth refinement stage, further improving the completion quality in edge areas and complex scenes. Experiments on the KITTI depth completion dataset show that CGA-Net can significantly improve the prediction accuracy of dense depth maps, achieving a new state-of-the-art (SOTA), and demonstrating strong robustness to sparse and complex scenes.</p></details> | <details><summary>13pag...</summary><p>13pages,4 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[DIDLM: A SLAM Dataset for Difficult Scenarios Featuring Infrared, Depth Cameras, LIDAR, 4D Radar, and Others under Adverse Weather, Low Light Conditions, and Rough Roads](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09622v2)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adverse weather conditions, low-light environments, and bumpy road surfaces pose significant challenges to SLAM in robotic navigation and autonomous driving. Existing datasets in this field predominantly rely on single sensors or combinations of LiDAR, cameras, and IMUs. However, 4D millimeter-wave radar demonstrates robustness in adverse weather, infrared cameras excel in capturing details under low-light conditions, and depth images provide richer spatial information. Multi-sensor fusion methods also show potential for better adaptation to bumpy roads. Despite some SLAM studies incorporating these sensors and conditions, there remains a lack of comprehensive datasets addressing low-light environments and bumpy road conditions, or featuring a sufficiently diverse range of sensor data. In this study, we introduce a multi-sensor dataset covering challenging scenarios such as snowy weather, rainy weather, nighttime conditions, speed bumps, and rough terrains. The dataset includes rarely utilized sensors for extreme conditions, such as 4D millimeter-wave radar, infrared cameras, and depth cameras, alongside 3D LiDAR, RGB cameras, GPS, and IMU. It supports both autonomous driving and ground robot applications and provides reliable GPS/INS ground truth data, covering structured and semi-structured terrains. We evaluated various SLAM algorithms using this dataset, including RGB images, infrared images, depth images, LiDAR, and 4D millimeter-wave radar. The dataset spans a total of 18.5 km, 69 minutes, and approximately 660 GB, offering a valuable resource for advancing SLAM research under complex and extreme conditions.

| **[A Low-cost and Ultra-lightweight Binary Neural Network for Traffic Signal Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07808v1)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The deployment of neural networks in vehicle platforms and wearable Artificial Intelligence-of-Things (AIOT) scenarios has become a research area that has attracted much attention. With the continuous evolution of deep learning technology, many image classification models are committed to improving recognition accuracy, but this is often accompanied by problems such as large model resource usage, complex structure, and high power consumption, which makes it challenging to deploy on resource-constrained platforms. Herein, we propose an ultra-lightweight binary neural network (BNN) model designed for hardware deployment, and conduct image classification research based on the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset. In addition, we also verify it on the Chinese Traffic Sign (CTS) and Belgian Traffic Sign (BTS) datasets. The proposed model shows excellent recognition performance with an accuracy of up to 97.64%, making it one of the best performing BNN models in the GTSRB dataset. Compared with the full-precision model, the accuracy loss is controlled within 1%, and the parameter storage overhead of the model is only 10% of that of the full-precision model. More importantly, our network model only relies on logical operations and low-bit width fixed-point addition and subtraction operations during the inference phase, which greatly simplifies the design complexity of the processing element (PE). Our research shows the great potential of BNN in the hardware deployment of computer vision models, especially in the field of computer vision tasks related to autonomous driving.</p></details> |  |
| **[HgPCN: A Heterogeneous Architecture for E2E Embedded Point Cloud Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07767v1)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Point cloud is an important type of geometric data structure for many embedded applications such as autonomous driving and augmented reality. Current Point Cloud Networks (PCNs) have proven to achieve great success in using inference to perform point cloud analysis, including object part segmentation, shape classification, and so on. However, point cloud applications on the computing edge require more than just the inference step. They require an end-to-end (E2E) processing of the point cloud workloads: pre-processing of raw data, input preparation, and inference to perform point cloud analysis. Current PCN approaches to support end-to-end processing of point cloud workload cannot meet the real-time latency requirement on the edge, i.e., the ability of the AI service to keep up with the speed of raw data generation by 3D sensors. Latency for end-to-end processing of the point cloud workloads stems from two reasons: memory-intensive down-sampling in the pre-processing phase and the data structuring step for input preparation in the inference phase. In this paper, we present HgPCN, an end-to-end heterogeneous architecture for real-time embedded point cloud applications. In HgPCN, we introduce two novel methodologies based on spatial indexing to address the two identified bottlenecks. In the Pre-processing Engine of HgPCN, an Octree-Indexed-Sampling method is used to optimize the memory-intensive down-sampling bottleneck of the pre-processing phase. In the Inference Engine, HgPCN extends a commercial DLA with a customized Data Structuring Unit which is based on a Voxel-Expanded Gathering method to fundamentally reduce the workload of the data structuring step in the inference phase.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by MICRO2024</p></details> |

We refer to this problem as task concept learning and present our approach, Few-Shot Task Learning through Inverse Generative Modeling (FTL-IGM), which learns new task concepts by leveraging invertible neural generative models. The core idea is to pretrain a generative model on a set of basic concepts and their demonstrations. Then, given a few demonstrations of a new concept (such as a new goal or a new action), our method learns the underlying concepts through backpropagation without updating the model weights, thanks to the invertibility of the generative model. We evaluate our method in five domains -- object rearrangement, goal-oriented navigation, motion caption of human actions, autonomous driving, and real-world table-top manipulation. Our experimental results demonstrate that via the pretrained generative model, we successfully learn novel concepts and generate agent plans or motion corresponding to these concepts in (1) unseen environments and (2) in composition with training concepts.</p></details> | Added acknowledgment |
| **[LDMapNet-U: An End-to-End System for City-Scale Lane-Level Map Updating](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02763v2)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An up-to-date city-scale lane-level map is an indispensable infrastructure and a key enabling technology for ensuring the safety and user experience of autonomous driving systems. In industrial scenarios, reliance on manual annotation for map updates creates a critical bottleneck. Lane-level updates require precise change information and must ensure consistency with adjacent data while adhering to strict standards. Traditional methods utilize a three-stage approach-construction, change detection, and updating-which often necessitates manual verification due to accuracy limitations. This results in labor-intensive processes and hampers timely updates. To address these challenges, we propose LDMapNet-U, which implements a new end-to-end paradigm for city-scale lane-level map updating. By reconceptualizing the update task as an end-to-end map generation process grounded in historical map data, we introduce a paradigm shift in map updating that simultaneously generates vectorized maps and change information. To achieve this, a Prior-Map Encoding (PME) module is introduced to effectively encode historical maps, serving as a critical reference for detecting changes. Additionally, we incorporate a novel Instance Change Prediction (ICP) module that learns to predict associations with historical maps. Consequently, LDMapNet-U simultaneously achieves vectorized map element generation and change detection. To demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of LDMapNet-U, extensive experiments are conducted using large-scale real-world datasets. In addition, LDMapNet-U has been successfully deployed in production at Baidu Maps since April 2024, supporting map updating for over 360 cities and significantly shortening the update cycle from quarterly to weekly. The updated maps serve hundreds of millions of users and are integrated into the autonomous driving systems of several leading vehicle companies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by KDD 2025, camera-ready version</p></details> |

Recent hybrid MLLMs incorporate a mixture of vision experts to address the limitations of using a single vision encoder and excessively long visual tokens. Despite the progress of these MLLMs, a research gap remains in effectively integrating diverse vision encoders. This work explores fusion strategies of visual tokens for hybrid MLLMs, leading to the design of LEO, a novel MLLM with a dual-branch vision encoder framework that incorporates a post-adaptation fusion strategy and adaptive tiling: for each segmented tile of the input images, LEO sequentially interleaves the visual tokens from its two vision encoders. Extensive evaluation across 13 vision-language benchmarks reveals that LEO outperforms state-of-the-art open-source MLLMs and hybrid MLLMs on the majority of tasks. Furthermore, we show that LEO can be adapted to the specialized domain of autonomous driving without altering the model architecture or training recipe, achieving competitive performance compared to existing baselines. The code and model will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |

However, many challenges remain, e.g. semantic understanding of pedestrians' behaviors, and downstream handling for pedestrian interactions. Recent studies in applications of Large Language Models (LLM) and Vision-Language Models (VLM) have achieved promising results in scene understanding and high-level maneuver planning in diverse traffic scenarios. However, deploying the billion-parameter LLMs to vehicles requires significant computation and memory resources. In this paper, we analyzed effective knowledge distillation of semantic labels to smaller Vision networks, which can be used for the semantic representation of complex scenes for downstream decision-making for planning and control.</p></details> |  |
| **[Common Sense Is All You Need](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06642v1)** | 2025-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial intelligence (AI) has made significant strides in recent years, yet it continues to struggle with a fundamental aspect of cognition present in all animals: common sense. Current AI systems, including those designed for complex tasks like autonomous driving, problem-solving challenges such as the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), and conversational benchmarks like the Turing Test, often lack the ability to adapt to new situations without extensive prior knowledge. This manuscript argues that integrating common sense into AI systems is essential for achieving true autonomy and unlocking the full societal and commercial value of AI. We propose a shift in the order of knowledge acquisition emphasizing the importance of developing AI systems that start from minimal prior knowledge and are capable of contextual learning, adaptive reasoning, and embodiment -- even within abstract domains. Additionally, we highlight the need to rethink the AI software stack to address this foundational challenge. Without common sense, AI systems may never reach true autonomy, instead exhibiting asymptotic performance that approaches theoretical ideals like AIXI but remains unattainable in practice due to infinite resource and computation requirements. While scaling AI models and passing benchmarks like the Turing Test have brought significant advancements in applications that do not require autonomy, these approaches alone are insufficient to achieve autonomous AI with common sense. By redefining existing benchmarks and challenges to enforce constraints that require genuine common sense, and by broadening our understanding of embodiment to include both physical and abstract domains, we can encourage the development of AI systems better equipped to handle the complexities of real-world and abstract environments.</p></details> |  |

The proposed framework is designed to 1. maximize the traffic flow and 2. minimize collisions by controlling the vehicle's motion dynamics (i.e., speed and acceleration), and enhance the ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) while minimizing handoffs (HOs). We cast this problem as a multi-objective Markov Decision Process (MOMDP) and develop solutions for both predefined and unknown preferences of the conflicting objectives. Specifically, deep-Q-network and double deep-Q-network-based solutions are developed first that consider scalarizing the transportation and telecommunication rewards using predefined preferences. We then develop a novel envelope MORL solution which develop policies that address multiple objectives with unknown preferences to the agent. While this approach reduces reliance on scalar rewards, policy effectiveness varying with different preferences is a challenge. To address this, we apply a generalized version of the Bellman equation and optimize the convex envelope of multi-objective Q values to learn a unified parametric representation capable of generating optimal policies across all possible preference configurations. Following an initial learning phase, our agent can execute optimal policies under any specified preference or infer preferences from minimal data samples.Numerical results validate the efficacy of the envelope-based MORL solution and demonstrate interesting insights related to the inter-dependency of vehicle motion dynamics, HOs, and the communication data rate. The proposed policies enable autonomous vehicles to adopt safe driving behaviors with improved connectivity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submission for possible publication</p></details> |

Continuation of development during public road deployment forces other road users including vulnerable ones to involuntarily participate in the development process, leading to safety risks, inefficiencies, and a decline in public trust. To address these deficiencies, the Vehicle-in-Virtual-Environment (VVE) method was proposed as a safer, more efficient, and cost-effective solution for developing and testing connected and autonomous driving technologies by operating the real vehicle and multiple other actors like vulnerable road users in different test areas while being immersed within the same highly realistic virtual environment. This VVE approach synchronizes real-world vehicle and vulnerable road user motion within the same virtual scenario, enabling the safe and realistic testing of various traffic situations in a safe and repeatable manner. In this paper, we propose a new testing pipeline that sequentially integrates MIL, HIL, and VVE methods to comprehensively develop and evaluate autonomous driving functions. The effectiveness of this testing pipeline will be demonstrated using an autonomous driving path-tracking algorithm with local deep reinforcement learning modification for vulnerable road user collision avoidance.</p></details> |  |

However, the performance of these systems can be significantly compromised by the occlusion on sensors due to environmental factors like dirt, dust, rain, and fog. These occlusions severely affect vision-based tasks such as object detection, vehicle segmentation, and lane recognition. In this paper, we investigate the impact of various kinds of occlusions on camera sensor by projecting their effects from multi-view camera images of the nuScenes dataset into the Bird's-Eye View (BEV) domain. This approach allows us to analyze how occlusions spatially distribute and influence vehicle segmentation accuracy within the BEV domain. Despite significant advances in sensor technology and multi-sensor fusion, a gap remains in the existing literature regarding the specific effects of camera occlusions on BEV-based perception systems. To address this gap, we use a multi-sensor fusion technique that integrates LiDAR and radar sensor data to mitigate the performance degradation caused by occluded cameras. Our findings demonstrate that this approach significantly enhances the accuracy and robustness of vehicle segmentation tasks, leading to more reliable autonomous driving systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted form publishing at the Electronic Imaging - Autonomous Vehicles and Machines Conference</p></details> |

Existing methods usually employ neural radiance fields to produce voxelized 3D occupancy, lacking instance-level semantic reasoning and temporal photometric consistency. In this paper, we propose ViPOcc, which leverages the visual priors from vision foundation models (VFMs) for fine-grained 3D occupancy prediction. Unlike previous works that solely employ volume rendering for RGB and depth image reconstruction, we introduce a metric depth estimation branch, in which an inverse depth alignment module is proposed to bridge the domain gap in depth distribution between VFM predictions and the ground truth. The recovered metric depth is then utilized in temporal photometric alignment and spatial geometric alignment to ensure accurate and consistent 3D occupancy prediction. Additionally, we also propose a semantic-guided non-overlapping Gaussian mixture sampler for efficient, instance-aware ray sampling, which addresses the redundant and imbalanced sampling issue that still exists in previous state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of ViPOcc in both 3D occupancy prediction and depth estimation tasks on the KITTI-360 and KITTI Raw datasets.

This study addresses these issues by proposing TB-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs on understanding traffic behaviors across eight perception tasks from ego-centric views. We also introduce vision-language instruction tuning datasets, TB-100k and TB-250k, along with simple yet effective baselines for the tasks. Through extensive experiments, we show that existing MLLMs underperform in these tasks, with even a powerful model like GPT-4o achieving less than 35% accuracy on average. In contrast, when fine-tuned with TB-100k or TB-250k, our baseline models achieve average accuracy up to 85%, significantly enhancing performance on the tasks. Additionally, we demonstrate performance transfer by co-training TB-100k with another traffic dataset, leading to improved performance on the latter. Overall, this study represents a step forward by introducing a comprehensive benchmark, high-quality datasets, and baselines, thus supporting the gradual integration of MLLMs into the perception, prediction, and planning stages of AD.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main Paper: 8 pages, Supplementary Materials: 15 pages</p></details> |

This study developed a dynamic scene retrieval system using Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) models, which can be optimized for real-time deployment on edge devices. The proposed system outperforms state-of-the-art in-context learning methods, including the zero-shot capabilities of GPT-4o, particularly in complex scenarios. By conducting frame-level analysis on the Honda Scenes Dataset, which contains a collection of about 80 hours of annotated driving videos capturing diverse real-world road and weather conditions, our study highlights the robustness of CLIP models in learning visual concepts from natural language supervision. Results also showed that fine-tuning the CLIP models, such as ViT-L/14 and ViT-B/32, significantly improved scene classification, achieving a top F1 score of 91.1%. These results demonstrate the ability of the system to deliver rapid and precise scene recognition, which can be used to meet the critical requirements of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). This study shows the potential of CLIP models to provide scalable and efficient frameworks for dynamic scene understanding and classification. Furthermore, this work lays the groundwork for advanced autonomous vehicle technologies by fostering a deeper understanding of driver behavior, road conditions, and safety-critical scenarios, marking a significant step toward smarter, safer, and more context-aware autonomous driving systems.</p></details> |  |

While promising approaches exist, they often revolve around pedestrian datasets excluding traffic-related information, or resemble architectures that are either not real-time capable or robust. To address these limitations, we first introduce a dedicated benchmark based on Argoverse 2, specifically targeting pedestrians in traffic environments. Following this, we present Snapshot, a modular, feed-forward neural network that outperforms the current state of the art, reducing the Average Displacement Error (ADE) by 8.8% while utilizing significantly less information. Despite its agent-centric encoding scheme, Snapshot demonstrates scalability, real-time performance, and robustness to varying motion histories. Moreover, by integrating Snapshot into a modular autonomous driving software stack, we showcase its real-world applicability.</p></details> | 8 Pages, 9 Figures |

While human drivers do this intuitively, autonomous vehicles allow and require deliberative algorithmic risk management. But how should traffic risks be distributed among road users? In a global experimental study in eight countries with different cultural backgrounds and almost 11,000 participants, we compared risk distribution preferences. It turns out that risk preferences in road traffic are strikingly similar between the cultural zones. The vast majority of participants in all countries deviates from a guiding principle of minimizing accident probabilities in favor of weighing up the probability and severity of accidents. At the national level, the consideration of accident probability and severity hardly differs between countries. The social dilemma of autonomous vehicles detected in deterministic crash scenarios disappears in risk assessments of everyday traffic situations in all countries. In no country do cyclists receive a risk bonus that goes beyond their higher vulnerability. In sum, our results suggest that a global consensus on the risk ethics of autonomous driving is easier to establish than on the ethics of crashing.</p></details> |  |

Telemetry-based applications typically source speed data from the On-Board Diagnostic II (OBD-II) system. However, the method of deriving speed, as well as the types of sensors used to measure wheel speed, differs across vehicles. These differences result in varying error characteristics that must be accounted for in navigation and autonomy applications. This paper addresses this gap by examining the diverse speed-sensing technologies employed in standard automotive systems and alternative techniques used in advanced systems designed for higher levels of autonomy, such as Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), Autonomous Driving (AD), or surveying applications. We propose a method to identify the type of speed sensor in a vehicle and present strategies for accurately modeling its error characteristics. To validate our approach, we collected and analyzed data from three long real road trajectories conducted in urban environments in Toronto and Kingston, Ontario, Canada. The results underscore the critical role of integrating multiple sensor modalities to achieve more accurate speed estimation, thus improving automotive navigation state estimation, particularly in GNSS-denied environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 12 figures, to be published in conference proceedings</p></details> |

Standard models trained on data recorded under ideal conditions show a deteriorated performance in unfavorable weather or illumination conditions. Fine-tuning on the new task or condition would lead to overwriting the previously learned information resulting in catastrophic forgetting. Adapting to the new conditions through traditional domain adaption methods improves the performance on the target domain at the expense of the source domain. Addressing these issues, we propose an architecture-based domain-incremental learning approach called Progressive Semantic Segmentation (PSS). PSS is a task-agnostic, dynamically growing collection of domain-specific segmentation models. The task of inferring the domain and subsequently selecting the appropriate module for segmentation is carried out using a collection of convolutional autoencoders. We extensively evaluate our proposed approach using several datasets at varying levels of granularity in the categorization of adverse driving conditions. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generalization of the proposed approach to similar and unseen domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICPRAM 2025</p></details> |
| **[RA-PbRL: Provably Efficient Risk-Aware Preference-Based Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23569v4)** | 2025-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has recently surged in popularity, particularly for aligning large language models and other AI systems with human intentions. At its core, RLHF can be viewed as a specialized instance of Preference-based Reinforcement Learning (PbRL), where the preferences specifically originate from human judgments rather than arbitrary evaluators. Despite this connection, most existing approaches in both RLHF and PbRL primarily focus on optimizing a mean reward objective, neglecting scenarios that necessitate risk-awareness, such as AI safety, healthcare, and autonomous driving. These scenarios often operate under a one-episode-reward setting, which makes conventional risk-sensitive objectives inapplicable. To address this, we explore and prove the applicability of two risk-aware objectives to PbRL : nested and static quantile risk objectives. We also introduce Risk-AwarePbRL (RA-PbRL), an algorithm designed to optimize both nested and static objectives. Additionally, we provide a theoretical analysis of the regret upper bounds, demonstrating that they are sublinear with respect to the number of episodes, and present empirical results to support our findings. Our code is available in https://github.com/aguilarjose11/PbRLNeurips.</p></details> |  |
| **[CorrDiff: Adaptive Delay-aware Detector with Temporal Cue Inputs for Real-time Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05132v1)** | 2025-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time object detection takes an essential part in the decision-making process of numerous real-world applications, including collision avoidance and path planning in autonomous driving systems. This paper presents a novel real-time streaming perception method named CorrDiff, designed to tackle the challenge of delays in real-time detection systems. The main contribution of CorrDiff lies in its adaptive delay-aware detector, which is able to utilize runtime-estimated temporal cues to predict objects' locations for multiple future frames, and selectively produce predictions that matches real-world time, effectively compensating for any communication and computational delays. The proposed model outperforms current state-of-the-art methods by leveraging motion estimation and feature enhancement, both for 1) single-frame detection for the current frame or the next frame, in terms of the metric mAP, and 2) the prediction for (multiple) future frame(s), in terms of the metric sAP (The sAP metric is to evaluate object detection algorithms in streaming scenarios, factoring in both latency and accuracy). It demonstrates robust performance across a range of devices, from powerful Tesla V100 to modest RTX 2080Ti, achieving the highest level of perceptual accuracy on all platforms. Unlike most state-of-the-art methods that struggle to complete computation within a single frame on less powerful devices, CorrDiff meets the stringent real-time processing requirements on all kinds of devices. The experimental results emphasize the system's adaptability and its potential to significantly improve the safety and reliability for many real-world systems, such as autonomous driving. Our code is completely open-sourced and is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CorrDiff.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE JSAC Special Issue: Intelligent Communications for Real-Time Computer Vision (Comm4CV)</p></details> |

In particular, multimodal large language models (MLLM) can combine multiple modalities such as pictures, videos, sounds, texts, etc., and have great potential in various tasks. However, most MLLMs require very high computational resources, which is a major challenge for most researchers and developers. In this paper, we explored the utility of small-scale MLLMs and applied small-scale MLLMs to the field of autonomous driving. We hope that this will advance the application of MLLMs in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[LearningFlow: Automated Policy Learning Workflow for Urban Driving with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05057v1)** | 2025-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in reinforcement learning (RL) demonstrate the significant potential in autonomous driving. Despite this promise, challenges such as the manual design of reward functions and low sample efficiency in complex environments continue to impede the development of safe and effective driving policies. To tackle these issues, we introduce LearningFlow, an innovative automated policy learning workflow tailored to urban driving. This framework leverages the collaboration of multiple large language model (LLM) agents throughout the RL training process. LearningFlow includes a curriculum sequence generation process and a reward generation process, which work in tandem to guide the RL policy by generating tailored training curricula and reward functions. Particularly, each process is supported by an analysis agent that evaluates training progress and provides critical insights to the generation agent. Through the collaborative efforts of these LLM agents, LearningFlow automates policy learning across a series of complex driving tasks, and it significantly reduces the reliance on manual reward function design while enhancing sample efficiency. Comprehensive experiments are conducted in the high-fidelity CARLA simulator, along with comparisons with other existing methods, to demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed approach. The results demonstrate that LearningFlow excels in generating rewards and curricula. It also achieves superior performance and robust generalization across various driving tasks, as well as commendable adaptation to different RL algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalizable Autonomous Driving System across Diverse Adverse Weather Conditions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14737v3)** | 2025-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Various adverse weather conditions pose a significant challenge to autonomous driving (AD) street scene semantic understanding (segmentation). A common strategy is to minimize the disparity between images captured in clear and adverse weather conditions. However, this technique typically relies on utilizing clear image as a reference, which is challenging to obtain in practice. Furthermore, this method typically targets a single adverse condition, and thus perform poorly when confronting a mixture of multiple adverse weather conditions. To address these issues, we introduce a reference-free and Adverse weather-Immune scheme (called AdvImmu) that leverages the invariance of weather conditions over short periods (seconds). Specifically, AdvImmu includes three components: Locally Sequential Mechanism (LSM), Globally Shuffled Mechanism (GSM), and Unfolded Regularizers (URs). LSM leverages temporal correlations between adjacent frames to enhance model performance. GSM is proposed to shuffle LSM segments to prevent overfitting of temporal patterns. URs are the deep unfolding implementation of two proposed regularizers to penalize the model complexity to enhance across-weather generalization. In addition, to overcome the over-reliance on consecutive frame-wise annotations in the training of AdvImmu (typically unavailable in AD scenarios), we incorporate a foundation model named Segment Anything Model (SAM) to assist to annotate frames, and additionally propose a cluster algorithm (denoted as SBICAC) to surmount SAM's category-agnostic issue to generate pseudo-labels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed AdvImmu outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by 88.56% in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU).</p></details> | 16 Pages |

Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agents address this by learning from experience and maximizing rewards, which helps them adapt to dynamic environments. However, ensuring their generalization remains challenging, especially with static training environments. Additionally, DRL models lack transparency, making it difficult to guarantee safety in all scenarios, particularly those not seen during training. To tackle these issues, we propose a method that combines DRL with Curriculum Learning for autonomous driving. Our approach uses a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent and a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to learn safe driving in the CARLA simulator. The agent is trained using two-fold curriculum learning, progressively increasing environment difficulty and incorporating a collision penalty in the reward function to promote safety. This method improves the agent's adaptability and reliability in complex environments, and understand the nuances of balancing multiple reward components from different feedback signals in a single scalar reward function.

Recently, world models have been proposed to simultaneously enhance autonomous driving capabilities by improving the way these systems understand complex real-world environments and reduce their data demands via self-supervised pre-training. In this paper, we present AD-L-JEPA (aka Autonomous Driving with LiDAR data via a Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture), a novel self-supervised pre-training framework for autonomous driving with LiDAR data that, as opposed to existing methods, is neither generative nor contrastive. Our method learns spatial world models with a joint embedding predictive architecture. Instead of explicitly generating masked unknown regions, our self-supervised world models predict Bird's Eye View (BEV) embeddings to represent the diverse nature of autonomous driving scenes. Our approach furthermore eliminates the need to manually create positive and negative pairs, as is the case in contrastive learning. AD-L-JEPA leads to simpler implementation and enhanced learned representations. We qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrate high-quality of embeddings learned with AD-L-JEPA. We furthermore evaluate the accuracy and label efficiency of AD-L-JEPA on popular downstream tasks such as LiDAR 3D object detection and associated transfer learning. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that AD-L-JEPA is a plausible approach for self-supervised pre-training in autonomous driving applications and is the best available approach outperforming SOTA, including most recently proposed Occupancy-MAE [1] and ALSO [2].

An accident can appear in a wide variety of forms, and understanding what type of accident is taking place may be useful to prevent it from recurring. This work focuses on classifying traffic scenes into specific accident types. We approach the problem by representing a traffic scene as a graph, where objects such as cars can be represented as nodes, and relative distances and directions between them as edges. This representation of a traffic scene is referred to as a scene graph, and can be used as input for an accident classifier. Better results are obtained with a classifier that fuses the scene graph input with visual and textual representations. This work introduces a multi-stage, multimodal pipeline that pre-processes videos of traffic accidents, encodes them as scene graphs, and aligns this representation with vision and language modalities before executing the classification task. When trained on 4 classes, our method achieves a balanced accuracy score of 57.77% on an (unbalanced) subset of the popular Detection of Traffic Anomaly (DoTA) benchmark, representing an increase of close to 5 percentage points from the case where scene graph information is not taken into account.</p></details> | <details><summary>Won t...</summary><p>Won the 'Best Paper Runner-up Award' at the 2024 IEEE International Automated Vehicle Validation Conference (IAVVC 2024).

However, multimodal detectors suffer from dimension mismatches that derive from fusing 3D points with 2D pixels coarsely, which leads to sub-optimal fusion performance. In this paper, we propose a multimodal framework FGU3R to tackle the issue mentioned above via unified 3D representation and fine-grained fusion, which consists of two important components. First, we propose an efficient feature extractor for raw and pseudo points, termed Pseudo-Raw Convolution (PRConv), which modulates multimodal features synchronously and aggregates the features from different types of points on key points based on multimodal interaction. Second, a Cross-Attention Adaptive Fusion (CAAF) is designed to fuse homogeneous 3D RoI (Region of Interest) features adaptively via a cross-attention variant in a fine-grained manner. Together they make fine-grained fusion on unified 3D representation.

To maintain temporal consistency, large-size instances detected in the current frame are compared and associated with instances within a temporal window that includes the current and preceding frames. However, their reliance on short-term instance detection, lack of motion estimation, and exclusion of small-sized instances lead to frequent identity switches and reduced tracking performance. We address these issues with the NextStop1 tracker, which integrates Kalman filter-based motion estimation, data association, and lifespan management, along with a tracklet state concept to improve prioritization. Evaluated using the LiDAR Segmentation and Tracking Quality (LSTQ) metric on the SemanticKITTI validation set, NextStop demonstrated enhanced tracking performance, particularly for small-sized objects like people and bicyclists, with fewer ID switches, earlier tracking initiation, and improved reliability in complex environments.

| **[H-MBA: Hierarchical MamBa Adaptation for Multi-Modal Video Understanding in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04302v1)** | 2025-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the prevalence of Multimodal Large Language Models(MLLMs), autonomous driving has encountered new opportunities and challenges. In particular, multi-modal video understanding is critical to interactively analyze what will happen in the procedure of autonomous driving. However, videos in such a dynamical scene that often contains complex spatial-temporal movements, which restricts the generalization capacity of the existing MLLMs in this field. To bridge the gap, we propose a novel Hierarchical Mamba Adaptation (H-MBA) framework to fit the complicated motion changes in autonomous driving videos. Specifically, our H-MBA consists of two distinct modules, including Context Mamba (C-Mamba) and Query Mamba (Q-Mamba). First, C-Mamba contains various types of structure state space models, which can effectively capture multi-granularity video context for different temporal resolutions. Second, Q-Mamba flexibly transforms the current frame as the learnable query, and attentively selects multi-granularity video context into query. Consequently, it can adaptively integrate all the video contexts of multi-scale temporal resolutions to enhance video understanding. Via a plug-and-play paradigm in MLLMs, our H-MBA shows the remarkable performance on multi-modal video tasks in autonomous driving, e.g., for risk object detection, it outperforms the previous SOTA method with 5.5% mIoU improvement.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Motion Dreamer: Realizing Physically Coherent Video Generation through Scene-Aware Motion Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00547v2)** | 2025-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent numerous video generation models, also known as world models, have demonstrated the ability to generate plausible real-world videos. However, many studies have shown that these models often produce motion results lacking logical or physical coherence. In this paper, we revisit video generation models and find that single-stage approaches struggle to produce high-quality results while maintaining coherent motion reasoning. To address this issue, we propose \textbf{Motion Dreamer}, a two-stage video generation framework. In Stage I, the model generates an intermediate motion representation-such as a segmentation map or depth map-based on the input image and motion conditions, focusing solely on the motion itself. In Stage II, the model uses this intermediate motion representation as a condition to generate a high-detail video. By decoupling motion reasoning from high-fidelity video synthesis, our approach allows for more accurate and physically plausible motion generation. We validate the effectiveness of our approach on the Physion dataset and in autonomous driving scenarios. For example, given a single push, our model can synthesize the sequential toppling of a set of dominoes. Similarly, by varying the movements of ego-cars, our model can produce different effects on other vehicles. Our work opens new avenues in creating models that can reason about physical interactions in a more coherent and realistic manner.

In this paper, we introduce LargeAD, a versatile and scalable framework designed for large-scale 3D pretraining across diverse real-world driving datasets. Our framework leverages VFMs to extract semantically rich superpixels from 2D images, which are aligned with LiDAR point clouds to generate high-quality contrastive samples. This alignment facilitates cross-modal representation learning, enhancing the semantic consistency between 2D and 3D data. We introduce several key innovations: i) VFM-driven superpixel generation for detailed semantic representation, ii) a VFM-assisted contrastive learning strategy to align multimodal features, iii) superpoint temporal consistency to maintain stable representations across time, and iv) multi-source data pretraining to generalize across various LiDAR configurations. Our approach delivers significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods in both linear probing and fine-tuning tasks for both LiDAR-based segmentation and object detection.

However, the assumption that VLMs inherently provide visually grounded, reliable, and interpretable explanations for driving remains largely unexamined. To address this gap, we introduce DriveBench, a benchmark dataset designed to evaluate VLM reliability across 17 settings (clean, corrupted, and text-only inputs), encompassing 19,200 frames, 20,498 question-answer pairs, three question types, four mainstream driving tasks, and a total of 12 popular VLMs. Our findings reveal that VLMs often generate plausible responses derived from general knowledge or textual cues rather than true visual grounding, especially under degraded or missing visual inputs. This behavior, concealed by dataset imbalances and insufficient evaluation metrics, poses significant risks in safety-critical scenarios like autonomous driving. We further observe that VLMs struggle with multi-modal reasoning and display heightened sensitivity to input corruptions, leading to inconsistencies in performance. To address these challenges, we propose refined evaluation metrics that prioritize robust visual grounding and multi-modal understanding. Additionally, we highlight the potential of leveraging VLMs' awareness of corruptions to enhance their reliability, offering a roadmap for developing more trustworthy and interpretable decision-making systems in real-world autonomous driving contexts.

Although end-to-end models based on deep learning have great potential, they often do not consider vehicle dynamic limitations, leading to unrealistic predictions. To address this problem, this work introduces a novel hybrid model that combines deep learning with a kinematic motion model. It is able to predict object attributes such as acceleration and yaw rate and generate trajectories based on them. A key contribution is the incorporation of expert knowledge into the learning objective of the deep learning model. This results in the constraint of the available action space, thus enabling the prediction of physically feasible object attributes and trajectories, thereby increasing safety and robustness. The proposed hybrid model facilitates enhanced interpretability, thereby reinforcing the trustworthiness of deep learning methods and promoting the development of safe planning solutions.

| **[Siamese-DETR for Generic Multi-Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17875v3)** | 2025-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to detect and track the dynamic objects in different scenes is fundamental to real-world applications, e.g., autonomous driving and robot navigation. However, traditional Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) is limited to tracking objects belonging to the pre-defined closed-set categories. Recently, Open-Vocabulary MOT (OVMOT) and Generic MOT (GMOT) are proposed to track interested objects beyond pre-defined categories with the given text prompt and template image. However, the expensive well pre-trained (vision-)language model and fine-grained category annotations are required to train OVMOT models. In this paper, we focus on GMOT and propose a simple but effective method, Siamese-DETR, for GMOT. Only the commonly used detection datasets (e.g., COCO) are required for training. Different from existing GMOT methods, which train a Single Object Tracking (SOT) based detector to detect interested objects and then apply a data association based MOT tracker to get the trajectories, we leverage the inherent object queries in DETR variants. Specifically: 1) The multi-scale object queries are designed based on the given template image, which are effective for detecting different scales of objects with the same category as the template image; 2) A dynamic matching training strategy is introduced to train Siamese-DETR on commonly used detection datasets, which takes full advantage of provided annotations; 3) The online tracking pipeline is simplified through a tracking-by-query manner by incorporating the tracked boxes in previous frame as additional query boxes. The complex data association is replaced with the much simpler Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS). Extensive experimental results show that Siamese-DETR surpasses existing MOT methods on GMOT-40 dataset by a large margin.

Methods based on synthetic data are gaining prominence due to the cost and complexity of gathering real-world data but require a high degree of realism and controllability in order to be useful. This paper introduces MObI, a novel framework for Multimodal Object Inpainting that leverages a diffusion model to create realistic and controllable object inpaintings across perceptual modalities, demonstrated for both camera and lidar simultaneously. Using a single reference RGB image, MObI enables objects to be seamlessly inserted into existing multimodal scenes at a 3D location specified by a bounding box, while maintaining semantic consistency and multimodal coherence. Unlike traditional inpainting methods that rely solely on edit masks, our 3D bounding box conditioning gives objects accurate spatial positioning and realistic scaling. As a result, our approach can be used to insert novel objects flexibly into multimodal scenes, providing significant advantages for testing perception models.</p></details> | 8 pages |

| **[4D-CS: Exploiting Cluster Prior for 4D Spatio-Temporal LiDAR Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02937v1)** | 2025-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation of LiDAR points has significant value for autonomous driving and mobile robot systems. Most approaches explore spatio-temporal information of multi-scan to identify the semantic classes and motion states for each point. However, these methods often overlook the segmentation consistency in space and time, which may result in point clouds within the same object being predicted as different categories. To handle this issue, our core idea is to generate cluster labels across multiple frames that can reflect the complete spatial structure and temporal information of objects. These labels serve as explicit guidance for our dual-branch network, 4D-CS, which integrates point-based and cluster-based branches to enable more consistent segmentation. Specifically, in the point-based branch, we leverage historical knowledge to enrich the current feature through temporal fusion on multiple views. In the cluster-based branch, we propose a new strategy to produce cluster labels of foreground objects and apply them to gather point-wise information to derive cluster features. We then merge neighboring clusters across multiple scans to restore missing features due to occlusion. Finally, in the point-cluster fusion stage, we adaptively fuse the information from the two branches to optimize segmentation results. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method, and we achieve state-of-the-art results on the multi-scan semantic and moving object segmentation on SemanticKITTI and nuScenes datasets. The code will be available at https://github.com/NEU-REAL/4D-CS.git.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RAL)</p></details> |

Building on the methodology of visual transformers that exploit the self-attention mechanism, we extend segmentation capabilities with additional classification options to a diverse class of objects including cyclists, traffic signs, and pedestrians across diverse weather conditions. Despite good performance, the models face challenges under adverse conditions which underscores the need for further optimization to enhance performance in darkness and rain. In summary, the CLFT models offer a compelling solution for autonomous driving perception, advancing the state-of-the-art in multimodal fusion and object segmentation, with ongoing efforts required to address existing limitations and fully harness their potential in practical deployments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on Agents and Artificial Intelligence 2025</p></details> |

We propose utilizing LLMs to generate both contextually canonical phrases and helping positive words for enhanced segmentation and scene interpretation. Our method leverages GPT-3.5 Turbo as an expert model to create a high-quality text dataset, which we then use to fine-tune smaller, more efficient LLMs for on-device deployment. Our comprehensive evaluation on the WayveScenes101 dataset demonstrates that LLM-guided segmentation significantly outperforms traditional approaches based on predefined canonical phrases. Notably, our fine-tuned smaller models achieve performance comparable to larger expert models while maintaining faster inference times. Through ablation studies, we discover that the effectiveness of helping positive words correlates with model scale, with larger models better equipped to leverage additional semantic information. This work represents a significant advancement towards more efficient, context-aware autonomous driving systems, effectively bridging 3D scene representation with high-level semantic querying while maintaining practical deployment considerations.</p></details> |  |

We start by reviewing the conventional Kalman filtering-based state estimation algorithm, which typically relies on perfect CSI and incurs considerable computational complexity. To overcome the need for CSI, we introduce a novel semantic aggregation method, in which sensors transmit semantic measurement discrepancies to the remote state estimator through analog aggregation. To further reduce computational complexity, we introduce a constant-gain-based filtering algorithm that can be optimized offline using the constrained stochastic successive convex approximation (CSSCA) method. We derive a closed-form sufficient condition for the estimation stability of our proposed scheme via Lyapunov drift analysis. Numerical results showcase significant performance gains using the proposed scheme compared to several widely used methods.</p></details> |  |

This comprises characterizations of hidden Markov models in terms of conditional independences and algorithms for Bayesian filtering and smoothing applicable in all Markov categories with conditionals. When instantiated in appropriate Markov categories, these algorithms specialize to existing ones such as the Kalman filter, forward-backward algorithm, and the Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoother. We also prove that the sequence of outputs of our abstract Bayes filter is itself a Markov chain with a concrete formula for its transition maps. There are two main features of this categorical framework. The first is its abstract generality, as manifested in our unified account of hidden Markov models and algorithms for filtering and smoothing in discrete probability, Gaussian probability, measure-theoretic probability, possibilistic nondeterminism and others at the same time. The second feature is the intuitive visual representation of information flow in terms of string diagrams.</p></details> | <details><summary>v3: s...</summary><p>v3: shortened to 55 pages</p></details> |

It integrates a degeneration-aware adaptive visual frame selector into error-state iterated Kalman filter (ESIKF) with sequential updates, improving computation efficiency significantly while maintaining a similar level of robustness. Additionally, a memory-efficient mapping structure combining a locally unified visual-LiDAR map and a long-term visual map achieves a good trade-off between performance and memory usage. Extensive experiments on x86 and ARM platforms demonstrate the system's robustness and efficiency. On the Hilti dataset, our system achieves a 33% reduction in per-frame runtime and 47% lower memory usage compared to FAST-LIVO2, with only a 3 cm increase in RMSE. Despite this slight accuracy trade-off, our system remains competitive, outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) LIO methods such as FAST-LIO2 and most existing LIVO systems. These results validate the system's capability for scalable deployment on resource-constrained edge computing platforms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Communication-Efficient Distributed Kalman Filtering using ADMM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13003v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the problem of optimal linear filtering in a network of local estimators, commonly referred to as distributed Kalman filtering (DKF). The DKF problem is formulated within a distributed optimization framework, where coupling constraints require the exchange of local state and covariance updates between neighboring nodes to achieve consensus. To address these constraints, the problem is transformed into an unconstrained optimization form using the augmented Lagrangian method. The distributed alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is then applied to derive update steps that achieve the desired performance while exchanging only the primal variables. Notably, the proposed method enhances communication efficiency by eliminating the need for dual variable exchange. We show that the design parameters depend on the maximum eigenvalue of the network's Laplacian matrix, yielding a significantly tighter bound compared to existing results. A rigorous convergence analysis is provided, proving that the state estimates converge to the true state and that the covariance matrices across all local estimators converge to a globally optimal solution. Numerical results are presented to validate the efficacy of the proposed approach.</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[Robust Data-Driven Kalman Filtering for Unknown Linear Systems using Maximum Likelihood Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18096v2)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates the state estimation problem for unknown linear systems subject to both process and measurement noise. Based on a prior input-output trajectory sampled at a higher frequency and a prior state trajectory sampled at a lower frequency, we propose a novel robust data-driven Kalman filter (RDKF) that integrates model identification with state estimation for the unknown system. Specifically, the state estimation problem is formulated as a non-convex maximum likelihood optimization problem. Then, we slightly modify the optimization problem to get a problem solvable with a recursive algorithm. Based on the optimal solution to this new problem, the RDKF is designed, which can estimate the state of a given but unknown state-space model. The performance gap between the RDKF and the optimal Kalman filter based on known system matrices is quantified through a sample complexity bound. In particular, when the number of the pre-collected states tends to infinity, this gap converges to zero. Finally, the effectiveness of the theoretical results is illustrated by numerical simulations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Orbit-Attitude Predictive Control in the Vicinity of Asteroids with In Situ Gravity Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12830v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents an integrated model-learning predictive control scheme for spacecraft orbit-attitude station-keeping in the vicinity of asteroids. The orbiting probe relies on optical and laser navigation while attitude measurements are provided by star trackers and gyroscopes. The asteroid gravity field inhomogeneities are assumed to be unknown a priori. The state and gravity model parameters are estimated simultaneously using an unscented Kalman filter. The proposed gravity model identification enables the application of a learning-based predictive control methodology. The predictive control allows for a high degree of accuracy because the predicted model is progressively identified in situ. Consequently, the tracking errors decrease over time as the model accuracy increases. Finally, a constellation mission concept is analyzed in order to speed up the model identification process. Numerical results are shown and discussed.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimal Spatial-Temporal Triangulation for Bearing-Only Cooperative Motion Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15846v4)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-based cooperative motion estimation is an important problem for many multi-robot systems such as cooperative aerial target pursuit. This problem can be formulated as bearing-only cooperative motion estimation, where the visual measurement is modeled as a bearing vector pointing from the camera to the target. The conventional approaches for bearing-only cooperative estimation are mainly based on the framework distributed Kalman filtering (DKF). In this paper, we propose a new optimal bearing-only cooperative estimation algorithm, named spatial-temporal triangulation, based on the method of distributed recursive least squares, which provides a more flexible framework for designing distributed estimators than DKF. The design of the algorithm fully incorporates all the available information and the specific triangulation geometric constraint. As a result, the algorithm has superior estimation performance than the state-of-the-art DKF algorithms in terms of both accuracy and convergence speed as verified by numerical simulation. We rigorously prove the exponential convergence of the proposed algorithm. Moreover, to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm under practical challenging conditions, we develop a vision-based cooperative aerial target pursuit system, which is the first of such fully autonomous systems so far to the best of our knowledge.</p></details> |  |

Currently, tracking-by-detection (TBD) is the dominant paradigm for MOT, which performs target detection and association frame by frame. However, the association performance of TBD methods degrades in complex scenes with heavy occlusions, which hinders the application of such methods in real-world scenarios.To this end, we incorporate pseudo-depth cues to enhance the association performance and propose Pseudo-Depth SORT (PD-SORT). First, we extend the Kalman filter state vector with pseudo-depth states. Second, we introduce a novel depth volume IoU (DVIoU) by combining the conventional 2D IoU with pseudo-depth. Furthermore, we develop a quantized pseudo-depth measurement (QPDM) strategy for more robust data association. Besides, we also integrate camera motion compensation (CMC) to handle dynamic camera situations. With the above designs, PD-SORT significantly alleviates the occlusion-induced ambiguous associations and achieves leading performances on DanceTrack, MOT17, and MOT20. Note that the improvement is especially obvious on DanceTrack, where objects show complex motions, similar appearances, and frequent occlusions. The code is available at https://github.com/Wangyc2000/PD_SORT.</p></details> |  |

The lack of instrumental data during this period poses significant challenges to understanding past climate conditions. REACHES digitizes historical documents from the Ming and Qing dynasties of China, converting qualitative descriptions into a four-level ordinal temperature scale. However, these index-based data are biased toward abnormal or extreme weather phenomena, leading to data gaps that likely correspond to normal conditions. To address this bias and reconstruct historical temperatures at any point within East Asia, including locations without direct historical data, we employ a three-tiered statistical framework. First, we perform kriging to interpolate temperature data across East Asia, adopting a zero-mean assumption to handle missing information. Next, we utilize the Last Millennium Ensemble (LME) reanalysis data and apply quantile mapping to calibrate the kriged REACHES data to Celsius temperature scales. Finally, we introduce a novel Bayesian data assimilation method that integrates the kriged Celsius data with LME simulations to enhance reconstruction accuracy. We model the LME data at each geographic location using a flexible nonstationary autoregressive time series model and employ regularized maximum likelihood estimation with a fused lasso penalty. The resulting dynamic distribution serves as a prior, which is refined via Kalman filtering by incorporating the kriged Celsius REACHES data to yield posterior temperature estimates. This comprehensive integration of historical documentation, contemporary climate models, and advanced statistical methods improves the accuracy of historical temperature reconstructions and provides a crucial resource for future environmental and climate studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 16 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

Given the inherent limitations of standalone sensors, integrating heterogeneous sensors with complementary capabilities is one of the most effective approaches to achieving this goal. In this paper, we propose a filtering-based, tightly coupled global navigation satellite system (GNSS)-visual-inertial positioning framework with a pose-only formulation applied to the visual-inertial system (VINS), termed PO-GVINS. Specifically, multiple-view imaging used in current VINS requires a priori of 3D feature, then jointly estimate camera poses and 3D feature position, which inevitably introduces linearization error of the feature as well as facing dimensional explosion. However, the pose-only (PO) formulation, which is demonstrated to be equivalent to the multiple-view imaging and has been applied in visual reconstruction, represent feature depth using two camera poses and thus 3D feature position is removed from state vector avoiding aforementioned difficulties. Inspired by this, we first apply PO formulation in our VINS, i.e., PO-VINS. GNSS raw measurements are then incorporated with integer ambiguity resolved to achieve accurate and drift-free estimation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed PO-VINS significantly outperforms the multi-state constrained Kalman filter (MSCKF). By incorporating GNSS measurements, PO-GVINS achieves accurate, drift-free state estimation, making it a robust solution for positioning in challenging environments.</p></details> |  |

However, existing vision-only 3D-GS methods often rely on hand-crafted heuristics for point-cloud densification and face challenges in handling occlusions and high GPU memory and computation consumption. LiDAR-Inertial-Visual (LIV) sensor configuration has demonstrated superior performance in localization and dense mapping by leveraging complementary sensing characteristics: rich texture information from cameras, precise geometric measurements from LiDAR, and high-frequency motion data from IMU. Inspired by this, we propose a novel real-time Gaussian-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) system. Our map system comprises a global Gaussian map and a sliding window of Gaussians, along with an IESKF-based odometry. The global Gaussian map consists of hash-indexed voxels organized in a recursive octree, effectively covering sparse spatial volumes while adapting to different levels of detail and scales. The Gaussian map is initialized through multi-sensor fusion and optimized with photometric gradients. Our system incrementally maintains a sliding window of Gaussians, significantly reducing GPU computation and memory consumption by only optimizing the map within the sliding window. Moreover, we implement a tightly coupled multi-sensor fusion odometry with an iterative error state Kalman filter (IESKF), leveraging real-time updating and rendering of the Gaussian map. Our system represents the first real-time Gaussian-based SLAM framework deployable on resource-constrained embedded systems, demonstrated on the NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX platform. The framework achieves real-time performance while maintaining robust multi-sensor fusion capabilities. All implementation algorithms, hardware designs, and CAD models will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data-driven Bayesian State Estimation with Compressed Measurement of Model-free Process using Semi-supervised Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07368v2)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The research topic is: data-driven Bayesian state estimation with compressed measurement (BSCM) of model-free process, say for a (causal) tracking application. The dimension of the temporal measurement vector is lower than the dimension of the temporal state vector to be estimated. Hence the state estimation problem is an underdetermined inverse problem. The underlying dynamical model of the states is assumed to be unknown and hence, we use the terminology 'model-free process'. In absence of the dynamical model, we can not employ traditional model-driven methods like Kalman Filter (KF) and Particle Filter (PF), and instead require data-driven methods. We first experimentally show that two existing unsupervised learning-based data-driven methods fail to address the BSCM problem for model-free process; they are - data-driven nonlinear state estimation (DANSE) method and deep Markov model (DMM) method. The unsupervised learning uses unlabelled data comprised of only noisy, linear measurements. While DANSE provides a good predictive / forecasting performance to model the temporal measurement data as time-series, its unsupervised learning lacks a regularization for state estimation. We then investigate the use of a semi-supervised learning approach, and develop a semi-supervised learning-based DANSE method, referred to as SemiDANSE. In SemiDANSE, we use a limited amount of labelled data along-with a large amount of unlabelled data, and that helps to bring the desired regularization for addressing the BSCM problem. The labelled data means pairwise measurement-and-state data. Using three chaotic dynamical systems (or processes) with nonlinear dynamical models as benchmark, we show that the data-driven SemiDANSE provides competitive performance for BSCM against a hybrid method called KalmanNet and two model-driven methods -- an extended KF (EKF) and an unscented KF (UKF).</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, under review at IEEE TSP</p></details> |

In addition to considering strong cues such as motion and appearance information, we also consider weak cues such as height intersection-over-union (height-IoU) and tracklet confidence information in the data association using different fusion methods. These fusion methods include minimum, weighted sum based on IoU, Kalman filter (KF) gating, and hadamard product of costs due to the different cues. We conduct extensive evaluations on validation sets of MOT17, MOT20 and DanceTrack datasets, and find out that the choice of a fusion method is key for data association in multi-object visual tracking. We hope that this investigative work helps the computer vision research community to use the right fusion method for data association in multi-object visual tracking.</p></details> |  |

Unfortunately, the performance of such lightweight sensors varies with the dynamic environment, and the fidelity of the dynamic model is also severely affected by environmental aerial flow. To address this challenge, we propose an adaptive sliding window estimator equipped with an estimation reliability evaluator, where the states, noise covariance matrices and aerial drag are estimated simultaneously. The aerial drag effects are first evaluated based on posterior states and covariance. Then, an augmented Kalman filter is designed to pre-process multidimensional measurements and inherit historical information. Subsequently, an inverse-Wishart smoother is employed to estimate posterior states and covariance matrices. To further suppress potential divergence, a reliability evaluator is devised to infer estimation errors. We further determine the fidelity of each sensor based on the error propagation. Extensive experiments are conducted in both standard and harsh environments, demonstrating the adaptability and robustness of the proposed method. The root mean square error reaches 0.15 m, outperforming the state-of-the-art approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

To maintain temporal consistency, large-size instances detected in the current frame are compared and associated with instances within a temporal window that includes the current and preceding frames. However, their reliance on short-term instance detection, lack of motion estimation, and exclusion of small-sized instances lead to frequent identity switches and reduced tracking performance. We address these issues with the NextStop1 tracker, which integrates Kalman filter-based motion estimation, data association, and lifespan management, along with a tracklet state concept to improve prioritization. Evaluated using the LiDAR Segmentation and Tracking Quality (LSTQ) metric on the SemanticKITTI validation set, NextStop demonstrated enhanced tracking performance, particularly for small-sized objects like people and bicyclists, with fewer ID switches, earlier tracking initiation, and improved reliability in complex environments.

The embedding may be learned simultaneously using reproducing kernels, for example, constructed with feed-forward neural networks. We also address the generalization of sequential state-estimation (Kalman filtering) in stochastic nonlinear systems, and of operator-based eigen-mode decomposition of dynamics, for the representation. Several examples with synthetic and real-world data are shown to illustrate the empirical characteristics of our methods, and to investigate the performance of our model in sequential state-estimation and mode decomposition.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional LIO systems tend to focus more on localization rather than mapping, with maps consisting mostly of sparse geometric elements, which is not ideal for downstream tasks. Recent emerging neural field technology has great potential in dense mapping, but pure LiDAR mapping is difficult to work on high-dynamic vehicles. To mitigate this challenge, we present a new solution that tightly couples geometric kinematics with neural fields to enhance simultaneous state estimation and dense mapping capabilities. We propose both semi-coupled and tightly coupled Kinematic-Neural LIO (KN-LIO) systems that leverage online SDF decoding and iterated error-state Kalman filtering to fuse laser and inertial data. Our KN-LIO minimizes information loss and improves accuracy in state estimation, while also accommodating asynchronous multi-LiDAR inputs. Evaluations on diverse high-dynamic datasets demonstrate that our KN-LIO achieves performance on par with or superior to existing state-of-the-art solutions in pose estimation and offers improved dense mapping accuracy over pure LiDAR-based methods. The relevant code and datasets will be made available at https://**.</p></details> |  |

Each latent factor process has its own correlation and variance parameters, and the orthogonal factor loading matrix can be either fixed or estimated. We utilize an orthogonal factor loading matrix that avoids computing the inversion of the posterior covariance matrix at each time of the Kalman filter, and derive closed-form expressions in an expectation-maximization algorithm for parameter estimation, which substantially reduces the computational complexity without approximation. Our study is motivated by inversely estimating slow slip events from geodetic data, such as continuous GPS measurements. Extensive simulated studies illustrate higher accuracy and scalability of our approach compared to alternatives. By applying our method to geodetic measurements in the Cascadia region, our estimated slip better agrees with independently measured seismic data of tremor events. The substantial acceleration from our method enables the use of massive noisy data for geological hazard quantification and other applications.</p></details> |  |

FIRs, owing to their minuscule weight and size, offer unparalleled advantages in terms of material cost and scalability. However, their size introduces considerable control challenges, notably high-speed dynamics, restricted power, and limited payload capacity. While there have been notable advancements in developing lightweight sensors, often drawing inspiration from biological systems, no sub-gram aircraft has been able to attain sustained hover without relying on feedback from external sensing such as a motion capture system. The lightest vehicle capable of sustained hover -- the first level of "sensor autonomy" -- is the much larger 28 g Crazyflie. Previous work reported a reduction in size of that vehicle's avionics suite to 187 mg and 21 mW. Here, we report a further reduction in mass and power to only 78.4 mg and 15 mW. We replaced the laser rangefinder with a lighter and more efficient pressure sensor, and built a smaller optic flow sensor around a global-shutter imaging chip. A Kalman Filter (KF) fuses these measurements to estimate the state variables that are needed to control hover: pitch angle, translational velocity, and altitude. Our system achieved performance comparable to that of the Crazyflie's estimator while in flight, with root mean squared errors of 1.573 degrees, 0.186 m/s, and 0.139 m, respectively, relative to motion capture.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to a robotics conference</p></details> |

However, it still drifts over extended periods because of the absence of external correction signals. To achieve the goal of long-term accurate localization, we propose Wheel-GINS, a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)/inertial navigation system (INS) integrated navigation system using a Wheel-IMU. Wheel-GINS fuses the GNSS position measurement with the Wheel-IMU via an extended Kalman filter to limit the long-term error drift and provide continuous state estimation when the GNSS signal is blocked. Considering the specificities of the GNSS/Wheel-IMU integration, we conduct detailed modeling and online estimation of the Wheel-IMU installation parameters, including the Wheel-IMU leverarm and mounting angle and the wheel radius error. Experimental results have shown that Wheel-GINS outperforms the traditional GNSS/Odometer/INS integrated navigation system during GNSS outages. At the same time, Wheel-GINS can effectively estimate the Wheel-IMU installation parameters online and, consequently, improve the localization accuracy and practicality of the system. The source code of our implementation is publicly available (https://github.com/i2Nav-WHU/Wheel-GINS).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems</p></details> |
| **[Sequential drone routing for data assimilation on a 2D airborne contaminant dispersion problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10346v3)** | 2025-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The combined use of data from different sources can be critical in emergencies, where accurate models are needed to make real-time decisions, but high-fidelity representations and detailed information are simply unavailable. This study presents a data assimilation framework based on an ensemble Kalman filter that sequentially exploits and improves an advection-diffusion model in a case study concerning an airborne contaminant dispersion problem over a complex two-dimensional domain. An autonomous aerial drone is used to sequentially observe the actual contaminant concentration in a small fraction of the domain, orders of magnitude smaller than the total domain area. Such observations are synchronized with the data assimilation framework, iteratively adjusting the simulation. The path of the drone is sequentially optimized by balancing exploration and exploitation according to the available knowledge at each decision time. Starting from an erroneous initial model based on approximated assumptions that represent the limited initial knowledge available during emergency scenarios, results show how the proposed framework sequentially improves its belief about the dispersion dynamics, thus providing a reliable contaminant concentration map.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Generative Model-Aided Power System Dynamic State Estimation and Reconstruction with Unknown Control Inputs or Data Distributions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02928v1)** | 2025-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fast and robust dynamic state estimation (DSE) is essential for accurately capturing the internal dynamic processes of power systems, and it serves as the foundation for reliably implementing real-time dynamic modeling, monitoring, and control applications. Nonetheless, on one hand, traditional DSE methods based on Kalman filtering or particle filtering have high accuracy requirements for system parameters, control inputs, phasor measurement unit (PMU) data, and centralized DSE communication. Consequently, these methods often face accuracy bottlenecks when dealing with structural or system process errors, unknown control vectors, PMU anomalies, and communication contingencies. On the other hand, deep learning-aided DSE, while parameter-free, often suffers from generalization issues under unforeseen operating conditions. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an effective approach that leverages deep generative models from AI-generated content (AIGC) to assist DSE. The proposed approach employs an encoder-decoder architecture to estimate unknown control input variables, a robust encoder to mitigate the impact of bad PMU data, and latent diffusion model to address communication issues in centralized DSE. Additionally, a lightweight adaptor is designed to quickly adjust the latent vector distribution. Extensive experimental results on the IEEE 39-bus system and the NPCC 140-bus system demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in addressing DSE modeling imperfection, measurement uncertainties, communication contingencies, and unknown distribution challenges, while also proving its ability to reduce data storage and communication resource requirements.</p></details> |  |

A critical challenge in this domain is precise localization, particularly in LiDAR-based map matching, which is prone to errors due to degeneracy in the data. Most sensor fusion techniques, such as the Kalman filter, rely on accurate error covariance estimates for each sensor to improve localization accuracy. However, obtaining reliable covariance values for map matching remains a complex task. To address this challenge, we propose a neural network-based framework for predicting localization error covariance in LiDAR map matching. To achieve this, we introduce a novel dataset generation method specifically designed for error covariance estimation. In our evaluation using a Kalman filter, we achieved a 2 cm improvement in localization accuracy, a significant enhancement in this domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2024 International Conference on Intelligent Computing and its Emerging Applications</p></details> |

To tackle some of the challenges associated with indoor tracking, this study explores the potential benefits of incorporating the SO(3) manifold structure of the rotation matrix. The goal is to enhance the 3D tracking performance of the extended Kalman filter (EKF) and unscented Kalman filter (UKF) of a moving target within an indoor environment. Our results demonstrate that the proposed extended Kalman filter with Riemannian (EKFRie) and unscented Kalman filter with Riemannian (UKFRie) algorithms consistently outperform the conventional EKF and UKF in terms of position and orientation accuracy. While the conventional EKF and UKF achieved root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.36m and 0.43m, respectively, for a long stair path, the proposed EKFRie and UKFRie algorithms achieved a lower RMSE of 0.21m and 0.10m. Our results show also the outperforming of the proposed algorithms over the EKF and UKF algorithms with the Isosceles triangle manifold. While the latter achieved RMSE of 7.26cm and 7.27cm, respectively, our proposed algorithms achieved RMSE of 6.73cm and 6.16cm. These results demonstrate the enhanced performance of the proposed algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[HybridTrack: A Hybrid Approach for Robust Multi-Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01275v1)** | 2025-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The evolution of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) has increased the need for robust and generalizable algorithms for multi-object tracking. Traditional statistical model-based tracking methods rely on predefined motion models and assumptions about system noise distributions. Although computationally efficient, they often lack adaptability to varying traffic scenarios and require extensive manual design and parameter tuning. To address these issues, we propose a novel 3D multi-object tracking approach for vehicles, HybridTrack, which integrates a data-driven Kalman Filter (KF) within a tracking-by-detection paradigm. In particular, it learns the transition residual and Kalman gain directly from data, which eliminates the need for manual motion and stochastic parameter modeling. Validated on the real-world KITTI dataset, HybridTrack achieves 82.08% HOTA accuracy, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods. We also evaluate our method under different configurations, achieving the fastest processing speed of 112 FPS. Consequently, HybridTrack eliminates the dependency on scene-specific designs while improving performance and maintaining real-time efficiency. The code will be publicly available at the time of publishing: https://github.com/leandro-svg/HybridTrack.git.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

In this study, we comprehensively analyze the complexity of the eye movement prediction task associated with subjects. We use three fundamentally different models within the analysis: the lightweight Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM), the transformer-based network for multivariate time series representation learning (TST), and the Oculomotor Plant Mathematical Model wrapped in the Kalman Filter framework (OPKF). Each solution is assessed following a sample-to-event evaluation strategy and employing the new event-to-subject metrics. Our results show that the different models maintained similar prediction performance trends pertaining to subjects. We refer to these outcomes as per-subject complexity since some subjects' data pose a more significant challenge for models. Along with the detailed correlation analysis, this report investigates the source of the per-subject complexity and discusses potential solutions to overcome it.</p></details> | 14 pages |
| **[An Observation-Driven State-Space Model for Claims Size Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21099v1)** | 2024-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-space models are popular models in econometrics. Recently, these models have gained some popularity in the actuarial literature. The best known state-space models are of Kalman-filter type. These models are so-called parameter-driven because the observations do not impact the state-space dynamics. A second less well-known class of state-space models are so-called observation-driven state-space models where the state-space dynamics is also impacted by the actual observations. A typical example is the Poisson-Gamma observation-driven state-space model for counts data. This Poisson-Gamma model is fully analytically tractable. The goal of this paper is to develop a Gamma- Gamma observation-driven state-space model for claim size modeling. We provide fully tractable versions of Gamma-Gamma observation-driven state-space models, and these versions extend the work of Smith and Miller (1986) by allowing for a fully flexible variance behavior. Additionally, we demonstrate that the proposed model aligns with evolutionary credibility, a methodology in insurance that dynamically adjusts premium rates over time using evolving data.</p></details> | 28 pages |
| **[Deep Kalman Filters Can Filter](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19603v2)** | 2024-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep Kalman filters (DKFs) are a class of neural network models that generate Gaussian probability measures from sequential data. Though DKFs are inspired by the Kalman filter, they lack concrete theoretical ties to the stochastic filtering problem, thus limiting their applicability to areas where traditional model-based filters have been used, e.g.\ model calibration for bond and option prices in mathematical finance. We address this issue in the mathematical foundations of deep learning by exhibiting a class of continuous-time DKFs which can approximately implement the conditional law of a broad class of non-Markovian and conditionally Gaussian signal processes given noisy continuous-times measurements. Our approximation results hold uniformly over sufficiently regular compact subsets of paths, where the approximation error is quantified by the worst-case 2-Wasserstein distance computed uniformly over the given compact set of paths.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scalable marginalization of correlated latent variables with applications to learning particle interaction kernels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.08389v4)** | 2024-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Marginalization of latent variables or nuisance parameters is a fundamental aspect of Bayesian inference and uncertainty quantification. In this work, we focus on scalable marginalization of latent variables in modeling correlated data, such as spatio-temporal or functional observations. We first introduce Gaussian processes (GPs) for modeling correlated data and highlight the computational challenge, where the computational complexity increases cubically fast along with the number of observations. We then review the connection between the state space model and GPs with Mat{\'e}rn covariance for temporal inputs. The Kalman filter and Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoother were introduced as a scalable marginalization technique for computing the likelihood and making predictions of GPs without approximation. We then introduce recent efforts on extending the scalable marginalization idea to the linear model of coregionalization for multivariate correlated output and spatio-temporal observations. In the final part of this work, we introduce a novel marginalization technique to estimate interaction kernels and forecast particle trajectories. The achievement lies in the sparse representation of covariance function, then applying conjugate gradient for solving the computational challenges and improving predictive accuracy. The computational advances achieved in this work outline a wide range of applications in molecular dynamic simulation, cellular migration, and agent-based models.</p></details> | <details><summary>A typ...</summary><p>A typo in $\mathbf W_1$ in Appendix was corrected</p></details> |
| **[Preventing output saturation in active noise control: An output-constrained Kalman filter approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18887v1)** | 2024-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Kalman filter (KF)-based active noise control (ANC) system demonstrates superior tracking and faster convergence compared to the least mean square (LMS) method, particularly in dynamic noise cancellation scenarios. However, in environments with extremely high noise levels, the power of the control signal can exceed the system's rated output power due to hardware limitations, leading to output saturation and subsequent non-linearity. To mitigate this issue, a modified KF with an output constraint is proposed. In this approach, the disturbance treated as an measurement is re-scaled by a constraint factor, which is determined by the system's rated power, the secondary path gain, and the disturbance power. As a result, the output power of the system, i.e. the control signal, is indirectly constrained within the maximum output of the system, ensuring stability. Simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm not only achieves rapid suppression of dynamic noise but also effectively prevents non-linearity due to output saturation, highlighting its practical significance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimal-state Dynamics Estimation for Physics-based Human Motion Capture from Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07795v3)** | 2024-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human motion capture from monocular videos has made significant progress in recent years. However, modern approaches often produce temporal artifacts, e.g. in form of jittery motion and struggle to achieve smooth and physically plausible motions. Explicitly integrating physics, in form of internal forces and exterior torques, helps alleviating these artifacts. Current state-of-the-art approaches make use of an automatic PD controller to predict torques and reaction forces in order to re-simulate the input kinematics, i.e. the joint angles of a predefined skeleton. However, due to imperfect physical models, these methods often require simplifying assumptions and extensive preprocessing of the input kinematics to achieve good performance. To this end, we propose a novel method to selectively incorporate the physics models with the kinematics observations in an online setting, inspired by a neural Kalman-filtering approach. We develop a control loop as a meta-PD controller to predict internal joint torques and external reaction forces, followed by a physics-based motion simulation. A recurrent neural network is introduced to realize a Kalman filter that attentively balances the kinematics input and simulated motion, resulting in an optimal-state dynamics prediction. We show that this filtering step is crucial to provide an online supervision that helps balancing the shortcoming of the respective input motions, thus being important for not only capturing accurate global motion trajectories but also producing physically plausible human poses. The proposed approach excels in the physics-based human pose estimation task and demonstrates the physical plausibility of the predictive dynamics, compared to state of the art.

| **[Gaussian entropic optimal transport: Schrödinger bridges and the Sinkhorn algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18432v1)** | 2024-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Entropic optimal transport problems are regularized versions of optimal transport problems. These models play an increasingly important role in machine learning and generative modelling. For finite spaces, these problems are commonly solved using Sinkhorn algorithm (a.k.a. iterative proportional fitting procedure). However, in more general settings the Sinkhorn iterations are based on nonlinear conditional/conjugate transformations and exact finite-dimensional solutions cannot be computed. This article presents a finite-dimensional recursive formulation of the iterative proportional fitting procedure for general Gaussian multivariate models. As expected, this recursive formulation is closely related to the celebrated Kalman filter and related Riccati matrix difference equations, and it yields algorithms that can be implemented in practical settings without further approximations. We extend this filtering methodology to develop a refined and self-contained convergence analysis of Gaussian Sinkhorn algorithms, including closed form expressions of entropic transport maps and Schr\"odinger bridges.</p></details> | 68 pages |

To predict the states of the system, the Holt's exponential smoothing techniques and nonlinear dynamic equations of gas pipelines are applied to establish the power and gas system equations, respectively. The square-root cubature Kalman filter algorithm is utilized to address the numerical challenges posed by the strongly nonlinear system equations. The boundary conditions in the gas system include the flow balances at sink nodes, and the mass flow rates of loads have to be predicted at each computation step. For the prediction of load mass flows, the long short-term memory network is employed, known for its effectiveness in time series prediction. Consequently, a combined method based on the square-root cubature Kalman filter and the long short-term memory network is proposed for tracking integrated gas and power systems. To evaluate the tracking performances of the proposed method, the IEEE-39 bus power system and GasLib-40 node gas system are used to form the testing system. Simulation results demonstrate high precision in tracking the dynamic states of power and gas systems. Two indexes are introduced for a numerical analysis of the tracking results, indicating that the accuracy of this method surpasses that of traditional measurements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics</p></details> |
| **[Selective Kalman Filter: When and How to Fuse Multi-Sensor Information to Overcome Degeneracy in SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17235v1)** | 2024-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Research trends in SLAM systems are now focusing more on multi-sensor fusion to handle challenging and degenerative environments. However, most existing multi-sensor fusion SLAM methods mainly use all of the data from a range of sensors, a strategy we refer to as the all-in method. This method, while merging the benefits of different sensors, also brings in their weaknesses, lowering the robustness and accuracy and leading to high computational demands. To address this, we propose a new fusion approach -- Selective Kalman Filter -- to carefully choose and fuse information from multiple sensors (using LiDAR and visual observations as examples in this paper). For deciding when to fuse data, we implement degeneracy detection in LiDAR SLAM, incorporating visual measurements only when LiDAR SLAM exhibits degeneracy. Regarding degeneracy detection, we propose an elegant yet straightforward approach to determine the degeneracy of LiDAR SLAM and to identify the specific degenerative direction. This method fully considers the coupled relationship between rotational and translational constraints. In terms of how to fuse data, we use visual measurements only to update the specific degenerative states. As a result, our proposed method improves upon the all-in method by greatly enhancing real-time performance due to less processing visual data, and it introduces fewer errors from visual measurements. Experiments demonstrate that our method for degeneracy detection and fusion, in addressing degeneracy issues, exhibits higher precision and robustness compared to other state-of-the-art methods, and offers enhanced real-time performance relative to the all-in method. The code is openly available.</p></details> |  |

However, in the task of Multiple Object Tracking (MOT), leveraging the power of Transformers remains relatively unexplored. Among the pioneering efforts in this domain, TransCenter, a Transformer-based MOT architecture with dense object queries, demonstrated exceptional tracking capabilities while maintaining reasonable runtime. Nonetheless, one critical aspect in MOT, track displacement estimation, presents room for enhancement to further reduce association errors. In response to this challenge, our paper introduces a novel improvement to TransCenter. We propose a post-processing mechanism grounded in the Track-by-Detection paradigm, aiming to refine the track displacement estimation. Our approach involves the integration of a carefully designed Kalman filter, which incorporates Transformer outputs into measurement error estimation, and the use of an embedding network for target re-identification. This combined strategy yields substantial improvement in the accuracy and robustness of the tracking process. We validate our contributions through comprehensive experiments on the MOTChallenge datasets MOT17 and MOT20, where our proposed approach outperforms other Transformer-based trackers.

It uses CCTV footage, for example, to record only major events-like the appearance of a person or a thief-so that storage is optimized and digital searches are easier. It utilizes the latest techniques in object detection and tracking, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) like YOLO, SSD, and Faster R-CNN, as well as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs), to achieve high accuracy in detection and capture temporal dependencies. The approach incorporates adaptive background modeling through Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) and optical flow methods like Lucas-Kanade to detect motions. Multi-scale and contextual analysis are used to improve detection across different object sizes and environments. A hybrid motion segmentation strategy combines statistical and deep learning models to manage complex movements, while optimizations for real-time processing ensure efficient computation. Tracking methods, such as Kalman Filters and Siamese networks, are employed to maintain smooth tracking even in cases of occlusion. Detection is improved on various-sized objects for multiple scenarios by multi-scale and contextual analysis. Results demonstrate high precision and recall in detecting and tracking objects, with significant improvements in processing times and accuracy due to real-time optimizations and illumination-invariant features.

Our approach combines linear stochastic estimation and Kalman filtering algorithms to assimilate and process real-time field measurements with the predictions of a stochastic reduced-order model that is confined to a two-dimensional plane at the hub height of turbines. We bridge the vertical gap between the computational plane of the model at hub height and the measurement plane on the ground using a projection technique that allows us to infer the pressure in one plane from the other. Depending on the quality of this inference, we show that customized variants of the extended and ensemble Kalman filters can be tuned to balance estimation quality and computational speed 1-1.5 diameters ahead and behind leading turbines. In particular, we show how synchronizing the sign of estimates with that of velocity fluctuations recorded at the nacelle can significantly improve the ability to follow temporal variations upwind of the leading turbine. We also propose a convex optimization-based framework for selecting a subset of pressure sensors that achieve a desired level of accuracy relative to the optimal Kalman filter that uses all sensing capabilities.</p></details> | 23 pages, 24 figures |

However, agro-food environments pose difficulties for robots due to high variation and occlusions. In the presence of these challenges, accurate world models, with information about object location, shape, and properties, are crucial for robots to perform tasks accurately. Building such models is challenging due to the complex and unique nature of agro-food environments, and errors in the model can lead to task execution issues. In this paper, MinkSORT, a novel method for generating tracking features using a 3D sparse convolutional network in a deepSORT-like approach, is proposed to improve the accuracy of world models in agro-food environments. MinkSORT was evaluated using real-world data collected in a tomato greenhouse, where it significantly improved the performance of a baseline model that tracks tomato positions in 3D using a Kalman filter and Mahalanobis distance. MinkSORT improved the HOTA from 42.8% to 44.77%, the association accuracy from 32.55% to 35.55%, and the MOTA from 57.63% to 58.81%. Different contrastive loss functions for training MinkSORT were also evaluated, and it was demonstrated that it leads to improved performance in terms of three separate precision and recall detection outcomes. The proposed method improves world model accuracy, enabling robots to perform tasks such as harvesting and plant maintenance with greater efficiency and accuracy, which is essential for meeting the growing demand for food in a sustainable manner.</p></details> |  |

Methods such as the multi-fidelity ensemble Kalman filter (MF-EnKF) and the multi-level ensemble Kalman filter (ML-EnKF) are recognized as state-of-the-art techniques. However, in many cases, the construction of low-fidelity models in an offline stage, before solving the data assimilation problem, prevents them from being both accurate and computationally efficient. In our work, we investigate the use of adaptive reduced basis techniques in which the approximation space is modified online based on the information that is extracted from a limited number of full order solutions and that is carried by the past models. This allows to simultaneously ensure good accuracy and low cost for the employed models and thus improve the performance of the multi-fidelity and multi-level methods.</p></details> |  |

| **[Hybrid Two-level MCMC with Deep Learning Surrogates for Bayesian Inverse Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01463v2)** | 2024-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bayesian inverse problems arise in various scientific and engineering domains, and solving them can be computationally demanding. This is especially the case for problems governed by partial differential equations, where the repeated evaluation of the forward operator is extremely expensive. Recent advances in Deep Learning (DL)-based surrogate models have shown promising potential to accelerate the solution of such problems. However, despite their ability to learn from complex data, DL-based surrogate models generally cannot match the accuracy of high-fidelity numerical models, which limits their practical applicability. We propose a novel hybrid two-level Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method that combines the strengths of DL-based surrogate models and high-fidelity numerical solvers to solve Bayesian inverse problems governed by partial differential equations. The intuition is to leverage the inference speed of a DL-based surrogate model as the base chain, and correct its errors using a limited number of high-fidelity numerical model evaluations in a correction chain; hence its name hybrid two-level MCMC method. Through a detailed theoretical analysis, we show that our approach can achieve the same accuracy as a pure numerical MCMC method while requiring only a small fraction of the computational cost. The theoretical analysis is further supported by several numerical experiments on the Poisson, reaction-diffusion, and Navier-Stokes equations. The proposed hybrid framework can be generalized to other approaches such as the ensemble Kalman filter and sequential Monte Carlo methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modelling and Control of Subsonic Missile for Air-to-Air Interception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07594v2)** | 2024-12-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Subsonic missiles play an important role in modern air-to-air combat scenarios - utilized by the F-35 Lightning II - but require complex Guidance, Navigation and Control systems to manoeuvre with 30G's of acceleration to intercept successfully. Challenges with mathematically modelling and controlling such a dynamic system must be addressed, high frequency noise rejected, and actuator delay compensated for. This paper aims to investigate the control systems necessary for interception. It also proposes a subsonic design utilizing literature and prior research, suggests aerodynamic derivatives, and analyses a designed 2D reduced pitch autopilot control system response against performances. The pitch autopilot model contains an optimized PID controller, 2nd order actuator, lead compensator and Kalman Filter, that rejects time varying disturbances and high frequency noise expected during flight. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method through reduction in rise time (21%), settle time (10%), and highlighted its high frequency deficiency with respect to the compensator integration. The actuator delay of 100ms has been negated by the augmented compensator autopilot controller so that it exceeds system performance requirements (1) & (3). However, (2) is not satisfied as 370% overshoot exists. This research confirms the importance of a lead compensator in missile GNC systems and furthers control design application through a specific configuration. Future research should build upon methods and models presented to construct and test an interception scenario.</p></details> |  |
| **[Affine EKF: Exploring and Utilizing Sufficient and Necessary Conditions for Observability Maintenance to Improve EKF Consistency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10809v1)** | 2024-12-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inconsistency issue is one crucial challenge for the performance of extended Kalman filter (EKF) based methods for state estimation problems, which is mainly affected by the discrepancy of observability between the EKF model and the underlying dynamic system. In this work, some sufficient and necessary conditions for observability maintenance are first proved. We find that under certain conditions, an EKF can naturally maintain correct observability if the corresponding linearization makes unobservable subspace independent of the state values. Based on this theoretical finding, a novel affine EKF (Aff-EKF) framework is proposed to overcome the inconsistency of standard EKF (Std-EKF) by affine transformations, which not only naturally satisfies the observability constraint but also has a clear design procedure. The advantages of our Aff-EKF framework over some commonly used methods are demonstrated through mathematical analyses. The effectiveness of our proposed method is demonstrated on three simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) applications with different types of features, typical point features, point features on a horizontal plane and plane features. Specifically, following the proposed procedure, the naturally consistent Aff-EKFs can be explicitly derived for these problems. The consistency improvement of these Aff-EKFs are validated by Monte Carlo simulations.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Visual-inertial Localization Algorithm using Opportunistic Visual Beacons and Dead-Reckoning for GNSS-Denied Large-scale Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19845v2)** | 2024-12-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the development of smart cities, the demand for continuous pedestrian navigation in large-scale urban environments has significantly increased. While global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) provide low-cost and reliable positioning services, they are often hindered in complex urban canyon environments. Thus, exploring opportunistic signals for positioning in urban areas has become a key solution. Augmented reality (AR) allows pedestrians to acquire real-time visual information. Accordingly, we propose a low-cost visual-inertial positioning solution. This method comprises a lightweight multi-scale group convolution (MSGC)-based visual place recognition (VPR) neural network, a pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) algorithm, and a visual/inertial fusion approach based on a Kalman filter with gross error suppression. The VPR serves as a conditional observation to the Kalman filter, effectively correcting the errors accumulated through the PDR method. This enables the entire algorithm to ensure the reliability of long-term positioning in GNSS-denied areas. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method maintains stable positioning during large-scale movements. Compared to the lightweight MobileNetV3-based VPR method, our proposed VPR solution improves Recall@1 by at least 3\% on two public datasets while reducing the number of parameters by 63.37\%. It also achieves performance that is comparable to the VGG16-based method. The VPR-PDR algorithm improves localization accuracy by more than 40\% compared to the original PDR.</p></details> |  |

These measurements exhibit complex temporal dynamics, necessitating sophisticated statistical models to capture patterns and detect deviations. We propose a novel multiprocess state space model with feedback and switching mechanisms to analyze the dynamics of clinical measurements. This model captures the evolution of time series through distinct latent processes and incorporates feedback effects in the transition probabilities between latent processes. We develop estimation methods using the EM algorithm, integrated with multiprocess Kalman filtering and multiprocess fixed-interval smoothing. Simulation study shows that the algorithm is efficient and performs well. We apply the proposed model to body temperature measurements from COVID-19-infected hemodialysis patients to examine temporal dynamics and estimate infection and recovery probabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Impact of Shoe Parameters on Gait Using Wearables](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10555v1)** | 2024-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The study of biomechanics during locomotion provides valuable insights into the effects of varying conditions on specific movement patterns. This research focuses on examining the influence of different shoe parameters on walking biomechanics, aiming to understand their impact on gait patterns. To achieve this, various methodologies are explored to estimate human body biomechanics, including computer vision techniques and wearable devices equipped with advanced sensors. Given privacy considerations and the need for robust, accurate measurements, this study employs wearable devices with Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors. These devices offer a non-invasive, precise, and high-resolution approach to capturing biomechanical data during locomotion. Raw sensor data collected from wearable devices is processed using an Extended Kalman Filter to reduce noise and extract meaningful information. This includes calculating joint angles throughout the gait cycle, enabling a detailed analysis of movement dynamics. The analysis identifies correlations between shoe parameters and key gait characteristics, such as stability, mobility, step time, and propulsion forces. The findings provide deeper insights into how footwear design influences walking efficiency and biomechanics. This study paves the way for advancements in footwear technology and contributes to the development of personalized solutions for enhancing gait performance and mobility.</p></details> |  |
| **[Invariant Kalman Filter for Relative Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10519v1)** | 2024-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents an invariant Kalman filter for estimating the relative trajectories between two dynamic systems. Invariant Kalman filters formulate the estimation error in terms of the group operation, ensuring that the error state does not depend on the current state estimate - a property referred to as state trajectory independence. This is particularly advantageous in extended Kalman filters, as it makes the propagation of the error covariance robust to large estimation errors. In this work, we construct invariant Kalman filters to the trajectory of one system relative to another. Specifically, we show that if the relative dynamics can be described solely by relative state variables, they automatically satisfy state trajectory independence, allowing for the development of an invariant Kalman filter. The corresponding relative invariant Kalman filter is formulated in an abstract fashion and is demonstrated numerically for the attitude dynamics of a rigid body.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Camera Movement Control from Real-World Drone Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09620v1)** | 2024-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study seeks to automate camera movement control for filming existing subjects into attractive videos, contrasting with the creation of non-existent content by directly generating the pixels. We select drone videos as our test case due to their rich and challenging motion patterns, distinctive viewing angles, and precise controls. Existing AI videography methods struggle with limited appearance diversity in simulation training, high costs of recording expert operations, and difficulties in designing heuristic-based goals to cover all scenarios. To avoid these issues, we propose a scalable method that involves collecting real-world training data to improve diversity, extracting camera trajectories automatically to minimize annotation costs, and training an effective architecture that does not rely on heuristics. Specifically, we collect 99k high-quality trajectories by running 3D reconstruction on online videos, connecting camera poses from consecutive frames to formulate 3D camera paths, and using Kalman filter to identify and remove low-quality data. Moreover, we introduce DVGFormer, an auto-regressive transformer that leverages the camera path and images from all past frames to predict camera movement in the next frame. We evaluate our system across 38 synthetic natural scenes and 7 real city 3D scans. We show that our system effectively learns to perform challenging camera movements such as navigating through obstacles, maintaining low altitude to increase perceived speed, and orbiting towers and buildings, which are very useful for recording high-quality videos.

| **[Temporal-Assisted Beamforming and Trajectory Prediction in Sensing-Enabled UAV Communications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09097v1)** | 2024-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the evolving landscape of high-speed communication, the shift from traditional pilot-based methods to a Sensing-Oriented Approach (SOA) is anticipated to gain momentum. This paper delves into the development of an innovative Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) framework, specifically tailored for beamforming and trajectory prediction processes. Central to this research is the exploration of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-enabled communication system, which seamlessly integrates ISAC technology. This integration underscores the synergistic interplay between sensing and communication capabilities. The proposed system initially deploys omnidirectional beams for the sensing-focused phase, subsequently transitioning to directional beams for precise object tracking. This process incorporates an Extended Kalman Filtering (EKF) methodology for the accurate estimation and prediction of object states. A novel frame structure is introduced, employing historical sensing data to optimize beamforming in real-time for subsequent time slots, a strategy we refer to as 'temporal-assisted' beamforming. To refine the temporal-assisted beamforming technique, we employ Successive Convex Approximation (SCA) in tandem with Iterative Rank Minimization (IRM), yielding high-quality suboptimal solutions. Comparative analysis with conventional pilot-based systems reveals that our approach yields a substantial improvement of 156\% in multi-object scenarios and 136\% in single-object scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Post-Hoc MOTS: Exploring the Capabilities of Time-Symmetric Multi-Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08313v1)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal forward-tracking has been the dominant approach for multi-object segmentation and tracking (MOTS). However, a novel time-symmetric tracking methodology has recently been introduced for the detection, segmentation, and tracking of budding yeast cells in pre-recorded samples. Although this architecture has demonstrated a unique perspective on stable and consistent tracking, as well as missed instance re-interpolation, its evaluation has so far been largely confined to settings related to videomicroscopic environments. In this work, we aim to reveal the broader capabilities, advantages, and potential challenges of this architecture across various specifically designed scenarios, including a pedestrian tracking dataset. We also conduct an ablation study comparing the model against its restricted variants and the widely used Kalman filter. Furthermore, we present an attention analysis of the tracking architecture for both pretrained and non-pretrained models</p></details> |  |
| **[Nonlinear Bayesian Filtering with Natural Gradient Gaussian Approximation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15832v3)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Practical Bayes filters often assume the state distribution of each time step to be Gaussian for computational tractability, resulting in the so-called Gaussian filters. When facing nonlinear systems, Gaussian filters such as extended Kalman filter (EKF) or unscented Kalman filter (UKF) typically rely on certain linearization techniques, which can introduce large estimation errors. To address this issue, this paper reconstructs the prediction and update steps of Gaussian filtering as solutions to two distinct optimization problems, whose optimal conditions are found to have analytical forms from Stein's lemma. It is observed that the stationary point for the prediction step requires calculating the first two moments of the prior distribution, which is equivalent to that step in existing moment-matching filters. In the update step, instead of linearizing the model to approximate the stationary points, we propose an iterative approach to directly minimize the update step's objective to avoid linearization errors. For the purpose of performing the steepest descent on the Gaussian manifold, we derive its natural gradient that leverages Fisher information matrix to adjust the gradient direction, accounting for the curvature of the parameter space. Combining this update step with moment matching in the prediction step, we introduce a new iterative filter for nonlinear systems called \textit{N}atural Gr\textit{a}dient Gaussia\textit{n} Appr\textit{o}ximation filter, or NANO filter for short. We prove that NANO filter locally converges to the optimal Gaussian approximation at each time step. Furthermore, the estimation error is proven exponentially bounded for nearly linear measurement equation and low noise levels through constructing a supermartingale-like property across consecutive time steps.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Aerial Collaborative Stereo: Real-Time Cross-Camera Feature Association and Relative Pose Estimation for UAVs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17504v2)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The collaborative visual perception of multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has increasingly become a research hotspot. Compared to a single UAV equipped with a short-baseline stereo camera, multi-UAV collaborative vision offers a wide and variable baseline, providing potential benefits in flexible and large-scale depth perception. In this paper, we propose the concept of a collaborative stereo camera, where the left and right cameras are mounted on two UAVs that share an overlapping FOV. Considering the dynamic flight of two UAVs in the real world, the FOV and relative pose of the left and right cameras are continuously changing. Compared to fixed-baseline stereo cameras, this aerial collaborative stereo system introduces two challenges, which are highly real-time requirements for dynamic cross-camera stereo feature association and relative pose estimation of left and right cameras. To address these challenges, we first propose a real-time dual-channel feature association algorithm with a guidance-prediction structure. Then, we propose a Relative Multi-State Constrained Kalman Filter (Rel-MSCKF) algorithm to estimate the relative pose by fusing co-visual features and UAVs' visual-inertial odometry (VIO). Extensive experiments are performed on the popular onboard computer NVIDIA NX. Results on the resource-constrained platform show that the real-time performance of the dual-channel feature association is significantly superior to traditional methods. The convergence of Rel-MSCKF is assessed under different initial baseline errors. In the end, we present a potential application of aerial collaborative stereo for remote mapping obstacles in urban scenarios. We hope this work can serve as a foundational study for more multi-UAV collaborative vision research. Online video: https://youtu.be/avxMuOf5Qcw</p></details> | 13 pages |

Moreover, the introduction of high quality legged robots into workplaces highlighted the crucial role of a robust, fully autonomous safety solution for robots to be viable in shared spaces or in co-existence with humans. This article establishes for the first time ever an innovative Detect-Track-and-Avoid Architecture (DTAA) to enhance safety and overall mission performance. The proposed novel architectyre has the merit ot integrating object detection using YOLOv8, utilizing Ultralytics embedded object tracking, and state estimation of tracked objects through Kalman filters. Moreover, a novel heuristic clustering is employed to facilitate active avoidance of multiple closely positioned objects with similar velocities, creating sets of unsafe spaces for the Nonlinear Model Predictive Controller (NMPC) to navigate around. The NMPC identifies the most hazardous unsafe space, considering not only their current positions but also their predicted future locations. In the sequel, the NMPC calculates maneuvers to guide the robot along a path planned by D$^{*}_{+}$ towards its intended destination, while maintaining a safe distance to all identified obstacles. The efficacy of the novelly suggested DTAA framework is being validated by Real-life experiments featuring a Boston Dynamics Spot robot that demonstrates the robot's capability to consistently maintain a safe distance from humans in dynamic subterranean, urban indoor, and outdoor environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[A switching Kalman filter approach to online mitigation and correction of sensor corruption for inertial navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06601v2)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a novel approach to detect and address faulty or corrupted external sensors in the context of inertial navigation by leveraging a switching Kalman Filter combined with parameter augmentation. Instead of discarding the corrupted data, the proposed method retains and processes it, running multiple observation models simultaneously and evaluating their likelihoods to accurately identify the true state of the system. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach to both identify the moment that a sensor becomes faulty and to correct for the resulting sensor behavior to maintain accurate estimates. We demonstrate our approach on an application of balloon navigation in the atmosphere and shuttle reentry. The results show that our method can accurately recover the true system state even in the presence of significant sensor bias, thereby improving the robustness and reliability of state estimation systems under challenging conditions. We also provide a statistical analysis of problem settings to determine when and where our method is most accurate and where it fails.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pedestrian Tracking with Monocular Camera using Unconstrained 3D Motion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11978v2)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A first-principle single-object model is proposed for pedestrian tracking. It is assumed that the extent of the moving object can be described via known statistics in 3D, such as pedestrian height. The proposed model thus need not constrain the object motion in 3D to a common ground plane, which is usual in 3D visual tracking applications. A nonlinear filter for this model is implemented using the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) and tested using the publicly available MOT-17 dataset. The proposed solution yields promising results in 3D while maintaining perfect results when projected into the 2D image. Moreover, the estimation error covariance matches the true one. Unlike conventional methods, the introduced model parameters have convenient meaning and can readily be adjusted for a problem.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to FUSION2024 conference</p></details> |
| **[Harmonic Mean Density Fusion in Distributed Tracking: Performance and Comparison](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06725v1)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A distributed sensor fusion architecture is preferred in a real target-tracking scenario as compared to a centralized scheme since it provides many practical advantages in terms of computation load, communication bandwidth, fault-tolerance, and scalability. In multi-sensor target-tracking literature, such systems are better known by the pseudonym - track fusion, since processed tracks are fused instead of raw measurements. A fundamental problem, however, in such systems is the presence of unknown correlations between the tracks, which renders a standard Kalman filter (naive fusion) useless. A widely accepted solution is covariance intersection (CI) which provides near-optimal estimates but at the cost of a conservative covariance. Thus, the estimates are pessimistic, which might result in a delayed error convergence. Also, fusion of Gaussian mixture densities is an active area of research where standard methods of track fusion cannot be used. In this article, harmonic mean density (HMD) based fusion is discussed, which seems to handle both of these issues. We present insights on HMD fusion and prove that the method is a result of minimizing average Pearson divergence. This article also provides an alternative and easy implementation based on an importance-sampling-like method without the requirement of a proposal density. Similarity of HMD with inverse covariance intersection is an interesting find, and has been discussed in detail. Results based on a real-world multi-target multi-sensor scenario show that the proposed approach converges quickly than existing track fusion algorithms while also being consistent, as evident from the normalized estimation-error squared (NEES) plots.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Pooling-Based Track Fusion Strategies : Harmonic Mean Density](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06716v1)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In a distributed sensor fusion architecture, using standard Kalman filter (naive fusion) can lead to degraded results as track correlations are ignored and conservative fusion strategies are employed as a sub-optimal alternative to the problem. Since, Gaussian mixtures provide a flexible means of modeling any density, therefore fusion strategies suitable for use with Gaussian mixtures are needed. While the generalized covariance intersection (CI) provides a means to fuse Gaussian mixtures, the procedure is cumbersome and requires evaluating a non-integer power of the mixture density. In this paper, we develop a pooling-based fusion strategy using the harmonic mean density (HMD) interpolation of local densities and show that the proposed method can handle both Gaussian and mixture densities without much changes to the framework. Mathematical properties of the proposed fusion strategy are studied and simulated on 2D and 3D maneuvering target tracking scenarios. The simulations suggest that the proposed HMD fusion performs better than other conservative strategies in terms of root-mean-squared error while being consistent.</p></details> |  |

The main difficulty lies in the sparsity of the motion data compared to the wide variation of the objects and environments as well as the poor availability of transition motions between different tasks, increasing the complexity of the generalization to arbitrary conditions. To cope with this issue, we develop a system that tackles the interaction synthesis problem as a hierarchical goal-driven task. Firstly, we develop a bimanual scheduler that plans a set of keyframes for simultaneously controlling the two hands to efficiently achieve the pick-and-place task from an abstract goal signal such as the target object selected by the user. Next, we develop a neural implicit planner that generates guidance hand trajectories under diverse object shape/types and obstacle layouts. Finally, we propose a linear dynamic model for our DeepPhase controller that incorporates a Kalman filter to enable smooth transitions in the frequency domain, resulting in a more realistic and effective multi-objective control of the character.Our system can produce a wide range of natural pick-and-place movements with respect to the geometry of objects, the articulation of containers and the layout of the objects in the scene.</p></details> | 19 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Ensemble Data Assimilation for Particle-based Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19525v2)** | 2024-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study presents a novel approach to applying data assimilation techniques for particle-based simulations using the Ensemble Kalman Filter. While data assimilation methods have been effectively applied to Eulerian simulations, their application in Lagrangian solution discretizations has not been properly explored. We introduce two specific methodologies to address this gap. The first methodology employs an intermediary Eulerian transformation that combines a projection with a remeshing process. The second is a purely Lagrangian scheme designed for situations where remeshing is not appropriate. The second is a purely Lagrangian scheme that is applicable when remeshing is not adapted. These methods are evaluated using a one-dimensional advection-diffusion model with periodic boundaries. Performance benchmarks for the one-dimensional scenario are conducted against a grid-based assimilation filter Subsequently, assimilation schemes are applied to a non-linear two-dimensional incompressible flow problem, solved via the Vortex-In-Cell method. The results demonstrate the feasibility of applying these methods in more complex scenarios, highlighting their effectiveness in both the one-dimensional and two-dimensional contexts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Interference Prediction for In-X 6G Sub-networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04876v1)** | 2024-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The sixth generation (6G) industrial Sub-networks (SNs) face several challenges in meeting extreme latency and reliability requirements in the order of 0.1-1 ms and 99.999 -to-99.99999 percentile, respectively. Interference management (IM) plays an integral role in addressing these requirements, especially in ultra-dense SN environments with rapidly varying interference induced by channel characteristics, mobility, and resource limitations. In general, IM can be achieved using resource allocation and \textit{accurate} Link adaptation (LA). In this work, we focus on the latter, where we first model interference at SN devices using the spatially consistent 3GPP channel model. Following this, we present a discrete-time dynamic state space model (DSSM) at a SN access point (AP), where interference power values (IPVs) are modeled as latent variables incorporating underlying modeling errors as well as transmission/protocol delays. Necessary approximations are then presented to simplify the DSSM and to efficiently employ the extended Kalman filter (EKF) for interference prediction. Unlike baseline methods, our proposed approach predicts IPVs solely based on the channel quality indicator (CQI) reports available at the SN AP at every transmission time interval (TTI). Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed approach clearly outperforms the conventional baseline. Furthermore, we also show that despite predicting with limited information, our proposed approach consistently achieves a comparable performance w.r.t the off-the-shelf supervised learning based baseline.</p></details> |  |

The highly nonlinear navigation kinematics are formulated to ensure global representation of the navigation problem. A computationally efficient Quaternion-based Navigation Unscented Kalman Filter (QNUKF) is proposed on $\mathbb{S}^{3}\times\mathbb{R}^{3}\times\mathbb{R}^{3}$ imitating the true nonlinear navigation kinematics and utilize onboard Visual-Inertial Navigation (VIN) units to achieve successful GPS-denied navigation. The proposed QNUKF is designed in discrete form to operate based on the data fusion of photographs garnered by a vision unit (stereo or monocular camera) and information collected by a low-cost inertial measurement unit (IMU). The photographs are processed to extract feature points in 3D space, while the 6-axis IMU supplies angular velocity and accelerometer measurements expressed with respect to the body-frame. Robustness and effectiveness of the proposed QNUKF have been confirmed through experiments on a real-world dataset collected by a drone navigating in 3D and consisting of stereo images and 6-axis IMU measurements. Also, the proposed approach is validated against standard state-of-the-art filtering techniques.

Since such datasets are often incomplete and noisy, it is useful to create the prediction surface of a spatial field. To this end, we consider an online filtering inference by using the Kalman filter based on linear Gaussian state-space models. However, the Kalman filter is impractically time-consuming when the number of locations in spatio-temporal datasets is large. To address this problem, we propose a multi-resolution filter via linear projection (MRF-lp), a fast computation method for online filtering inference. In the MRF-lp, by carrying out a multi-resolution approximation via linear projection (MRA-lp), the forecast covariance matrix can be approximated while capturing both the large- and small-scale spatial variations. As a result of this approximation, our proposed MRF-lp preserves a block-sparse structure of some matrices appearing in the MRF-lp through time, which leads to the scalability of this algorithm. Additionally, we discuss extensions of the MRF-lp to a nonlinear and non-Gaussian case. Simulation studies and real data analysis for total precipitable water vapor demonstrate that our proposed approach performs well compared with the related methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>48 pa...</summary><p>48 pages, 10 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

However, research combining AI-based weather prediction models with data assimilation remains limited partially because long-term sequential data assimilation cycles are required to evaluate data assimilation systems. This study proposes using ensemble data assimilation for diagnosing AI-based weather prediction models, and marked the first successful implementation of ensemble Kalman filter with AI-based weather prediction models. Our experiments with an AI-based model ClimaX demonstrated that the ensemble data assimilation cycled stably for the AI-based weather prediction model using covariance inflation and localization techniques within the ensemble Kalman filter. While ClimaX showed some limitations in capturing flow-dependent error covariance compared to dynamical models, the AI-based ensemble forecasts provided reasonable and beneficial error covariance in sparsely observed regions. In addition, ensemble data assimilation revealed that error growth based on ensemble ClimaX predictions was weaker than that of dynamical NWP models, leading to higher inflation factors. A series of experiments demonstrated that ensemble data assimilation can be used to diagnose properties of AI weather prediction models such as physical consistency and accurate error growth representation.</p></details> |  |

This article proposes a new one, based solely on the exploration of undisturbed observation of intersections. From them, the behavior profiles for each macro-maneuver will be discovered. Using the macro-maneuvers already identified in previous works, a comparison method between trajectories with different lengths using an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is proposed, which combined with an Expectation-Maximization (EM) inspired method, defines the different clusters that represent the behaviors observed. This is also paired with a Kullback-Liebler divergent (KL) criteria to define when the clusters need to be split or merged. Finally, the behaviors for each macro-maneuver are determined by each cluster discovered, without using any map information about the environment and being dynamically consistent with vehicle motion. By observation it becomes clear that the two main factors for driver's behavior are their assertiveness and interaction with other road users.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at IROS2024</p></details> |

We introduce the Gaussian Ensemble Belief Propagation (GEnBP) algorithm, which combines the strengths of the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) and Gaussian Belief Propagation (GaBP) to address this challenge. GEnBP updates ensembles of prior samples into posterior samples by passing low-rank local messages over the edges of a graphical model, enabling efficient handling of high-dimensional states, parameters, and complex, noisy, black-box generation processes. By utilizing local message passing within a graphical model structure, GEnBP effectively manages complex dependency structures and remains computationally efficient even when the ensemble size is much smaller than the inference dimension -- a common scenario in spatiotemporal modeling, image processing, and physical model inversion.

Our approach introduces two algorithms specifically tailored for scenarios where the cost function follows a stochastic linear model. The first algorithm is based on a Kalman filter-inspired approach, leveraging state estimation techniques to account for the presence of noise in the evolution of the objective function. The second algorithm applies $\mathcal{H}_\infty$-robust control strategies to enhance performance under uncertainty, particularly in cases in which model parameters are characterized by a high variability.

| **[Redesigning the ensemble Kalman filter with a dedicated model of epistemic uncertainty](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18864v1)** | 2024-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The problem of incorporating information from observations received serially in time is widespread in the field of uncertainty quantification. Within a probabilistic framework, such problems can be addressed using standard filtering techniques. However, in many real-world problems, some (or all) of the uncertainty is epistemic, arising from a lack of knowledge, and is difficult to model probabilistically. This paper introduces a possibilistic ensemble Kalman filter designed for this setting and characterizes some of its properties. Using possibility theory to describe epistemic uncertainty is appealing from a philosophical perspective, and it is easy to justify certain heuristics often employed in standard ensemble Kalman filters as principled approaches to capturing uncertainty within it. The possibilistic approach motivates a robust mechanism for characterizing uncertainty which shows good performance with small sample sizes, and can outperform standard ensemble Kalman filters at given sample size, even when dealing with genuinely aleatoric uncertainty.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stochastic Parameter Prediction in Cardiovascular Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18089v1)** | 2024-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Patient-specific modeling of cardiovascular flows with high-fidelity is challenging due to its dependence on accurately estimated velocity boundary profiles, which are essential for precise simulations and directly influence wall shear stress calculations - key in predicting cardiovascular diseases like atherosclerosis. This data, often derived from in vivo modalities like 4D flow MRI, suffers from low resolution and noise. To address this, we employ a stochastic data assimilation technique that integrates computational fluid dynamics with an advanced Ensemble-based Kalman filter, enhancing model accuracy while accounting for uncertainties. Our approach sequentially collects velocity data over time within the vascular model, enabling real-time refinement of unknown boundary estimations. The mathematical model uses the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation to simulate aortic blood flow. We consider unknown boundaries as constant, time-dependent, and space-time dependent in two- and three-dimensional models. In our 2-dimensional model, relative errors were as low as 0.996\% for constant boundaries and up to 2.63\% and 2.61\% for time-dependent and space-time dependent boundaries, respectively, over an observation span of two-time steps. For the 3-dimensional patient-specific model, the relative error was 7.37\% for space-time dependent boundaries. By refining the velocity boundary profile, our method improves wall shear stress predictions, enhancing the accuracy and reliability of models specific to individual cardiovascular patients. These advancements could contribute to better diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular diseases.</p></details> |  |

In a linear dynamical system with Gaussian noise distributions the KF is the optimal estimator. However, real-world systems often deviate from these assumptions. This deviation combined with the success of deep learning across many disciplines has prompted the exploration of data driven approaches that leverage deep learning for filtering applications. These learned state estimators are often reported to outperform traditional model based systems. In this work, one prevalent model, KalmanNet, was selected and evaluated on automotive radar data to assess its performance under real-world conditions and compare it to an interacting multiple models (IMM) filter. The evaluation is based on raw and normalized errors as well as the state uncertainty. The results demonstrate that KalmanNet is outperformed by the IMM filter and indicate that while data-driven methods such as KalmanNet show promise, their current lack of reliability and robustness makes them unsuited for safety-critical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 16th Symposium Sensor Data Fusion (2024)</p></details> |

The framework comprises four main components: VIO Front End, 2D Gaussian Map, NVS Loop Closure, and Dynamic Eraser. In the VIO Front End, RGB frames are processed through dense bundle adjustment and uncertainty estimation to extract scene geometry and poses. Based on this output, the mapping module incrementally constructs and maintains a 2D Gaussian map. Key components of the 2D Gaussian Map include a Sample-based Rasterizer, Score Manager, and Pose Refinement, which collectively improve mapping speed and localization accuracy. This enables the SLAM system to handle large-scale urban environments with up to 50 million Gaussian ellipsoids. To ensure global consistency in large-scale scenes, we design a Loop Closure module, which innovatively leverages the Novel View Synthesis (NVS) capabilities of Gaussian Splatting for loop closure detection and correction of the Gaussian map. Additionally, we propose a Dynamic Eraser to address the inevitable presence of dynamic objects in real-world outdoor scenes. Extensive evaluations in indoor and outdoor environments demonstrate that our approach achieves localization performance on par with Visual-Inertial Odometry while surpassing recent GS/NeRF SLAM methods. It also significantly outperforms all existing methods in terms of mapping and rendering quality. Furthermore, we developed a mobile app and verified that our framework can generate high-quality Gaussian maps in real time using only a smartphone camera and a low-frequency IMU sensor. To the best of our knowledge, VINGS-Mono is the first monocular Gaussian SLAM method capable of operating in outdoor environments and supporting kilometer-scale large scenes.</p></details> |  |

They often use SLAM approaches to build such maps. Loop closures via place recognition help maintain accurate pose estimates by mitigating global drift. This paper presents a robust loop closure detection pipeline for outdoor SLAM with LiDAR-equipped robots. The method handles various LiDAR sensors with different scanning patterns, field of views and resolutions. It generates local maps from LiDAR scans and aligns them using a ground alignment module to handle both planar and non-planar motion of the LiDAR, ensuring applicability across platforms. The method uses density-preserving bird's eye view projections of these local maps and extracts ORB feature descriptors from them for place recognition. It stores the feature descriptors in a binary search tree for efficient retrieval, and self-similarity pruning addresses perceptual aliasing in repetitive environments. Extensive experiments on public and self-recorded datasets demonstrate accurate loop closure detection, long-term localization, and cross-platform multi-map alignment, agnostic to the LiDAR scanning patterns, fields of view, and motion profiles.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Minimal Subset Approach for Efficient and Scalable Loop Closure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01791v1)** | 2025-01-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Loop closure detection in large-scale and long-term missions can be computationally demanding due to the need to identify, verify, and process numerous candidate pairs to establish edge connections for the pose graph optimization. Keyframe sampling mitigates this by reducing the number of frames stored and processed in the back-end system. In this article, we address the gap in optimized keyframe sampling for the combined problem of pose graph optimization and loop closure detection. Our Minimal Subset Approach (MSA) employs an optimization strategy with two key factors, redundancy minimization and information preservation, within a sliding window framework to efficiently reduce redundant keyframes, while preserving essential information. This method delivers comparable performance to baseline approaches, while enhancing scalability and reducing computational overhead. Finally, we evaluate MSA on relevant publicly available datasets, showcasing that it consistently performs across a wide range of environments, without requiring any manual parameter tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 8 Figures, 2 Tables.

The framework integrates a data-driven front-end for instance segmentation from either RGBD cameras or LiDARs and a custom back-end for optimizing robot trajectories and object landmarks in the map. To allow multiple robots to merge their information, we design semantics-driven place recognition algorithms that leverage the informativeness and viewpoint invariance of the object-level metric-semantic map for inter-robot loop closure detection. A communication module is designed to track each robot's observations and those of other robots whenever communication links are available. Our framework enables real-time decentralized operations onboard robots, allowing them to leverage communication opportunistically. We integrate the proposed framework with the autonomous navigation and exploration systems of three types of aerial and ground robots, conducting extensive experiments in a variety of indoor and outdoor environments. These experiments demonstrate its accuracy in inter-robot localization and object mapping, along with its moderate demands on computation, storage, and communication resources. The framework is open-sourced and is suitable for both single-agent and multi-robot metric-semantic SLAM applications.

| **[Large-Scale UWB Anchor Calibration and One-Shot Localization Using Gaussian Process](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16880v1)** | 2024-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ultra-wideband (UWB) is gaining popularity with devices like AirTags for precise home item localization but faces significant challenges when scaled to large environments like seaports. The main challenges are calibration and localization in obstructed conditions, which are common in logistics environments. Traditional calibration methods, dependent on line-of-sight (LoS), are slow, costly, and unreliable in seaports and warehouses, making large-scale localization a significant pain point in the industry. To overcome these challenges, we propose a UWB-LiDAR fusion-based calibration and one-shot localization framework. Our method uses Gaussian Processes to estimate anchor position from continuous-time LiDAR Inertial Odometry with sampled UWB ranges. This approach ensures accurate and reliable calibration with just one round of sampling in large-scale areas, I.e., 600x450 square meter. With the LoS issues, UWB-only localization can be problematic, even when anchor positions are known. We demonstrate that by applying a UWB-range filter, the search range for LiDAR loop closure descriptors is significantly reduced, improving both accuracy and speed. This concept can be applied to other loop closure detection methods, enabling cost-effective localization in large-scale warehouses and seaports. It significantly improves precision in challenging environments where UWB-only and LiDAR-Inertial methods fall short, as shown in the video \url{https://youtu.be/oY8jQKdM7lU }. We will open-source our datasets and calibration codes for community use.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICRA 2025</p></details> |

| **[SGLC: Semantic Graph-Guided Coarse-Fine-Refine Full Loop Closing for LiDAR SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08106v2)** | 2024-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Loop closing is a crucial component in SLAM that helps eliminate accumulated errors through two main steps: loop detection and loop pose correction. The first step determines whether loop closing should be performed, while the second estimates the 6-DoF pose to correct odometry drift. Current methods mostly focus on developing robust descriptors for loop closure detection, often neglecting loop pose estimation. A few methods that do include pose estimation either suffer from low accuracy or incur high computational costs. To tackle this problem, we introduce SGLC, a real-time semantic graph-guided full loop closing method, with robust loop closure detection and 6-DoF pose estimation capabilities. SGLC takes into account the distinct characteristics of foreground and background points. For foreground instances, it builds a semantic graph that not only abstracts point cloud representation for fast descriptor generation and matching but also guides the subsequent loop verification and initial pose estimation. Background points, meanwhile, are exploited to provide more geometric features for scan-wise descriptor construction and stable planar information for further pose refinement. Loop pose estimation employs a \mbox{coarse-fine-refine} registration scheme that considers the alignment of both instance points and background points, offering high efficiency and accuracy. Extensive experiments on multiple publicly available datasets demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we integrate SGLC into a SLAM system, eliminating accumulated errors and improving overall SLAM performance. The implementation of SGLC will be released at https://github.com/nubot-nudt/SGLC.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |
| **[SuperVINS: A Real-Time Visual-Inertial SLAM Framework for Challenging Imaging Conditions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21348v2)** | 2024-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The traditional visual-inertial SLAM system often struggles with stability under low-light or motion-blur conditions, leading to potential lost of trajectory tracking. High accuracy and robustness are essential for the long-term and stable localization capabilities of SLAM systems. Addressing the challenges of enhancing robustness and accuracy in visual-inertial SLAM, this paper propose SuperVINS, a real-time visual-inertial SLAM framework designed for challenging imaging conditions. In contrast to geometric modeling, deep learning features are capable of fully leveraging the implicit information present in images, which is often not captured by geometric features. Therefore, SuperVINS, developed as an enhancement of VINS-Fusion, integrates the deep learning neural network model SuperPoint for feature point extraction and loop closure detection. At the same time, a deep learning neural network LightGlue model for associating feature points is integrated in front-end feature matching. A feature matching enhancement strategy based on the RANSAC algorithm is proposed. The system is allowed to set different masks and RANSAC thresholds for various environments, thereby balancing computational cost and localization accuracy. Additionally, it allows for flexible training of specific SuperPoint bag of words tailored for loop closure detection in particular environments. The system enables real-time localization and mapping. Experimental validation on the well-known EuRoC dataset demonstrates that SuperVINS is comparable to other visual-inertial SLAM system in accuracy and robustness across the most challenging sequences. This paper analyzes the advantages of SuperVINS in terms of accuracy, real-time performance, and robustness. To facilitate knowledge exchange within the field, we have made the code for this paper publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Voxel-SLAM: A Complete, Accurate, and Versatile LiDAR-Inertial SLAM System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08935v1)** | 2024-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we present Voxel-SLAM: a complete, accurate, and versatile LiDAR-inertial SLAM system that fully utilizes short-term, mid-term, long-term, and multi-map data associations to achieve real-time estimation and high precision mapping. The system consists of five modules: initialization, odometry, local mapping, loop closure, and global mapping, all employing the same map representation, an adaptive voxel map. The initialization provides an accurate initial state estimation and a consistent local map for subsequent modules, enabling the system to start with a highly dynamic initial state. The odometry, exploiting the short-term data association, rapidly estimates current states and detects potential system divergence. The local mapping, exploiting the mid-term data association, employs a local LiDAR-inertial bundle adjustment (BA) to refine the states (and the local map) within a sliding window of recent LiDAR scans. The loop closure detects previously visited places in the current and all previous sessions. The global mapping refines the global map with an efficient hierarchical global BA. The loop closure and global mapping both exploit long-term and multi-map data associations. We conducted a comprehensive benchmark comparison with other state-of-the-art methods across 30 sequences from three representative scenes, including narrow indoor environments using hand-held equipment, large-scale wilderness environments with aerial robots, and urban environments on vehicle platforms. Other experiments demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of the initialization, the capacity to work in multiple sessions, and relocalization in degenerated environments.</p></details> |  |

Current SLAM systems can achieve centimeter-level accuracy within a short period. However, there are still several challenges when dealing with largescale mapping tasks including significant storage requirements and difficulty of reusing the constructed maps. To address this, we first design an elastic and lightweight map representation called CELLmap, composed of several CELLs, each representing the local map at the corresponding location. Then, we design a general backend including CELL-based bidirectional registration module and loop closure detection module to improve global map consistency. Our experiments have demonstrated that CELLmap can represent the precise geometric structure of large-scale maps of KITTI dataset using only about 60 MB. Additionally, our general backend achieves up to a 26.88% improvement over various LiDAR odometry methods.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Open-Set Semantic Uncertainty Aware Metric-Semantic Graph Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11555v1)** | 2024-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Underwater object-level mapping requires incorporating visual foundation models to handle the uncommon and often previously unseen object classes encountered in marine scenarios. In this work, a metric of semantic uncertainty for open-set object detections produced by visual foundation models is calculated and then incorporated into an object-level uncertainty tracking framework. Object-level uncertainties and geometric relationships between objects are used to enable robust object-level loop closure detection for unknown object classes. The above loop closure detection problem is formulated as a graph-matching problem. While graph matching, in general, is NP-Complete, a solver for an equivalent formulation of the proposed graph matching problem as a graph editing problem is tested on multiple challenging underwater scenes. Results for this solver as well as three other solvers demonstrate that the proposed methods are feasible for real-time use in marine environments for the robust, open-set, multi-object, semantic-uncertainty-aware loop closure detection. Further experimental results on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that the method generalizes to large-scale terrestrial scenes.</p></details> |  |

This approach boils down to sequential loop-closure detection and decision-making, based on the current pose state estimate and the magnetic field. We combine this setup with a path estimation framework using an extended Kalman smoother which fuses the odometry increments with the detected loop-closure timings. We demonstrate the practical applicability of the model with several different real-world examples from a handheld iPad moving in indoor scenes.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in International Conference on Multisensor Fusion and Integration for Intelligent Systems (MFI) 2024</p></details> |
| **[BEVPlace++: Fast, Robust, and Lightweight LiDAR Global Localization for Unmanned Ground Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01841v2)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This article introduces BEVPlace++, a novel, fast, and robust LiDAR global localization method for unmanned ground vehicles. It uses lightweight convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on Bird's Eye View (BEV) image-like representations of LiDAR data to achieve accurate global localization through place recognition followed by 3-DoF pose estimation. Our detailed analyses reveal an interesting fact that CNNs are inherently effective at extracting distinctive features from LiDAR BEV images. Remarkably, keypoints of two BEV images with large translations can be effectively matched using CNN-extracted features. Building on this insight, we design a rotation equivariant module (REM) to obtain distinctive features while enhancing robustness to rotational changes. A Rotation Equivariant and Invariant Network (REIN) is then developed by cascading REM and a descriptor generator, NetVLAD, to sequentially generate rotation equivariant local features and rotation invariant global descriptors. The global descriptors are used first to achieve robust place recognition, and the local features are used for accurate pose estimation. Experimental results on multiple public datasets demonstrate that BEVPlace++, even when trained on a small dataset (3000 frames of KITTI) only with place labels, generalizes well to unseen environments, performs consistently across different days and years, and adapts to various types of LiDAR scanners. BEVPlace++ achieves state-of-the-art performance in subtasks of global localization including place recognition, loop closure detection, and global localization. Additionally, BEVPlace++ is lightweight, runs in real-time, and does not require accurate pose supervision, making it highly convenient for deployment.

| **[Active Loop Closure for OSM-guided Robotic Mapping in Large-Scale Urban Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17078v1)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The autonomous mapping of large-scale urban scenes presents significant challenges for autonomous robots. To mitigate the challenges, global planning, such as utilizing prior GPS trajectories from OpenStreetMap (OSM), is often used to guide the autonomous navigation of robots for mapping. However, due to factors like complex terrain, unexpected body movement, and sensor noise, the uncertainty of the robot's pose estimates inevitably increases over time, ultimately leading to the failure of robotic mapping. To address this issue, we propose a novel active loop closure procedure, enabling the robot to actively re-plan the previously planned GPS trajectory. The method can guide the robot to re-visit the previous places where the loop-closure detection can be performed to trigger the back-end optimization, effectively reducing errors and uncertainties in pose estimation. The proposed active loop closure mechanism is implemented and embedded into a real-time OSM-guided robot mapping framework. Empirical results on several large-scale outdoor scenarios demonstrate its effectiveness and promising performance.</p></details> |  |

However, online processing for global loop closure detection approaches is generally influenced by the size of the environment.

As the size of the internal map increases, so does the time required to compare new observations with all stored locations, eventually limiting online processing. This paper presents an online loop closure detection approach for large-scale and long-term operation. The approach is based on a memory management method, which limits the number of locations used for loop closure detection so that the computation time remains under real-time constraints. The idea consists of keeping the most recent and frequently observed locations in a Working Memory (WM) used for loop closure detection, and transferring the others into a Long-Term Memory (LTM). When a match is found between the current location and one stored in WM, associated locations stored in LTM can be updated and remembered for additional loop closure detections. Results demonstrate the approach's adaptability and scalability using ten standard data sets from other appearance-based loop closure approaches, one custom data set using real images taken over a 2 km loop of our university campus, and one custom data set (7 hours) using virtual images from the racing video game ``Need for Speed: Most Wanted''.</p></details> | 12 pages, 11 figures |

Loop closures correct drifts in trajectory estimation to build a globally consistent map. However, a false loop closure can be fatal, so verification is required as an additional step to ensure robustness by rejecting the false positive loops. Geometric verification has been a well-acknowledged solution that leverages spatial clues provided by local feature matching to find true positives. Existing feature matching methods focus on homography and pose estimation in long-term visual localization, lacking references for geometric verification. To fill the gap, this paper proposes a unified benchmark targeting geometric verification of loop closure detection under long-term conditional variations. Furthermore, we evaluate six representative local feature matching methods (handcrafted and learning-based) under the benchmark, with in-depth analysis for limitations and future directions.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 11 figures, Accepted by IROS(2024)</p></details> |

Although deep learning-based local features excel at capturing high-level information and perform well on matching benchmarks, they struggle with generalization in continuous motion scenes, adversely affecting loop detection accuracy. Our system employs a Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) strategy to optimize the training of keypoint extraction networks, enhancing their adaptability to diverse environments. Additionally, we introduce a coarse-to-fine feature tracking mechanism for learned keypoints. It begins with a direct method to approximate the relative pose between consecutive frames, followed by a feature matching method for refined pose estimation. To mitigate cumulative positioning errors, DK-SLAM incorporates a novel online learning module that utilizes binary features for loop closure detection. This module dynamically identifies loop nodes within a sequence, ensuring accurate and efficient localization. Experimental evaluations on publicly available datasets demonstrate that DK-SLAM outperforms leading traditional and learning based SLAM systems, such as ORB-SLAM3 and LIFT-SLAM.

Current range image-based networks use single-column convolution to maintain feature invariance to shifts in image columns caused by LiDAR viewpoint change.However, this raises the issues such as "restricted receptive fields" and "excessive focus on local regions", degrading the performance of networks. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a lightweight circular convolutional Transformer network denoted as CCTNet, which boosts performance by capturing structural information in point clouds and facilitating crossdimensional interaction of spatial and channel information. Initially, a Circular Convolution Module (CCM) is introduced, expanding the network's perceptual field while maintaining feature consistency across varying LiDAR perspectives. Then, a Range Transformer Module (RTM) is proposed, which enhances place recognition accuracy in scenarios with movable objects by employing a combination of channel and spatial attention mechanisms. Furthermore, we propose an Overlap-based loss function, transforming the place recognition task from a binary loop closure classification into a regression problem linked to the overlap between LiDAR frames. Through extensive experiments on the KITTI and Ford Campus datasets, CCTNet surpasses comparable methods, achieving Recall@1 of 0.924 and 0.965, and Recall@1% of 0.990 and 0.993 on the test set, showcasing a superior performance. Results on the selfcollected dataset further demonstrate the proposed method's potential for practical implementation in complex scenarios to handle movable objects, showing improved generalization in various datasets.</p></details> |  |

It is also crucial in tasks such as loop closure detection and global localization within SLAM. Previous methods utilize mundane point cloud representations as input and deep learning-based LiDAR-based Place Recognition (LPR) approaches employing different point cloud image inputs with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or transformer architectures. However, the recently proposed Mamba deep learning model, combined with state space models (SSMs), holds great potential for long sequence modeling. Therefore, we developed OverlapMamba, a novel network for place recognition, which represents input range views (RVs) as sequences. In a novel way, we employ a stochastic reconstruction approach to build shift state space models, compressing the visual representation. Evaluated on three different public datasets, our method effectively detects loop closures, showing robustness even when traversing previously visited locations from different directions. Relying on raw range view inputs, it outperforms typical LiDAR and multi-view combination methods in time complexity and speed, indicating strong place recognition capabilities and real-time efficiency.</p></details> |  |

However, the utilization of 2D LiDAR in Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) frequently encounters challenges related to motion degeneracy, particularly in geometrically similar environments. To address this problem, this paper proposes a robust, accurate, and multi-sensor-fused 2D LiDAR SLAM system specifically designed for indoor mobile robots. To commence, the original LiDAR data undergoes meticulous processing through point and line extraction. Leveraging the distinctive characteristics of indoor environments, line-line constraints are established to complement other sensor data effectively, thereby augmenting the overall robustness and precision of the system. Concurrently, a tightly-coupled front-end is created, integrating data from the 2D LiDAR, IMU, and wheel odometry, thus enabling real-time state estimation. Building upon this solid foundation, a novel global feature point matching-based loop closure detection algorithm is proposed. This algorithm proves highly effective in mitigating front-end accumulated errors and ultimately constructs a globally consistent map. The experimental results indicate that our system fully meets real-time requirements. When compared to Cartographer, our system not only exhibits lower trajectory errors but also demonstrates stronger robustness, particularly in degeneracy problem.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by Measurement Science and Technology: https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6501/ad3ea3/meta</p></details> |

This article investigates the use of 4D imaging radars for SLAM and analyzes the challenges in robust loop closure. Previous work indicates that 4D radars, together with inertial measurements, offer ample information for accurate odometry estimation. However, the low field of view, limited resolution, and sparse and noisy measurements render loop closure a significantly more challenging problem. Our work builds on the previous work - TBV SLAM - which was proposed for robust loop closure with 360$^\circ$ spinning radars. This article highlights and addresses challenges inherited from a directional 4D radar, such as sparsity, noise, and reduced field of view, and discusses why the common definition of a loop closure is unsuitable. By combining multiple quality measures for accurate loop closure detection adapted to 4D radar data, significant results in trajectory estimation are achieved; the absolute trajectory error is as low as 0.46 m over a distance of 1.8 km, with consistent operation over multiple environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the workshop "Radar in Robotics: Resilience from Signal to Navigation" at ICRA 2024</p></details> |

Existing research on lidar-based loop closure heavily relies on dense point cloud and 360 FOV lidars. This paper proposes an out-of-the-box NDT (Normal Distribution Transform) based global descriptor, NDT-Map-Code, designed for both on-road driving and underground valet parking scenarios. NDT-Map-Code can be directly extracted from the NDT map without the need for a dense point cloud, resulting in excellent scalability and low maintenance cost. The NDT representation is leveraged to identify representative patterns, which are further encoded according to their spatial location (bearing, range, and height). Experimental results on the NIO underground parking lot dataset and the KITTI dataset demonstrate that our method achieves significantly better performance compared to the state-of-the-art.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[RTAB-Map as an Open-Source Lidar and Visual SLAM Library for Large-Scale and Long-Term Online Operation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06341v1)** | 2024-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distributed as an open source library since 2013, RTAB-Map started as an appearance-based loop closure detection approach with memory management to deal with large-scale and long-term online operation. It then grew to implement Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) on various robots and mobile platforms. As each application brings its own set of contraints on sensors, processing capabilities and locomotion, it raises the question of which SLAM approach is the most appropriate to use in terms of cost, accuracy, computation power and ease of integration. Since most of SLAM approaches are either visual or lidar-based, comparison is difficult. Therefore, we decided to extend RTAB-Map to support both visual and lidar SLAM, providing in one package a tool allowing users to implement and compare a variety of 3D and 2D solutions for a wide range of applications with different robots and sensors. This paper presents this extended version of RTAB-Map and its use in comparing, both quantitatively and qualitatively, a large selection of popular real-world datasets (e.g., KITTI, EuRoC, TUM RGB-D, MIT Stata Center on PR2 robot), outlining strengths and limitations of visual and lidar SLAM configurations from a practical perspective for autonomous navigation applications.</p></details> | 40 pages, 19 figures |
| **[mmPlace: Robust Place Recognition with Intermediate Frequency Signal of Low-cost Single-chip Millimeter Wave Radar](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04703v1)** | 2024-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Place recognition is crucial for tasks like loop-closure detection and re-localization. Single-chip millimeter wave radar (single-chip radar in short) emerges as a low-cost sensor option for place recognition, with the advantage of insensitivity to degraded visual environments. However, it encounters two challenges. Firstly, sparse point cloud from single-chip radar leads to poor performance when using current place recognition methods, which assume much denser data. Secondly, its performance significantly declines in scenarios involving rotational and lateral variations, due to limited overlap in its field of view (FOV). We propose mmPlace, a robust place recognition system to address these challenges. Specifically, mmPlace transforms intermediate frequency (IF) signal into range azimuth heatmap and employs a spatial encoder to extract features. Additionally, to improve the performance in scenarios involving rotational and lateral variations, mmPlace employs a rotating platform and concatenates heatmaps in a rotation cycle, effectively expanding the system's FOV. We evaluate mmPlace's performance on the milliSonic dataset, which is collected on the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) campus, the city roads surrounding the campus, and an underground parking garage. The results demonstrate that mmPlace outperforms point cloud-based methods and achieves 87.37% recall@1 in scenarios involving rotational and lateral variations.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |

In particular, orchards are a difficult case study due to structural similarity across the entire field. In this work, we address the place recognition problem in orchards resorting to 3D LiDAR data, which is considered a key modality for robustness. Hence, we propose ORCHNet, a deep-learning-based approach that maps 3D-LiDAR scans to global descriptors. Specifically, this work proposes a new global feature aggregation approach, which fuses multiple aggregation methods into a robust global descriptor. ORCHNet is evaluated on real-world data collected in orchards, comprising data from the summer and autumn seasons. To assess the robustness, we compare ORCHNet with state-of-the-art aggregation approaches on data from the same season and across seasons. Moreover, we additionally evaluate the proposed approach as part of a localization framework, where ORCHNet is used as a loop closure detector. The empirical results indicate that, on the place recognition task, ORCHNet outperforms the remaining approaches, and is also more robust across seasons. As for the localization, the edge cases where the path goes through the trees are solved when integrating ORCHNet as a loop detector, showing the potential applicability of the proposed approach in this task.

Brains also appear to learn maps, but the mechanisms are not known and it is unclear how to infer these maps from neural activity data. We present BrainSLAM; a method for performing SLAM using only population activity (local field potential, LFP) data simultaneously recorded from three brain regions in rats: hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and parietal cortex. This system uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to decode velocity and familiarity information from wavelet scalograms of neural local field potential data recorded from rats as they navigate a 2D maze. The CNN's output drives a RatSLAM-inspired architecture, powering an attractor network which performs path integration plus a separate system which performs `loop closure' (detecting previously visited locations and correcting map aliasing errors). Together, these three components can construct faithful representations of the environment while simultaneously tracking the animal's location. This is the first demonstration of inference of a spatial map from brain recordings. Our findings expand SLAM to a new modality, enabling a new method of mapping environments and facilitating a better understanding of the role of cognitive maps in navigation and decision making.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 23rd International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems. 2024</p></details> |
| **[Attacking the Loop: Adversarial Attacks on Graph-based Loop Closure Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06991v1)** | 2023-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the advancement in robotics, it is becoming increasingly common for large factories and warehouses to incorporate visual SLAM (vSLAM) enabled automated robots that operate closely next to humans. This makes any adversarial attacks on vSLAM components potentially detrimental to humans working alongside them. Loop Closure Detection (LCD) is a crucial component in vSLAM that minimizes the accumulation of drift in mapping, since even a small drift can accumulate into a significant drift over time. A prior work by Kim et al., SymbioLCD2, unified visual features and semantic objects into a single graph structure for finding loop closure candidates. While this provided a performance improvement over visual feature-based LCD, it also created a single point of vulnerability for potential graph-based adversarial attacks. Unlike previously reported visual-patch based attacks, small graph perturbations are far more challenging to detect, making them a more significant threat. In this paper, we present Adversarial-LCD, a novel black-box evasion attack framework that employs an eigencentrality-based perturbation method and an SVM-RBF surrogate model with a Weisfeiler-Lehman feature extractor for attacking graph-based LCD. Our evaluation shows that the attack performance of Adversarial-LCD with the SVM-RBF surrogate model was superior to that of other machine learning surrogate algorithms, including SVM-linear, SVM-polynomial, and Bayesian classifier, demonstrating the effectiveness of our attack framework. Furthermore, we show that our eigencentrality-based perturbation method outperforms other algorithms, such as Random-walk and Shortest-path, highlighting the efficiency of Adversarial-LCD's perturbation selection method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at VISIGRAPP 2024, 8 pages</p></details> |
| **[Towards Accurate Loop Closure Detection in Semantic SLAM with 3D Semantic Covisibility Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12245v1)** | 2023-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Loop closure is necessary for correcting errors accumulated in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) in unknown environments. However, conventional loop closure methods based on low-level geometric or image features may cause high ambiguity by not distinguishing similar scenarios. Thus, incorrect loop closures can occur. Though semantic 2D image information is considered in some literature to detect loop closures, there is little work that compares 3D scenes as an integral part of a semantic SLAM system. This paper introduces an approach, called SmSLAM+LCD, integrated into a semantic SLAM system to combine high-level 3D semantic information and low-level feature information to conduct accurate loop closure detection and effective drift reduction. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated in testing results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Outram: One-shot Global Localization via Triangulated Scene Graph and Global Outlier Pruning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08914v1)** | 2023-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One-shot LiDAR localization refers to the ability to estimate the robot pose from one single point cloud, which yields significant advantages in initialization and relocalization processes. In the point cloud domain, the topic has been extensively studied as a global descriptor retrieval (i.e., loop closure detection) and pose refinement (i.e., point cloud registration) problem both in isolation or combined. However, few have explicitly considered the relationship between candidate retrieval and correspondence generation in pose estimation, leaving them brittle to substructure ambiguities. To this end, we propose a hierarchical one-shot localization algorithm called Outram that leverages substructures of 3D scene graphs for locally consistent correspondence searching and global substructure-wise outlier pruning. Such a hierarchical process couples the feature retrieval and the correspondence extraction to resolve the substructure ambiguities by conducting a local-to-global consistency refinement. We demonstrate the capability of Outram in a variety of scenarios in multiple large-scale outdoor datasets. Our implementation is open-sourced: https://github.com/Pamphlett/Outram.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

These applications encompass object recognition, image retrieval, and video analysis. LCD consists in identifying whether a robot has returned to a previously visited location, referred to as a loop, and then estimating the related roto-translation with respect to the analyzed location. Despite the numerous advantages of radar sensors, such as their ability to operate under diverse weather conditions and provide a wider range of view compared to other commonly used sensors (e.g., cameras or LiDARs), integrating radar data remains an arduous task due to intrinsic noise and distortion. To address this challenge, this research introduces RadarLCD, a novel supervised deep learning pipeline specifically designed for Loop Closure Detection using the FMCW Radar (Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave) sensor. RadarLCD, a learning-based LCD methodology explicitly designed for radar systems, makes a significant contribution by leveraging the pre-trained HERO (Hybrid Estimation Radar Odometry) model. Being originally developed for radar odometry, HERO's features are used to select key points crucial for LCD tasks. The methodology undergoes evaluation across a variety of FMCW Radar dataset scenes, and it is compared to state-of-the-art systems such as Scan Context for Place Recognition and ICP for Loop Closure. The results demonstrate that RadarLCD surpasses the alternatives in multiple aspects of Loop Closure Detection.</p></details> | 7 pages, 2 figures |

As a result of these disruptions, pervasive in indoor spaces, magnetic field data is often omitted from navigation algorithms in indoor environments. This paper leverages the spatially-varying disruptions to Earth's magnetic field to extract positional information for use in indoor navigation algorithms. The algorithm uses a rate gyro and an array of four magnetometers to estimate the robot's pose. Additionally, the magnetometer array is used to compute attitude-invariant measurements associated with the magnetic field and its gradient. These measurements are used to detect loop closure points. Experimental results indicate that the proposed approach can estimate the pose of a ground robot in an indoor environment within meter accuracy.</p></details> |  |

But the LiDAR-SLAM could be disturbed by current scene moving objects, resulting in drift errors and even loop-closure failure. Thus, the ability to detect and segment moving objects is essential for high-precision positioning and building a consistent map. In this paper, we address the problem of moving object segmentation from 3D LiDAR scans to improve the odometry and loop-closure accuracy of SLAM. We propose a novel 3D Sequential Moving-Object-Segmentation (3D-SeqMOS) method that can accurately segment the scene into moving and static objects, such as moving and static cars. Different from the existing projected-image method, we process the raw 3D point cloud and build a 3D convolution neural network for MOS task. In addition, to make full use of the spatio-temporal information of point cloud, we propose a point cloud residual mechanism using the spatial features of current scan and the temporal features of previous residual scans. Besides, we build a complete SLAM framework to verify the effectiveness and accuracy of 3D-SeqMOS. Experiments on SemanticKITTI dataset show that our proposed 3D-SeqMOS method can effectively detect moving objects and improve the accuracy of LiDAR odometry and loop-closure detection. The test results show our 3D-SeqMOS outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 12.4%. We extend the proposed method to the SemanticKITTI: Moving Object Segmentation competition and achieve the 2nd in the leaderboard, showing its effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present a novel radar-only place recognition that measures the similarity score by utilizing Radon-transformed sinogram images and cross-correlation in frequency domain. Doing so achieves rigid transform invariance during place recognition, while ignoring the effects of radar multipath and ring noises. In addition, we compute the radar similarity distance using mutable threshold to mitigate variability of the similarity score, and reduce the time complexity of processing a copious radar data with hierarchical retrieval. We demonstrate the matching performance for both intra-session loop-closure detection and global place recognition using a publicly available imaging radar datasets. We verify reliable performance compared to existing stable radar place recognition method. Furthermore, codes for the proposed imaging radar place recognition is released for community.</p></details> |  |

Traditional large-scale map merging methods are fragile to incorrect data associations, and are primarily limited to working only offline. AutoMerge utilizes multi-perspective fusion and adaptive loop closure detection for accurate data associations, and it uses incremental merging to assemble large maps from individual trajectory segments given in random order and with no initial estimations. Furthermore, after assembling the segments, AutoMerge performs fine matching and pose-graph optimization to globally smooth the merged map. We demonstrate AutoMerge on both city-scale merging (120km) and campus-scale repeated merging (4.5km x 8). The experiments show that AutoMerge (i) surpasses the second- and third- best methods by 14% and 24% recall in segment retrieval, (ii) achieves comparable 3D mapping accuracy for 120 km large-scale map assembly, (iii) and it is robust to temporally-spaced revisits. To the best of our knowledge, AutoMerge is the first mapping approach that can merge hundreds of kilometers of individual segments without the aid of GPS.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 20 figures, IEEE Transactions on Robotics (T-RO) 2023</p></details> |

It enables the recognition of previously visited scenes to eliminate pose and map estimate drifts arising from long-term exploration. However, current appearance-based LCD methods face significant challenges, including high computational costs, viewpoint variance, and dynamic objects in scenes. This paper introduced an online appearance based LCD using local superpixel grids descriptor and dynamic node, i.e, LSGDDN-LCD, to find similarities between scenes via hand-crafted features extracted from LSGD. Unlike traditional Bag-of-Words (BoW) based LCD, which requires pre-training, we proposed an adaptive mechanism to group similar images called $\textbf{\textit{dynamic}}$ $\textbf{\textit{node}}$, which incrementally adjusted the database in an online manner, allowing for efficient and online retrieval of previously viewed images without need of the pre-training. Experimental results confirmed that the LSGDDN-LCD significantly improved LCD precision-recall and efficiency, and outperformed several state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches on multiple typical datasets, indicating its great potential as a generic LCD framework.</p></details> |  |

Recently, 3D LiDAR-based localization methods have used retrieval-based place recognition to find revisited places efficiently. However, when deployed in challenging real-world scenarios, the place recognition models become more complex, which comes at the cost of high computational demand. This work tackles this problem from an information-retrieval perspective, adopting a first-retrieve-then-re-ranking paradigm, where an initial loop candidate ranking, generated from a 3D place recognition model, is re-ordered by a proposed lightweight transformer-based re-ranking approach (TReR). The proposed approach relies on global descriptors only, being agnostic to the place recognition model. The experimental evaluation, conducted on the KITTI Odometry dataset, where we compared TReR with s.o.t.a. re-ranking approaches such as alphaQE and SGV, indicate the robustness and efficiency when compared to alphaQE while offering a good trade-off between robustness and efficiency when compared to SGV.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This preprint has been submitted to 26th IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems ITSC 2023</p></details> |
| **[Foundations of Spatial Perception for Robotics: Hierarchical Representations and Real-time Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07154v1)** | 2023-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D spatial perception is the problem of building and maintaining an actionable and persistent representation of the environment in real-time using sensor data and prior knowledge. Despite the fast-paced progress in robot perception, most existing methods either build purely geometric maps (as in traditional SLAM) or flat metric-semantic maps that do not scale to large environments or large dictionaries of semantic labels. The first part of this paper is concerned with representations: we show that scalable representations for spatial perception need to be hierarchical in nature. Hierarchical representations are efficient to store, and lead to layered graphs with small treewidth, which enable provably efficient inference. We then introduce an example of hierarchical representation for indoor environments, namely a 3D scene graph, and discuss its structure and properties. The second part of the paper focuses on algorithms to incrementally construct a 3D scene graph as the robot explores the environment. Our algorithms combine 3D geometry, topology (to cluster the places into rooms), and geometric deep learning (e.g., to classify the type of rooms the robot is moving across). The third part of the paper focuses on algorithms to maintain and correct 3D scene graphs during long-term operation. We propose hierarchical descriptors for loop closure detection and describe how to correct a scene graph in response to loop closures, by solving a 3D scene graph optimization problem. We conclude the paper by combining the proposed perception algorithms into Hydra, a real-time spatial perception system that builds a 3D scene graph from visual-inertial data in real-time. We showcase Hydra's performance in photo-realistic simulations and real data collected by a Clearpath Jackal robots and a Unitree A1 robot.

This paper describes Hydra-Multi, the first multi-robot spatial perception system capable of constructing a multi-robot 3D scene graph online from sensor data collected by robots in a team. In particular, we develop a centralized system capable of constructing a joint 3D scene graph by taking incremental inputs from multiple robots, effectively finding the relative transforms between the robots' frames, and incorporating loop closure detections to correctly reconcile the scene graph nodes from different robots. We evaluate Hydra-Multi on simulated and real scenarios and show it is able to reconstruct accurate 3D scene graphs online. We also demonstrate Hydra-Multi's capability of supporting heterogeneous teams by fusing different map representations built by robots with different sensor suites.</p></details> | 8 pages, 10 figures |

In this paper, we present an object-based loop closure detection method based on the spatial layout and semanic consistency of the 3D scene graph. Firstly, we propose an object-level data association approach based on the semantic information from semantic labels, intersection over union (IoU), object color, and object embedding. Subsequently, multi-view bundle adjustment with the associated objects is utilized to jointly optimize the poses of objects and cameras. We represent the refined objects as a 3D spatial graph with semantics and topology. Then, we propose a graph matching approach to select correspondence objects based on the structure layout and semantic property similarity of vertices' neighbors. Finally, we jointly optimize camera trajectories and object poses in an object-level pose graph optimization, which results in a globally consistent map. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed data association approach can construct more accurate 3D semantic maps, and our loop closure method is more robust than point-based and object-based methods in circumstances with large viewpoint changes.</p></details> |  |

Most LiDAR-based methods achieve this goal by using only the geometric information, disregarding the semantics of the scene. In this work, we introduce PADLoC for joint loop closure detection and registration in LiDAR-based SLAM frameworks. We propose a novel transformer-based head for point cloud matching and registration, and to leverage panoptic information during training time. In particular, we propose a novel loss function that reframes the matching problem as a classification task for the semantic labels and as a graph connectivity assignment for the instance labels. During inference, PADLoC does not require panoptic annotations, making it more versatile than other methods. Additionally, we show that using two shared matching and registration heads with their source and target inputs swapped increases the overall performance by enforcing forward-backward consistency.

| **[Optimized SC-F-LOAM: Optimized Fast LiDAR Odometry and Mapping Using Scan Context](http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.04932v2)** | 2023-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR odometry can achieve accurate vehicle pose estimation for short driving range or in small-scale environments, but for long driving range or in large-scale environments, the accuracy deteriorates as a result of cumulative estimation errors. This drawback necessitates the inclusion of loop closure detection in a SLAM framework to suppress the adverse effects of cumulative errors. To improve the accuracy of pose estimation, we propose a new LiDAR-based SLAM method which uses F-LOAM as LiDAR odometry, Scan Context for loop closure detection, and GTSAM for global optimization. In our approach, an adaptive distance threshold (instead of a fixed threshold) is employed for loop closure detection, which achieves more accurate loop closure detection results. Besides, a feature-based matching method is used in our approach to compute vehicle pose transformations between loop closure point cloud pairs, instead of using the raw point cloud obtained by the LiDAR sensor, which significantly reduces the computation time. The KITTI dataset is used for verifications of our method, and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms typical LiDAR odometry/SLAM methods in the literature. Our code is made publicly available for the benefit of the community.</p></details> |  |

Natural and unstructured environments present many additional challenges for the tasks of long-term localisation but these environments are not represented in currently available datasets. To address this we introduce Wild-Places, a challenging large-scale dataset for lidar place recognition in unstructured, natural environments. Wild-Places contains eight lidar sequences collected with a handheld sensor payload over the course of fourteen months, containing a total of 63K undistorted lidar submaps along with accurate 6DoF ground truth. Our dataset contains multiple revisits both within and between sequences, allowing for both intra-sequence (i.e. loop closure detection) and inter-sequence (i.e. re-localisation) place recognition. We also benchmark several state-of-the-art approaches to demonstrate the challenges that this dataset introduces, particularly the case of long-term place recognition due to natural environments changing over time. Our dataset and code will be available at https://csiro-robotics.github.io/Wild-Places.</p></details> | <details><summary>Equal...</summary><p>Equal Contribution from first two authors Accepted to ICRA2023 Website link: https://csiro-robotics.github.io/Wild-Places/</p></details> |
| **[Region Prediction for Efficient Robot Localization on Large Maps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00295v1)** | 2023-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recognizing already explored places (a.k.a. place recognition) is a fundamental task in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) to enable robot relocalization and loop closure detection. In topological SLAM the recognition takes place by comparing a signature (or feature vector) associated to the current node with the signatures of the nodes in the known map. However, as the number of nodes increases, matching the current node signature against all the existing ones becomes inefficient and thwarts real-time navigation. In this paper we propose a novel approach to pre-select a subset of map nodes for place recognition. The map nodes are clustered during exploration and each cluster is associated with a region. The region labels become the prediction targets of a deep neural network and, during navigation, only the nodes associated with the regions predicted with high probability are considered for matching. While the proposed technique can be integrated in different SLAM approaches, in this work we describe an effective integration with RTAB-Map (a popular framework for real-time topological SLAM) which allowed us to design and run several experiments to demonstrate its effectiveness. All the code and material from the experiments will be available online at https://github.com/MI-BioLab/region-learner.</p></details> |  |

Integrating the Ultra-Wideband(UWB) technique has been shown to correct the long-term estimation drift and bypass the complexity of loop closure detection. However, few works on robotics adopt UWB as a stand-alone state estimation solution. The primary purpose of this work is to investigate planar pose estimation using only UWB range measurements and study the estimator's statistical efficiency. We prove the excellent property of a two-step scheme, which says that we can refine a consistent estimator to be asymptotically efficient by one step of Gauss-Newton iteration. Grounded on this result, we design the GN-ULS estimator and evaluate it through simulations and collected datasets. GN-ULS attains millimeter and sub-degree level accuracy on our static datasets and attains centimeter and degree level accuracy on our dynamic datasets, presenting the possibility of using only UWB for real-time state estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Update the content and improve consistency with the ICRA version</p></details> |

We interpret the Cartesian birds' eye view (BEV) image projected from 3D LiDAR points as layered distribution of structures. To recover elevation information from BEVs, we slice them at different heights, and connected pixels at each level will form contours. Each contour is parameterized by abstract information, e.g., pixel count, center position, covariance, and mean height. The similarity of two BEVs is calculated in sequential discrete and continuous steps. The first step considers the geometric consensus of graph-like constellations formed by contours in particular localities. The second step models the majority of contours as a 2.5D Gaussian mixture model, which is used to calculate correlation and optimize relative transform in continuous space. A retrieval key is designed to accelerate the search of a database indexed by layered KD-trees. We validate the efficacy of our method by comparing it with recent works on public datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 7 figures, accepted by ICRA 2023</p></details> |

Our proposed SLAM system is consist of visual-inertial odometry (VIO) and LiDAR inertial odometry (LIO) subsystems. We propose the LIO subsystem utilizing the measurement from the LiDAR and the inertial sensors to build the local odometry map, and propose the VIO subsystem which takes in the visual information to construct the 2D-3D associated map. Then, we propose an iterative Kalman Filter-based optimization function to optimize the local project-based 2D-to-3D photo-metric error between the projected image pixels and the local 3D points to make the robust 2D-3D alignment. Finally, we have also proposed the back-end pose graph global optimization and the elaborately designed loop closure detection network to improve the accuracy of the whole SLAM system.

Existing tactile surface reconstruction methods rely on external sensors or have strong prior assumptions, making the operation complex and limiting their application scenarios. This paper presents a framework for low-drift surface reconstruction through multiple tactile measurements, Tac2Structure. Compared with existing algorithms, the proposed method uses only a new vision-based tactile sensor without relying on external devices. Aiming at the difficulty that reconstruction accuracy is easily affected by the pressure at contact, we propose a correction algorithm to adapt it. The proposed method also reduces the accumulative errors that occur easily during global object surface reconstruction. Multi-frame tactile measurements can accurately reconstruct object surfaces by jointly using the point cloud registration algorithm, loop-closure detection algorithm based on deep learning, and pose graph optimization algorithm. Experiments verify that Tac2Structure can achieve millimeter-level accuracy in reconstructing the surface of objects, providing accurate tactile information for the robot to perceive the surrounding environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Robotics And Automation Letters</p></details> |

With the success of DL approaches in learning useful information from 3D LiDARs, place recognition has also benefited from this modality, which has led to higher re-localization and loop-closure detection performance, particularly, in environments with significant changing conditions. Despite the progress in this field, the extraction of proper and efficient descriptors from 3D LiDAR data that are invariant to changing conditions and orientation is still an unsolved challenge. To address this problem, this work proposes a novel 3D LiDAR-based deep learning network (named AttDLNet) that uses a range-based proxy representation for point clouds and an attention network with stacked attention layers to selectively focus on long-range context and inter-feature relationships. The proposed network is trained and validated on the KITTI dataset and an ablation study is presented to assess the novel attention network. Results show that adding attention to the network improves performance, leading to efficient loop closures, and outperforming an established 3D LiDAR-based place recognition approach. From the ablation study, results indicate that the middle encoder layers have the highest mean performance, while deeper layers are more robust to orientation change.

| **[GraffMatch: Global Matching of 3D Lines and Planes for Wide Baseline LiDAR Registration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12745v1)** | 2022-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Using geometric landmarks like lines and planes can increase navigation accuracy and decrease map storage requirements compared to commonly-used LiDAR point cloud maps. However, landmark-based registration for applications like loop closure detection is challenging because a reliable initial guess is not available. Global landmark matching has been investigated in the literature, but these methods typically use ad hoc representations of 3D line and plane landmarks that are not invariant to large viewpoint changes, resulting in incorrect matches and high registration error. To address this issue, we adopt the affine Grassmannian manifold to represent 3D lines and planes and prove that the distance between two landmarks is invariant to rotation and translation if a shift operation is performed before applying the Grassmannian metric. This invariance property enables the use of our graph-based data association framework for identifying landmark matches that can subsequently be used for registration in the least-squares sense. Evaluated on a challenging landmark matching and registration task using publicly-available LiDAR datasets, our approach yields a 1.7x and 3.5x improvement in successful registrations compared to methods that use viewpoint-dependent centroid and "closest point" representations, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted to RA-L; 8 pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2205.08556</p></details> |

In this work, we propose a faster, lighter and stronger approach that can generate models with fewer parameters and can spend less time in the inference stage. We designed RepVGG-lite as the backbone network in our architecture, it is more discriminative than other general networks in the Place Recognition task. RepVGG-lite has more speed advantages while achieving higher performance. We extract only one scale patch-level descriptors from global descriptors in the feature extraction stage. Then we design a trainable feature matcher to exploit both spatial relationships of the features and their visual appearance, which is based on the attention mechanism. Comprehensive experiments on challenging benchmark datasets demonstrate the proposed method outperforming recent other state-of-the-art learned approaches, and achieving even higher inference speed. Our system has 14 times less params than Patch-NetVLAD, 6.8 times lower theoretical FLOPs, and run faster 21 and 33 times in feature extraction and feature matching. Moreover, the performance of our approach is 0.5\% better than Patch-NetVLAD in Recall@1.

Our approach decreases the computational overhead of classical approaches by pruning the search space of potential loop closures, prior to evaluation by a typical multi-robot SLAM pipeline. Wi-Closure achieves this by identifying candidates that are spatially close to each other by using sensing over the wireless communication signal between robots, even when they are operating in non-line-of-sight or in remote areas of the environment from one another. We demonstrate the validity of our approach in simulation and hardware experiments. Our results show that using Wi-closure greatly reduces computation time, by 54% in simulation and by 77% in hardware compared, with a multi-robot SLAM baseline. Importantly, this is achieved without sacrificing accuracy. Using Wi-Closure reduces absolute trajectory estimation error by 99% in simulation and 89.2% in hardware experiments. This improvement is due in part to Wi-Closure's ability to avoid catastrophic optimization failure that typically occurs with classical approaches in challenging repetitive environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages without references</p></details> |

This is one of the most critical questions that any intelligent system should answer to decide whether it navigates to a previously visited area. This problem has long been acknowledged for its challenging nature in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), wherein the robot needs to correctly associate the incoming sensory data to the database allowing consistent map generation. The significant advances in computer vision achieved over the last 20 years, the increased computational power, and the growing demand for long-term exploration contributed to efficiently performing such a complex task with inexpensive perception sensors. In this article, visual loop closure detection, which formulates a solution based solely on appearance input data, is surveyed. We start by briefly introducing place recognition and SLAM concepts in robotics. Then, we describe a loop closure detection system's structure, covering an extensive collection of topics, including the feature extraction, the environment representation, the decision-making step, and the evaluation process. We conclude by discussing open and new research challenges, particularly concerning the robustness in dynamic environments, the computational complexity, and scalability in long-term operations. The article aims to serve as a tutorial and a position paper for newcomers to visual loop closure detection.</p></details> | 25 pages, 15 figures |
| **[A Framework for Collaborative Multi-Robot Mapping using Spectral Graph Wavelets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13856v2)** | 2022-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The exploration of large-scale unknown environments can benefit from the deployment of multiple robots for collaborative mapping. Each robot explores a section of the environment and communicates onboard pose estimates and maps to a central server to build an optimized global multi-robot map. Naturally, inconsistencies can arise between onboard and server estimates due to onboard odometry drift, failures, or degeneracies. The mapping server can correct and overcome such failure cases using computationally expensive operations such as inter-robot loop closure detection and multi-modal mapping. However, the individual robots do not benefit from the collaborative map if the mapping server provides no feedback. Although server updates from the multi-robot map can greatly alleviate the robotic mission strategically, most existing work lacks them, due to their associated computational and bandwidth-related costs. Motivated by this challenge, this paper proposes a novel collaborative mapping framework that enables global mapping consistency among robots and the mapping server. In particular, we propose graph spectral analysis, at different spatial scales, to detect structural differences between robot and server graphs, and to generate necessary constraints for the individual robot pose graphs. Our approach specifically finds the nodes that correspond to the drift's origin rather than the nodes where the error becomes too large. We thoroughly analyze and validate our proposed framework using several real-world multi-robot field deployments where we show improvements of the onboard system up to 90\% and can recover the onboard estimation from localization failures and even from the degeneracies within its estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2203.00308</p></details> |
| **[DeepRING: Learning Roto-translation Invariant Representation for LiDAR based Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11029v1)** | 2022-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR based place recognition is popular for loop closure detection and re-localization. In recent years, deep learning brings improvements to place recognition by learnable feature extraction. However, these methods degenerate when the robot re-visits previous places with large perspective difference. To address the challenge, we propose DeepRING to learn the roto-translation invariant representation from LiDAR scan, so that robot visits the same place with different perspective can have similar representations. There are two keys in DeepRING: the feature is extracted from sinogram, and the feature is aggregated by magnitude spectrum. The two steps keeps the final representation with both discrimination and roto-translation invariance. Moreover, we state the place recognition as a one-shot learning problem with each place being a class, leveraging relation learning to build representation similarity. Substantial experiments are carried out on public datasets, validating the effectiveness of each proposed component, and showing that DeepRING outperforms the comparative methods, especially in dataset level generalization.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |

Each sensor is processed by a bio-inspired Spiking Neural Network (SNN) with continual Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) learning, as observed in the brain. In contrast to most learning-based SLAM systems%, which a) require the acquisition of a representative dataset of the environment in which navigation must be performed and b) require an off-line training phase, our method does not require any offline training phase, but rather the SNN continuously learns features from the input data on the fly via STDP. At the same time, the SNN outputs are used as feature descriptors for loop closure detection and map correction. We conduct numerous experiments to benchmark our system against state-of-the-art RGB methods and we demonstrate the robustness of our DVS-Radar SLAM approach under strong lighting variations.</p></details> |  |

Besides, a fast two-stage pose estimation method is proposed to estimate the relative pose after place retrieval by utilizing the compact 2D point clouds extracted from the original data.

| **[Closing the Loop: Graph Networks to Unify Semantic Objects and Visual Features for Multi-object Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11894v1)** | 2022-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), Loop Closure Detection (LCD) is essential to minimize drift when recognizing previously visited places. Visual Bag-of-Words (vBoW) has been an LCD algorithm of choice for many state-of-the-art SLAM systems. It uses a set of visual features to provide robust place recognition but fails to perceive the semantics or spatial relationship between feature points. Previous work has mainly focused on addressing these issues by combining vBoW with semantic and spatial information from objects in the scene. However, they are unable to exploit spatial information of local visual features and lack a structure that unifies semantic objects and visual features, therefore limiting the symbiosis between the two components. This paper proposes SymbioLCD2, which creates a unified graph structure to integrate semantic objects and visual features symbiotically. Our novel graph-based LCD system utilizes the unified graph structure by applying a Weisfeiler-Lehman graph kernel with temporal constraints to robustly predict loop closure candidates. Evaluation of the proposed system shows that having a unified graph structure incorporating semantic objects and visual features improves LCD prediction accuracy, illustrating that the proposed graph structure provides a strong symbiosis between these two complementary components. It also outperforms other Machine Learning algorithms - such as SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Neural Network and GNN based Graph Matching Networks. Furthermore, it has shown good performance in detecting loop closure candidates earlier than state-of-the-art SLAM systems, demonstrating that extended semantic and spatial awareness from the unified graph structure significantly impacts LCD performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages.

Loop closure is a key element of SLAM, with many established methods for this problem. However, current methods are narrow, using either geometric or salient based features. We merge their successes into a model that outperforms both types of methods alone. Our method utilizes inexpensive monocular cameras and does not depend on depth sensors nor Lidar. HGI-SLAM utilizes geometric and salient features, processes them into descriptors, and optimizes them for a bag of words algorithm. By using a concurrent thread and combing our loop closure detection with ORB-SLAM2, our system is a complete SLAM framework. We present extensive evaluations of HGI loop detection and HGI-SLAM on the KITTI and EuRoC datasets. We also provide a qualitative analysis of our features. Our method runs in real time, and is robust to large viewpoint changes while staying accurate in organic environments. HGI-SLAM is an end-to-end SLAM system that only requires monocular vision and is comparable in performance to state-of-the-art SLAM methods.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |

In the case of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) equipped with multibeam echosounders (MBES), data association is particularly challenging due to the scarcity of identifiable landmarks in the seabed, the large drift in dead-reckoning navigation estimates to which AUVs are prone and the low resolution characteristic of MBES data. Deep learning solutions to loop closure detection have shown excellent performance on data from more structured environments. However, their transfer to the seabed domain is not immediate and efforts to port them are hindered by the lack of bathymetric datasets. Thus, in this paper we propose a neural network architecture aimed to showcase the potential of adapting such techniques to correspondence matching in bathymetric data. We train our framework on real bathymetry from an AUV mission and evaluate its performance on the tasks of loop closure detection and coarse point cloud alignment. Finally, we show its potential against a more traditional method and release both its implementation and the dataset used.</p></details> |  |

The place recognition community has made astonishing progress over the last $20$ years, and this has attracted widespread research interest and application in multiple fields such as computer vision and robotics. However, few methods have shown promising place recognition performance in complex real-world scenarios, where long-term and large-scale appearance changes usually result in failures. Additionally, there is a lack of an integrated framework amongst the state-of-the-art methods that can handle all of the challenges in place recognition, which include appearance changes, viewpoint differences, robustness to unknown areas, and efficiency in real-world applications. In this work, we survey the state-of-the-art methods that target long-term localization and discuss future directions and opportunities. We start by investigating the formulation of place recognition in long-term autonomy and the major challenges in real-world environments. We then review the recent works in place recognition for different sensor modalities and current strategies for dealing with various place recognition challenges. Finally, we review the existing datasets for long-term localization and introduce our datasets and evaluation API for different approaches. This paper can be a tutorial for researchers new to the place recognition community and those who care about long-term robotics autonomy. We also provide our opinion on the frequently asked question in robotics: Do robots need accurate localization for long-term autonomy?

With the popularization and application of the technology in wide scope, the practicability of SLAM system has become a new hot topic after the accuracy and robustness, e.g., how to keep the stability of the system and achieve accurate pose estimation in the low-texture and dynamic environment, and how to improve the universality and real-time performance of the system in the real scenes, etc. This paper proposes a real-time stereo indirect visual SLAM system, PLD-SLAM, which combines point and line features, and avoid the impact of dynamic objects in highly dynamic environments. We also present a novel global gray similarity (GGS) algorithm to achieve reasonable keyframe selection and efficient loop closure detection (LCD). Benefiting from the GGS, PLD-SLAM can realize real-time accurate pose estimation in most real scenes without pre-training and loading a huge feature dictionary model. To verify the performance of the proposed system, we compare it with existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on the public datasets KITTI, EuRoC MAV, and the indoor stereo datasets provided by us, etc. The experiments show that the PLD-SLAM has better real-time performance while ensuring stability and accuracy in most scenarios. In addition, through the analysis of the experimental results of the GGS, we can find it has excellent performance in the keyframe selection and LCD.</p></details> |  |

Furthermore an extension to the current state of the art localization SLAM algorithm, ORB-SLAM, is presented. The proposed HGCN-FABMAP method is implemented in an off-line manner incorporating Bayesian probabilistic schema for loop detection decision making. Specifically, we let a Hyperbolic Graph Convolutional Neural Network (HGCN) to operate over the SURF features graph space, and perform vector quantization part of the SLAM procedure. This part previously was performed in an unsupervised manner using algorithms like HKmeans, kmeans++,..etc. The main Advantage of using HGCN, is that it scales linearly in number of graph edges. Experimental results shows that HGCN-FABMAP algorithm needs far more cluster centroids than HGCN-ORB, otherwise it fails to detect loop closures. Therefore we consider HGCN-ORB to be more efficient in terms of memory consumption, also we conclude the superiority of HGCN-BoW and HGCN-FABMAP with respect to other algorithms.</p></details> |  |

We also present AE-ORB-SLAM, a modified version of the current state of the art BoW-based path planning algorithm. That is, we have used a deep convolutional autoencoder to find loop closures. In the context of bag of words visual SLAM, vector quantization (VQ) is considered as the most time-consuming part of the SLAM procedure, which is usually performed in the offline phase of the SLAM algorithm using unsupervised algorithms such as Kmeans++. We have addressed the loop closure detection part of the BoW-based SLAM methods in a self-supervised manner, by integrating an autoencoder for doing vector quantization. This approach can increase the accuracy of large-scale SLAM, where plenty of unlabeled data is available. The main advantage of using a self-supervised is that it can help reducing the amount of labeling. Furthermore, experiments show that autoencoders are far more efficient than semi-supervised methods like graph convolutional neural networks, in terms of speed and memory consumption. We integrated this method into the state of the art long range appearance based visual bag of word SLAM, FABMAP2, also in ORB-SLAM. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of this approach in indoor and outdoor datasets over regular FABMAP2 in all cases, and it achieves higher accuracy in loop closure detection and trajectory generation.</p></details> |  |

This crucial requirement is faced with many challenges in complex and perceptually-degraded subterranean environments, as the onboard perception system is required to operate in off-nominal conditions (poor visibility due to darkness and dust, rugged and muddy terrain, and the presence of self-similar and ambiguous scenes). In a disaster response scenario and in the absence of prior information about the environment, robots must rely on noisy sensor data and perform Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) to build a 3D map of the environment and localize themselves and potential survivors. To that end, this paper reports on a multi-robot SLAM system developed by team CoSTAR in the context of the DARPA Subterranean Challenge. We extend our previous work, LAMP, by incorporating a single-robot front-end interface that is adaptable to different odometry sources and lidar configurations, a scalable multi-robot front-end to support inter- and intra-robot loop closure detection for large scale environments and multi-robot teams, and a robust back-end equipped with an outlier-resilient pose graph optimization based on Graduated Non-Convexity. We provide a detailed ablation study on the multi-robot front-end and back-end, and assess the overall system performance in challenging real-world datasets collected across mines, power plants, and caves in the United States. We also release our multi-robot back-end datasets (and the corresponding ground truth), which can serve as challenging benchmarks for large-scale underground SLAM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hydra: A Real-time Spatial Perception System for 3D Scene Graph Construction and Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.13360v2)** | 2022-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D scene graphs have recently emerged as a powerful high-level representation of 3D environments. A 3D scene graph describes the environment as a layered graph where nodes represent spatial concepts at multiple levels of abstraction and edges represent relations between concepts. While 3D scene graphs can serve as an advanced "mental model" for robots, how to build such a rich representation in real-time is still uncharted territory. This paper describes a real-time Spatial Perception System, a suite of algorithms to build a 3D scene graph from sensor data in real-time. Our first contribution is to develop real-time algorithms to incrementally construct the layers of a scene graph as the robot explores the environment; these algorithms build a local Euclidean Signed Distance Function (ESDF) around the current robot location, extract a topological map of places from the ESDF, and then segment the places into rooms using an approach inspired by community-detection techniques. Our second contribution is to investigate loop closure detection and optimization in 3D scene graphs. We show that 3D scene graphs allow defining hierarchical descriptors for loop closure detection; our descriptors capture statistics across layers in the scene graph, ranging from low-level visual appearance to summary statistics about objects and places. We then propose the first algorithm to optimize a 3D scene graph in response to loop closures; our approach relies on embedded deformation graphs to simultaneously correct all layers of the scene graph. We implement the proposed Spatial Perception System into a architecture named Hydra, that combines fast early and mid-level perception processes with slower high-level perception. We evaluate Hydra on simulated and real data and show it is able to reconstruct 3D scene graphs with an accuracy comparable with batch offline methods despite running online.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 10 figures, published in Robotics Science and Systems (RSS) 2022 proceedings</p></details> |

However, LiDARs do not perform well in geometrically-degraded environments, due to the challenge of loop closure detection and computational load to perform scan matching. Existing WiFi infrastructure can be exploited for localization and mapping with low hardware and computational cost. Yet, accurate pose estimation using WiFi is challenging as different signal values can be measured at the same location due to the unpredictability of signal propagation. Therefore, we introduce the use of WiFi fingerprint sequence for pose estimation (i.e. loop closure) in SLAM. This approach exploits the spatial coherence of location fingerprints obtained while a mobile robot is moving. This has better capability of correcting odometry drift. The method also incorporates LiDAR scans and thus, improving computational efficiency for large and geometrically-degraded environments while maintaining the accuracy of LiDAR SLAM. We conducted experiments in an indoor environment to illustrate the effectiveness of the method. The results are evaluated based on Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and it has achieved an accuracy of 0.88m for the test environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by the 2022 IEEE 18th International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE)</p></details> |

In this paper, aiming at strengthening the relevancy of local neighboring points and the contextual dependency among global points simultaneously, we investigate the exploitation of transformer-based network for feature extraction, and propose a Hierarchical Transformer for Place Recognition (HiTPR). The HiTPR consists of four major parts: point cell generation, short-range transformer (SRT), long-range transformer (LRT) and global descriptor aggregation. Specifically, the point cloud is initially divided into a sequence of small cells by downsampling and nearest neighbors searching. In the SRT, we extract the local feature for each point cell. While in the LRT, we build the global dependency among all of the point cells in the whole point cloud. Experiments on several standard benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of the HiTPR in terms of average recall rate, achieving 93.71% at top 1% and 86.63% at top 1 on the Oxford RobotCar dataset for example.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted paper in ICRA 2022</p></details> |
| **[Bi-directional Loop Closure for Visual SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.01524v1)** | 2022-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A key functional block of visual navigation system for intelligent autonomous vehicles is Loop Closure detection and subsequent relocalisation. State-of-the-Art methods still approach the problem as uni-directional along the direction of the previous motion. As a result, most of the methods fail in the absence of a significantly similar overlap of perspectives. In this study, we propose an approach for bi-directional loop closure. This will, for the first time, provide us with the capability to relocalize to a location even when traveling in the opposite direction, thus significantly reducing long-term odometry drift in the absence of a direct loop. We present a technique to select training data from large datasets in order to make them usable for the bi-directional problem. The data is used to train and validate two different CNN architectures for loop closure detection and subsequent regression of 6-DOF camera pose between the views in an end-to-end manner. The outcome packs a considerable impact and aids significantly to real-world scenarios that do not offer direct loop closure opportunities. We provide a rigorous empirical comparison against other established approaches and evaluate our method on both outdoor and indoor data from the FinnForest dataset and PennCOSYVIO dataset.</p></details> | 11 pages, 11 figures |
| **[AirLoop: Lifelong Loop Closure Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.08975v3)** | 2022-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Loop closure detection is an important building block that ensures the accuracy and robustness of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) systems. Due to their generalization ability, CNN-based approaches have received increasing attention. Although they normally benefit from training on datasets that are diverse and reflective of the environments, new environments often emerge after the model is deployed. It is therefore desirable to incorporate the data newly collected during operation for incremental learning. Nevertheless, simply finetuning the model on new data is infeasible since it may cause the model's performance on previously learned data to degrade over time, which is also known as the problem of catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we present AirLoop, a method that leverages techniques from lifelong learning to minimize forgetting when training loop closure detection models incrementally. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of AirLoop on TartanAir, Nordland, and RobotCar datasets. To the best of our knowledge, AirLoop is one of the first works to achieve lifelong learning of deep loop closure detectors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Modal Lidar Dataset for Benchmarking General-Purpose Localization and Mapping Algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03454v1)** | 2022-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lidar technology has evolved significantly over the last decade, with higher resolution, better accuracy, and lower cost devices available today. In addition, new scanning modalities and novel sensor technologies have emerged in recent years. Public datasets have enabled benchmarking of algorithms and have set standards for the cutting edge technology. However, existing datasets are not representative of the technological landscape, with only a reduced number of lidars available. This inherently limits the development and comparison of general-purpose algorithms in the evolving landscape. This paper presents a novel multi-modal lidar dataset with sensors showcasing different scanning modalities (spinning and solid-state), sensing technologies, and lidar cameras. The focus of the dataset is on low-drift odometry, with ground truth data available in both indoors and outdoors environment with sub-millimeter accuracy from a motion capture (MOCAP) system. For comparison in longer distances, we also include data recorded in larger spaces indoors and outdoors. The dataset contains point cloud data from spinning lidars and solid-state lidars. Also, it provides range images from high resolution spinning lidars, RGB and depth images from a lidar camera, and inertial data from built-in IMUs. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the lidar dataset with the most variety of sensors and environments where ground truth data is available. This dataset can be widely used in multiple research areas, such as 3D LiDAR simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), performance comparison between multi-modal lidars, appearance recognition and loop closure detection. The datasets are available at: https://github.com/TIERS/tiers-lidars-dataset.</p></details> | 8 pages |

L3Ds are emerging compact representations of patches extracted from point clouds that are learnt from data using a deep learning algorithm. We propose a novel overlap measure for loop detection by computing the metric error between points that correspond to mutually-nearest-neighbour descriptors after registering the loop candidate point cloud by its estimated relative pose. This novel approach enables us to accurately detect loops and estimate six degrees-of-freedom poses in the case of small overlaps. We compare our L3D-based loop closure approach with recent approaches on LiDAR data and achieve state-of-the-art loop closure detection accuracy. Additionally, we embed our loop closure approach in RESLAM, a recent edge-based SLAM system, and perform the evaluation on real-world RGBD-TUM and synthetic ICL datasets. Our approach enables RESLAM to achieve a better localisation accuracy compared to its original loop closure strategy.

Over the years, several deep learning approaches have been proposed to address this task, however their performance has been subpar compared to handcrafted techniques, especially while dealing with reverse loops. In this paper, we introduce the novel LCDNet that effectively detects loop closures in LiDAR point clouds by simultaneously identifying previously visited places and estimating the 6-DoF relative transformation between the current scan and the map. LCDNet is composed of a shared encoder, a place recognition head that extracts global descriptors, and a relative pose head that estimates the transformation between two point clouds. We introduce a novel relative pose head based on the unbalanced optimal transport theory that we implement in a differentiable manner to allow for end-to-end training. Extensive evaluations of LCDNet on multiple real-world autonomous driving datasets show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art loop closure detection and point cloud registration techniques by a large margin, especially while dealing with reverse loops. Moreover, we integrate our proposed loop closure detection approach into a LiDAR SLAM library to provide a complete mapping system and demonstrate the generalization ability using different sensor setup in an unseen city.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Robotics (T-RO), 2022</p></details> |
| **[Phase-SLAM: Phase Based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping for Mobile Structured Light Illumination Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09048v1)** | 2022-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Structured Light Illumination (SLI) systems have been used for reliable indoor dense 3D scanning via phase triangulation. However, mobile SLI systems for 360 degree 3D reconstruction demand 3D point cloud registration, involving high computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a phase based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (Phase-SLAM) framework for fast and accurate SLI sensor pose estimation and 3D object reconstruction. The novelty of this work is threefold: (1) developing a reprojection model from 3D points to 2D phase data towards phase registration with low computational complexity; (2) developing a local optimizer to achieve SLI sensor pose estimation (odometry) using the derived Jacobian matrix for the 6 DoF variables; (3) developing a compressive phase comparison method to achieve high-efficiency loop closure detection. The whole Phase-SLAM pipeline is then exploited using existing global pose graph optimization techniques. We build datasets from both the unreal simulation platform and a robotic arm based SLI system in real-world to verify the proposed approach. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed Phase-SLAM outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in terms of the efficiency and accuracy of pose estimation and 3D reconstruction.

However, it is still challenging to achieve high-level performance based on previously trained models in different geographical regions. This paper addresses the problem of their deployment with simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) systems in the new environment. The general baseline approach uses additional information, such as GPS, sequential keyframes tracking, and re-training the whole environment to enhance the recall rate. We propose a novel approach for improving image retrieval based on previously trained models. We present an intelligent method, MAQBOOL, to amplify the power of pre-trained models for better image recall and its application to real-time multiagent SLAM systems. We achieve comparable image retrieval results at a low descriptor dimension (512-D), compared to the high descriptor dimension (4096-D) of state-of-the-art methods. We use spatial information to improve the recall rate in image retrieval on pre-trained models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast and Incremental Loop Closure Detection with Deep Features and Proximity Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11703v2)** | 2022-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the robotics community has extensively examined methods concerning the place recognition task within the scope of simultaneous localization and mapping applications.This article proposes an appearance-based loop closure detection pipeline named ``FILD++" (Fast and Incremental Loop closure Detection).First, the system is fed by consecutive images and, via passing them twice through a single convolutional neural network, global and local deep features are extracted.Subsequently, a hierarchical navigable small-world graph incrementally constructs a visual database representing the robot's traversed path based on the computed global features.Finally, a query image, grabbed each time step, is set to retrieve similar locations on the traversed route.An image-to-image pairing follows, which exploits local features to evaluate the spatial information. Thus, in the proposed article, we propose a single network for global and local feature extraction in contrast to our previous work (FILD), while an exhaustive search for the verification process is adopted over the generated deep local features avoiding the utilization of hash codes. Exhaustive experiments on eleven publicly available datasets exhibit the system's high performance (achieving the highest recall score on eight of them) and low execution times (22.05 ms on average in New College, which is the largest one containing 52480 images) compared to other state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to Journal of Field Robotics</p></details> |
| **[A Universal LiDAR SLAM Accelerator System on Low-cost FPGA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.09523v2)** | 2021-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) serves as a basis for indoor cleaning, navigation, and many other useful applications in both industry and household. From a series of LiDAR scans, it constructs an accurate, globally consistent model of the environment and estimates a robot position inside it. SLAM is inherently computationally intensive; it is a challenging problem to realize a fast and reliable SLAM system on mobile robots with a limited processing capability. To overcome such hurdles, in this paper, we propose a universal, low-power, and resource-efficient accelerator design for 2D LiDAR SLAM targeting resource-limited FPGAs. As scan matching is at the heart of SLAM, the proposed accelerator consists of dedicated scan matching cores on the programmable logic part, and provides software interfaces to facilitate the use. Our accelerator can be integrated to various SLAM methods including the ROS (Robot Operating System)-based ones, and users can switch to a different method without modifying and re-synthesizing the logic part. We integrate the accelerator into three widely-used methods, i.e., scan matching, particle filter, and graph-based SLAM. We evaluate the design in terms of resource utilization, speed, and quality of output results using real-world datasets. Experiment results on a Pynq-Z2 board demonstrate that our design accelerates scan matching and loop-closure detection tasks by up to 14.84x and 18.92x, yielding 4.67x, 4.00x, and 4.06x overall performance improvement in the above methods, respectively. Our design enables the real-time performance while consuming only 2.4W and maintaining accuracy, which is comparable to the software counterparts and even the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

While the problem becomes considerably more challenging when matching should be done jointly across multiple, multimodal sets of data, the robustness and accuracy of matching in the presence of noise and outliers can be greatly improved in this setting. At present, multimodal techniques do not leverage multiway information, and multiway techniques do not incorporate different modalities, leading to inferior results. In contrast, we present a principled mixed-integer quadratic framework to address this issue. We use a novel continuous relaxation in a projected gradient descent algorithm that guarantees feasible solutions of the integer program are obtained efficiently. We demonstrate experimentally that correspondences obtained from our approach are more stable to noise and errors than state-of-the-art techniques. Tested on a robotics dataset, our algorithm resulted in a 35% increase in F1 score when compared to the best alternative.</p></details> | <details><summary>prese...</summary><p>presented in ICRA 2021 Workshop on Robust Perception for Autonomous Field Robots in Challenging Environments</p></details> |

We propose Deep Scan Context (DSC), a general and discriminative global descriptor that captures the relationship among segments of a point cloud. Unlike previous methods that utilize either semantics or a sequence of adjacent point clouds for better place recognition, we only use raw point clouds to get competitive results. Concretely, we first segment the point cloud egocentrically to acquire centroids and eigenvalues of the segments. Then, we introduce a graph neural network to aggregate these features into an embedding representation. Extensive experiments conducted on the KITTI dataset show that DSC is robust to scene variants and outperforms existing methods.</p></details> |  |

In this article, we first present the online construction of a topological map and the implementation of a control law for guiding the robot to the nearest unexplored area, first presented in [1]. The proposed method operates by allowing the robot to localize itself on a partially constructed map, calculate a path to unexplored parts of the environment (frontiers), compute a robust terminating condition when the robot has fully explored the environment, and achieve loop closure detection. The proposed algorithm results in smooth safe paths for the robot's navigation needs. The presented approach is any time algorithm that has the advantage that it allows for the active creation of topological maps from laser scan data, as it is being acquired. We also propose a navigation strategy based on a heuristic where the robot is directed towards nodes in the topological map that open to empty space. We then extend the work in [1] by presenting a topology matching algorithm that leverages the strengths of a particular spectral correspondence method [2], to match the mapped environments generated from our topology-making algorithm. Here, we concentrated on implementing a system that could be used to match the topologies of the mapped environment by using AOF Skeletons. In topology matching between two given maps and their AOF skeletons, we first find correspondences between points on the AOF skeletons of two different environments. We then align the (2D) points of the environments themselves. We also compute a distance measure between two given environments, based on their extracted AOF skeletons and their topology, as the sum of the matching errors between corresponding points.</p></details> |  |

Many state-of-the-art loop closure detection (LCD) algorithms use visual Bag-of-Words (vBoW), which is robust against partial occlusions in a scene but cannot perceive the semantics or spatial relationships between feature points. CNN object extraction can address those issues, by providing semantic labels and spatial relationships between objects in a scene. Previous work has mainly focused on replacing vBoW with CNN-derived features. In this paper, we propose SymbioLCD, a novel ensemble-based LCD that utilizes both CNN-extracted objects and vBoW features for LCD candidate prediction. When used in tandem, the added elements of object semantics and spatial-awareness create a more robust and symbiotic loop closure detection system. The proposed SymbioLCD uses scale-invariant spatial and semantic matching, Hausdorff distance with temporal constraints, and a Random Forest that utilizes combined information from both CNN-extracted objects and vBoW features for predicting accurate loop closure candidates. Evaluation of the proposed method shows it outperforms other Machine Learning (ML) algorithms - such as SVM, Decision Tree and Neural Network, and demonstrates that there is a strong symbiosis between CNN-extracted object information and vBoW features which assists accurate LCD candidate prediction. Furthermore, it is able to perceive loop closure candidates earlier than state-of-the-art SLAM algorithms, utilizing added spatial and semantic information from CNN-extracted objects.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages.

Contrarily to urban or man-made environments, where the presence of unique objects and structures offer unique cues for localization, the appearance of unstructured natural environments is often ambiguous and self-similar, hindering the performances of loop closure detection. In this paper, we present an approach to improve the robustness of place recognition in the context of a submap-based stereo SLAM based on Gaussian Process Gradient Maps (GPGMaps). GPGMaps embed a continuous representation of the gradients of the local terrain elevation by means of Gaussian Process regression and Structured Kernel Interpolation, given solely noisy elevation measurements. We leverage the image-like structure of GPGMaps to detect loop closures using traditional visual features and Bag of Words. GPGMap matching is performed as an SE(2) alignment to establish loop closure constraints within a pose graph. We evaluate the proposed pipeline on a variety of datasets recorded on Mt. Etna, Sicily and in the Morocco desert, respectively Moon- and Mars-like environments, and we compare the localization performances with state-of-the-art approaches for visual SLAM and visual loop closure detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submission to Field Robotics (www.journalfieldrobotics.org), under review</p></details> |

While significant progress has been made through this track, under more challenging configuration for monocular VSLAM, e.g., varying illumination, the performance of state-of-the-art systems generally degrades. As a consequence, robustness and accuracy for monocular VSLAM are still widely concerned. This paper presents a monocular VSLAM system that fully exploits learnt features for better state estimation. The proposed system leverages both learnt local features and global embeddings at different modules of the system: direct camera pose estimation, inter-frame feature association, and loop closure detection. With a probabilistic explanation of keypoint prediction, we formulate the camera pose tracking in a direct manner and parameterize local features with uncertainty taken into account. To alleviate the quantization effect, we adapt the mapping module to generate 3D landmarks better to guarantee the system's robustness. Detecting temporal loop closure via deep global embeddings further improves the robustness and accuracy of the proposed system. The proposed system is extensively evaluated on public datasets (Tsukuba, EuRoC, and KITTI), and compared against the state-of-the-art methods. The competitive performance of camera pose estimation confirms the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Auton...</summary><p>Autonomous Robots; 14 pages, 9 figures; project homepage: https://hyhuang1995.github.io/dgvslam/</p></details> |

As one of the most effective and efficient solutions, Bag-of-Words (BoW) builds a visual vocabulary to associate features and then detect loops. Most existing approaches that build vocabularies off-line determine scales of the vocabulary by trial-and-error, which often results in unreasonable feature association. Moreover, the accuracy of the algorithm usually declines due to perceptual aliasing, as the BoW-based method ignores the positions of visual features. To overcome these disadvantages, we propose a natural convergence criterion based on the comparison between the radii of nodes and the drifts of feature descriptors, which is then utilized to build the optimal vocabulary automatically. Furthermore, we present a novel topological graph verification method for validating candidate loops so that geometrical positions of the words can be involved with a negligible increase in complexity, which can significantly improve the accuracy of LCD.

Recently, probabilistic localization systems utilizing appearance-invariant visual place recognition (VPR) methods as the primary exteroceptive sensor have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in the presence of substantial appearance change. However, existing systems 1) do not fully utilize odometry data within the motion models, and 2) are unable to handle route deviations, due to the assumption that query traverses exactly repeat the mapping traverse. To address these shortcomings, we present a new probabilistic topometric localization system which incorporates full 3-dof odometry into the motion model and furthermore, adds an "off-map" state within the state-estimation framework, allowing query traverses which feature significant route detours from the reference map to be successfully localized. We perform extensive evaluation on multiple query traverses from the Oxford RobotCar dataset exhibiting both significant appearance change and deviations from routes previously traversed. In particular, we evaluate performance on two practically relevant localization tasks: loop closure detection and global localization. Our approach achieves major performance improvements over both existing and improved state-of-the-art systems.</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[A life-long SLAM approach using adaptable local maps based on rasterized LIDAR images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07133v1)** | 2021-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most real-time autonomous robot applications require a robot to traverse through a dynamic space for a long time. In some cases, a robot needs to work in the same environment. Such applications give rise to the problem of a life-long SLAM system. Life-long SLAM presents two main challenges i.e. the tracking should not fail in a dynamic environment and the need for a robust and efficient mapping strategy. The system should update maps with new information; while also keeping track of older observations. But, mapping for a long time can require higher computational requirements. In this paper, we propose a solution to the problem of life-long SLAM. We represent the global map as a set of rasterized images of local maps along with a map management system responsible for updating local maps and keeping track of older values. We also present an efficient approach of using the bag of visual words method for loop closure detection and relocalization. We evaluate the performance of our system on the KITTI dataset and an indoor dataset. Our loop closure system reported recall and precision of above 90 percent. The computational cost of our system is much lower as compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our method reports lower computational requirements even for long-term operation.</p></details> |  |

With the development of 3D semantic segmentation for point cloud, semantic information can be obtained conveniently and steadily, essential for high-level intelligence and conductive to SLAM. In this paper, we present a novel semantic-aided LiDAR SLAM with loop closure based on LOAM, named SA-LOAM, which leverages semantics in odometry as well as loop closure detection. Specifically, we propose a semantic-assisted ICP, including semantically matching, downsampling and plane constraint, and integrates a semantic graph-based place recognition method in our loop closure detection module. Benefitting from semantics, we can improve the localization accuracy, detect loop closures effectively, and construct a global consistent semantic map even in large-scale scenes. Extensive experiments on KITTI and Ford Campus dataset show that our system significantly improves baseline performance, has generalization ability to unseen data and achieves competitive results compared with state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages.

A hybrid point selection strategy is put forward in the tracking front-end, which ensures repeatability of keypoints and enables loop closure detection based on the bag-of-words approach. Every detected loop candidate is verified geometrically and the $Sim(3)$ relative pose constraint is estimated to perform pose graph optimization and global bundle adjustment in the back-end. A comprehensive set of experiments on real-world datasets demonstrates that the hybrid point selection strategy allows reliable loop closure detection, and the accumulated error and scale drift have been significantly reduced via global optimization, enabling PA-SLAM to reach state-of-the-art accuracy while maintaining high robustness and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Applied Optics. 12 pages, 11 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

In this paper, we address the problem of loop closing for SLAM based on 3D laser scans recorded by autonomous cars. Our approach utilizes a deep neural network exploiting different cues generated from LiDAR data for finding loop closures. It estimates an image overlap generalized to range images and provides a relative yaw angle estimate between pairs of scans. Based on such predictions, we tackle loop closure detection and integrate our approach into an existing SLAM system to improve its mapping results. We evaluate our approach on sequences of the KITTI odometry benchmark and the Ford campus dataset. We show that our method can effectively detect loop closures surpassing the detection performance of state-of-the-art methods. To highlight the generalization capabilities of our approach, we evaluate our model on the Ford campus dataset while using only KITTI for training. The experiments show that the learned representation is able to provide reliable loop closure candidates, also in unseen environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by RSS 2020.

| **[Accurate and Robust Scale Recovery for Monocular Visual Odometry Based on Plane Geometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.05995v2)** | 2021-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scale ambiguity is a fundamental problem in monocular visual odometry. Typical solutions include loop closure detection and environment information mining. For applications like self-driving cars, loop closure is not always available, hence mining prior knowledge from the environment becomes a more promising approach. In this paper, with the assumption of a constant height of the camera above the ground, we develop a light-weight scale recovery framework leveraging an accurate and robust estimation of the ground plane. The framework includes a ground point extraction algorithm for selecting high-quality points on the ground plane, and a ground point aggregation algorithm for joining the extracted ground points in a local sliding window. Based on the aggregated data, the scale is finally recovered by solving a least-squares problem using a RANSAC-based optimizer. Sufficient data and robust optimizer enable a highly accurate scale recovery. Experiments on the KITTI dataset show that the proposed framework can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in terms of translation errors, while maintaining competitive performance on the rotation error. Due to the light-weight design, our framework also demonstrates a high frequency of 20Hz on the dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitting to IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation 2021</p></details> |

This paper proposes a novel approach, named NDT-Transformer, for realtime and large-scale place recognition using 3D point clouds. Specifically, a 3D Normal Distribution Transform (NDT) representation is employed to condense the raw, dense 3D point cloud as probabilistic distributions (NDT cells) to provide the geometrical shape description. Then a novel NDT-Transformer network learns a global descriptor from a set of 3D NDT cell representations. Benefiting from the NDT representation and NDT-Transformer network, the learned global descriptors are enriched with both geometrical and contextual information. Finally, descriptor retrieval is achieved using a query-database for place recognition. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, the proposed approach achieves an improvement of 7.52% on average top 1 recall and 2.73% on average top 1% recall on the Oxford Robotcar benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be appear in ICRA2021</p></details> |
| **[Beyond ANN: Exploiting Structural Knowledge for Efficient Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.08366v1)** | 2021-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual place recognition is the task of recognizing same places of query images in a set of database images, despite potential condition changes due to time of day, weather or seasons. It is important for loop closure detection in SLAM and candidate selection for global localization. Many approaches in the literature perform computationally inefficient full image comparisons between queries and all database images. There is still a lack of suited methods for efficient place recognition that allow a fast, sparse comparison of only the most promising image pairs without any loss in performance. While this is partially given by ANN-based methods, they trade speed for precision and additional memory consumption, and many cannot find arbitrary numbers of matching database images in case of loops in the database. In this paper, we propose a novel fast sequence-based method for efficient place recognition that can be applied online. It uses relocalization to recover from sequence losses, and exploits usually available but often unused intra-database similarities for a potential detection of all matching database images for each query in case of loops or stops in the database. We performed extensive experimental evaluations over five datasets and 21 sequence combinations, and show that our method outperforms two state-of-the-art approaches and even full image comparisons in many cases, while providing a good tradeoff between performance and percentage of evaluated image pairs.

Ground-SLAM is developed based on the well-known pose graph optimization framework. In the front-end, motion estimation is conducted using LiDAR Odometry (LO) with a novel sensor-centric sliding map introduced, which is maintained by filtering out expired features based on the model of error propagation. At each key-frame, the sliding map is recorded as a local map. The ground nearby is extracted and modelled as an infinite planar landmark in the form of Closest Point (CP) parameterization. Then, ground planes observed at different key-frames are associated, and the ground constraints are fused into the pose graph optimization framework to compress the pose drift of LO. Finally, loop-closure detection is carried out, and the residual error is jointly minimized, which could lead to a globally consistent map. Experimental results demonstrate superior performances in the accuracy of the proposed approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to conference IROS2021</p></details> |

A key requirement in autonomous exploration is building accurate and consistent maps of the unknown environment that can be used for reliable navigation. Loop closure detection, the ability to assert that a robot has returned to a previously visited location, is crucial for consistent mapping as it reduces the drift caused by error accumulation in the estimated robot trajectory. Moreover, in multi-robot systems, loop closures enable merging local maps obtained by a team of robots into a consistent global map of the environment. In this paper, we present a degeneracy-aware and drift-resilient loop closing method to improve place recognition and resolve 3D location ambiguities for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) in GPS-denied, large-scale and perceptually-degraded environments. More specifically, we focus on SLAM in subterranean environments (e.g., lava tubes, caves, and mines) that represent examples of complex and ambiguous environments where current methods have inadequate performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Journal of Intelligent and Robotic Systems, 2021</p></details> |
| **[Fast Loop Closure Detection via Binary Content](http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.10622v2)** | 2021-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Loop closure detection plays an important role in reducing localization drift in Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM). It aims to find repetitive scenes from historical data to reset localization. To tackle the loop closure problem, existing methods often leverage on the matching of visual features, which achieve good accuracy but require high computational resources. However, feature point based methods ignore the patterns of image, i.e., the shape of the objects as well as the distribution of objects in an image. It is believed that this information is usually unique for a scene and can be utilized to improve the performance of traditional loop closure detection methods. In this paper we leverage and compress the information into a binary image to accelerate an existing fast loop closure detection method via binary content. The proposed method can greatly reduce the computational cost without sacrificing recall rate. It consists of three parts: binary content construction, fast image retrieval and precise loop closure detection. No offline training is required. Our method is compared with the state-of-the-art loop closure detection methods and the results show that it outperforms the traditional methods at both recall rate and speed.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE International Conference on Control and Automation (ICCA) 2019</p></details> |

| **[VIPeR: Visual Incremental Place Recognition with Adaptive Mining and Lifelong Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21416v2)** | 2025-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual place recognition (VPR) is an essential component of many autonomous and augmented/virtual reality systems. It enables the systems to robustly localize themselves in large-scale environments. Existing VPR methods demonstrate attractive performance at the cost of heavy pre-training and limited generalizability. When deployed in unseen environments, these methods exhibit significant performance drops. Targeting this issue, we present VIPeR, a novel approach for visual incremental place recognition with the ability to adapt to new environments while retaining the performance of previous environments. We first introduce an adaptive mining strategy that balances the performance within a single environment and the generalizability across multiple environments. Then, to prevent catastrophic forgetting in lifelong learning, we draw inspiration from human memory systems and design a novel memory bank for our VIPeR. Our memory bank contains a sensory memory, a working memory and a long-term memory, with the first two focusing on the current environment and the last one for all previously visited environments. Additionally, we propose a probabilistic knowledge distillation to explicitly safeguard the previously learned knowledge. We evaluate our proposed VIPeR on three large-scale datasets, namely Oxford Robotcar, Nordland, and TartanAir. For comparison, we first set a baseline performance with naive finetuning. Then, several more recent lifelong learning methods are compared. Our VIPeR achieves better performance in almost all aspects with the biggest improvement of 13.65% in average performance.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

While cost-effective and easily deployed, camera sensors are sensitive to lighting and weather changes, and even slight image alterations can greatly affect VPR efficiency and precision. Existing methods overcome this by exploiting powerful yet large networks, leading to significant consumption of computational resources. In this paper, we propose a high-performance teacher and lightweight student distillation framework called TSCM. It exploits our devised cross-metric knowledge distillation to narrow the performance gap between the teacher and student models, maintaining superior performance while enabling minimal computational load during deployment. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on large-scale datasets, namely Pittsburgh30k and Pittsburgh250k. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method over baseline models in terms of recognition accuracy and model parameter efficiency. Moreover, our ablation studies show that the proposed knowledge distillation technique surpasses other counterparts.

| **[Towards Revisiting Visual Place Recognition for Joining Submaps in Multimap SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12408v2)** | 2025-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual SLAM is a key technology for many autonomous systems. However, tracking loss can lead to the creation of disjoint submaps in multimap SLAM systems like ORB-SLAM3. Because of that, these systems employ submap merging strategies. As we show, these strategies are not always successful. In this paper, we investigate the impact of using modern VPR approaches for submap merging in visual SLAM. We argue that classical evaluation metrics are not sufficient to estimate the impact of a modern VPR component on the overall system. We show that naively replacing the VPR component does not leverage its full potential without requiring substantial interference in the original system. Because of that, we present a post-processing pipeline along with a set of metrics that allow us to estimate the impact of modern VPR components. We evaluate our approach on the NCLT and Newer College datasets using ORB-SLAM3 with NetVLAD and HDC-DELF as VPR components. Additionally, we present a simple approach for combining VPR with temporal consistency for map merging. We show that the map merging performance of ORB-SLAM3 can be improved. Building on these results, researchers in VPR can assess the potential of their approaches for SLAM systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at TAROS 2024.

| **[A Visual-inertial Localization Algorithm using Opportunistic Visual Beacons and Dead-Reckoning for GNSS-Denied Large-scale Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19845v2)** | 2024-12-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the development of smart cities, the demand for continuous pedestrian navigation in large-scale urban environments has significantly increased. While global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) provide low-cost and reliable positioning services, they are often hindered in complex urban canyon environments. Thus, exploring opportunistic signals for positioning in urban areas has become a key solution. Augmented reality (AR) allows pedestrians to acquire real-time visual information. Accordingly, we propose a low-cost visual-inertial positioning solution. This method comprises a lightweight multi-scale group convolution (MSGC)-based visual place recognition (VPR) neural network, a pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) algorithm, and a visual/inertial fusion approach based on a Kalman filter with gross error suppression. The VPR serves as a conditional observation to the Kalman filter, effectively correcting the errors accumulated through the PDR method. This enables the entire algorithm to ensure the reliability of long-term positioning in GNSS-denied areas. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method maintains stable positioning during large-scale movements. Compared to the lightweight MobileNetV3-based VPR method, our proposed VPR solution improves Recall@1 by at least 3\% on two public datasets while reducing the number of parameters by 63.37\%. It also achieves performance that is comparable to the VGG16-based method. The VPR-PDR algorithm improves localization accuracy by more than 40\% compared to the original PDR.</p></details> |  |
| **[MVC-VPR: Mutual Learning of Viewpoint Classification and Visual Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09199v2)** | 2024-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Place Recognition (VPR) aims to robustly identify locations by leveraging image retrieval based on descriptors encoded from environmental images. However, drastic appearance changes of images captured from different viewpoints at the same location pose incoherent supervision signals for descriptor learning, which severely hinder the performance of VPR. Previous work proposes classifying images based on manually defined rules or ground truth labels for viewpoints, followed by descriptor training based on the classification results. However, not all datasets have ground truth labels of viewpoints and manually defined rules may be suboptimal, leading to degraded descriptor performance.To address these challenges, we introduce the mutual learning of viewpoint self-classification and VPR. Starting from coarse classification based on geographical coordinates, we progress to finer classification of viewpoints using simple clustering techniques. The dataset is partitioned in an unsupervised manner while simultaneously training a descriptor extractor for place recognition. Experimental results show that this approach almost perfectly partitions the dataset based on viewpoints, thus achieving mutually reinforcing effects. Our method even excels state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods that partition datasets using ground truth labels.</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[On Motion Blur and Deblurring in Visual Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07751v1)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Place Recognition (VPR) in mobile robotics enables robots to localize themselves by recognizing previously visited locations using visual data. While the reliability of VPR methods has been extensively studied under conditions such as changes in illumination, season, weather and viewpoint, the impact of motion blur is relatively unexplored despite its relevance not only in rapid motion scenarios but also in low-light conditions where longer exposure times are necessary. Similarly, the role of image deblurring in enhancing VPR performance under motion blur has received limited attention so far. This paper bridges these gaps by introducing a new benchmark designed to evaluate VPR performance under the influence of motion blur and image deblurring. The benchmark includes three datasets that encompass a wide range of motion blur intensities, providing a comprehensive platform for analysis. Experimental results with several well-established VPR and image deblurring methods provide new insights into the effects of motion blur and the potential improvements achieved through deblurring. Building on these findings, the paper proposes adaptive deblurring strategies for VPR, designed to effectively manage motion blur in dynamic, real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Hyperdimensional One Place Signature to Represent Them All: Stackable Descriptors For Visual Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06153v1)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Place Recognition (VPR) enables coarse localization by comparing query images to a reference database of geo-tagged images. Recent breakthroughs in deep learning architectures and training regimes have led to methods with improved robustness to factors like environment appearance change, but with the downside that the required training and/or matching compute scales with the number of distinct environmental conditions encountered. Here, we propose Hyperdimensional One Place Signatures (HOPS) to simultaneously improve the performance, compute and scalability of these state-of-the-art approaches by fusing the descriptors from multiple reference sets captured under different conditions. HOPS scales to any number of environmental conditions by leveraging the Hyperdimensional Computing framework. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our approach is highly generalizable and consistently improves recall performance across all evaluated VPR methods and datasets by large margins. Arbitrarily fusing reference images without compute penalty enables numerous other useful possibilities, three of which we demonstrate here: descriptor dimensionality reduction with no performance penalty, stacking synthetic images, and coarse localization to an entire traverse or environmental section.</p></details> | Under Review |

However, existing reviews predominantly concentrate on visual place recognition (VPR) methods. Despite the recent remarkable progress in LPR, to the best of our knowledge, there is no dedicated systematic review in this area. This paper bridges the gap by providing a comprehensive review of place recognition methods employing LiDAR sensors, thus facilitating and encouraging further research. We commence by delving into the problem formulation of place recognition, exploring existing challenges, and describing relations to previous surveys. Subsequently, we conduct an in-depth review of related research, which offers detailed classifications, strengths and weaknesses, and architectures. Finally, we summarize existing datasets, commonly used evaluation metrics, and comprehensive evaluation results from various methods on public datasets.

| **[Distillation of Diffusion Features for Semantic Correspondence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03512v1)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic correspondence, the task of determining relationships between different parts of images, underpins various applications including 3D reconstruction, image-to-image translation, object tracking, and visual place recognition. Recent studies have begun to explore representations learned in large generative image models for semantic correspondence, demonstrating promising results. Building on this progress, current state-of-the-art methods rely on combining multiple large models, resulting in high computational demands and reduced efficiency. In this work, we address this challenge by proposing a more computationally efficient approach. We propose a novel knowledge distillation technique to overcome the problem of reduced efficiency. We show how to use two large vision foundation models and distill the capabilities of these complementary models into one smaller model that maintains high accuracy at reduced computational cost. Furthermore, we demonstrate that by incorporating 3D data, we are able to further improve performance, without the need for human-annotated correspondences. Overall, our empirical results demonstrate that our distilled model with 3D data augmentation achieves performance superior to current state-of-the-art methods while significantly reducing computational load and enhancing practicality for real-world applications, such as semantic video correspondence.

We propose a novel visual place recognition approach based on overlap prediction, called VOP, shifting from traditional reliance on global image similarities and local features to image overlap prediction. VOP proceeds co-visible image sections by obtaining patch-level embeddings using a Vision Transformer backbone and establishing patch-to-patch correspondences without requiring expensive feature detection and matching. Our approach uses a voting mechanism to assess overlap scores for potential database images. It provides a nuanced image retrieval metric in challenging scenarios. Experimental results show that VOP leads to more accurate relative pose estimation and localization results on the retrieved image pairs than state-of-the-art baselines on a number of large-scale, real-world indoor and outdoor benchmarks.

| **[EDTformer: An Efficient Decoder Transformer for Visual Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00784v1)** | 2024-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual place recognition (VPR) aims to determine the general geographical location of a query image by retrieving visually similar images from a large geo-tagged database. To obtain a global representation for each place image, most approaches typically focus on the aggregation of deep features extracted from a backbone through using current prominent architectures (e.g., CNNs, MLPs, pooling layer and transformer encoder), giving little attention to the transformer decoder. However, we argue that its strong capability in capturing contextual dependencies and generating accurate features holds considerable potential for the VPR task. To this end, we propose an Efficient Decoder Transformer (EDTformer) for feature aggregation, which consists of several stacked simplified decoder blocks followed by two linear layers to directly generate robust and discriminative global representations for VPR. Specifically, we do this by formulating deep features as the keys and values, as well as a set of independent learnable parameters as the queries. EDTformer can fully utilize the contextual information within deep features, then gradually decode and aggregate the effective features into the learnable queries to form the final global representations. Moreover, to provide powerful deep features for EDTformer and further facilitate the robustness, we use the foundation model DINOv2 as the backbone and propose a Low-Rank Parallel Adaptation (LoPA) method to enhance it, which can refine the intermediate features of the backbone progressively in a memory- and parameter-efficient way. As a result, our method not only outperforms single-stage VPR methods on multiple benchmark datasets, but also outperforms two-stage VPR methods which add a re-ranking with considerable cost. Code will be available at https://github.com/Tong-Jin01/EDTformer.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures |

Our paper highlights three advancements for SNNs in Visual Place Recognition (VPR). Firstly, we propose Modular SNNs, where each SNN represents a set of non-overlapping geographically distinct places, enabling scalable networks for large environments. Secondly, we present Ensembles of Modular SNNs, where multiple networks represent the same place, significantly enhancing accuracy compared to single-network models. Each of our Modular SNN modules is compact, comprising only 1500 neurons and 474k synapses, making them ideally suited for ensembling due to their small size. Lastly, we investigate the role of sequence matching in SNN-based VPR, a technique where consecutive images are used to refine place recognition.

| **[Multiview Scene Graph](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11187v3)** | 2024-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A proper scene representation is central to the pursuit of spatial intelligence where agents can robustly reconstruct and efficiently understand 3D scenes. A scene representation is either metric, such as landmark maps in 3D reconstruction, 3D bounding boxes in object detection, or voxel grids in occupancy prediction, or topological, such as pose graphs with loop closures in SLAM or visibility graphs in SfM. In this work, we propose to build Multiview Scene Graphs (MSG) from unposed images, representing a scene topologically with interconnected place and object nodes. The task of building MSG is challenging for existing representation learning methods since it needs to jointly address both visual place recognition, object detection, and object association from images with limited fields of view and potentially large viewpoint changes. To evaluate any method tackling this task, we developed an MSG dataset and annotation based on a public 3D dataset. We also propose an evaluation metric based on the intersection-over-union score of MSG edges. Moreover, we develop a novel baseline method built on mainstream pretrained vision models, combining visual place recognition and object association into one Transformer decoder architecture. Experiments demonstrate that our method has superior performance compared to existing relevant baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024.

| **[Self-Supervised Place Recognition by Refining Temporal and Featural Pseudo Labels from Panoramic Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.09315v3)** | 2024-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual place recognition (VPR) using deep networks has achieved state-of-the-art performance. However, most of them require a training set with ground truth sensor poses to obtain positive and negative samples of each observation's spatial neighborhood for supervised learning. When such information is unavailable, temporal neighborhoods from a sequentially collected data stream could be exploited for self-supervised training, although we find its performance suboptimal. Inspired by noisy label learning, we propose a novel self-supervised framework named TF-VPR that uses temporal neighborhoods and learnable feature neighborhoods to discover unknown spatial neighborhoods. Our method follows an iterative training paradigm which alternates between: (1) representation learning with data augmentation, (2) positive set expansion to include the current feature space neighbors, and (3) positive set contraction via geometric verification. We conduct auto-labeling and generalization tests on both simulated and real datasets, with either RGB images or point clouds as inputs. The results show that our method outperforms self-supervised baselines in recall rate, robustness, and heading diversity, a novel metric we propose for VPR. Our code and datasets can be found at https://ai4ce.github.io/TF-VPR/</p></details> |  |

Previously, SVM classifiers have been used to monitor VPR integrity. This research introduces a novel Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) integrity monitor which demonstrates improved performance and generalizability, removing per-environment training and reducing manual tuning requirements. We test our proposed system in extensive real-world experiments, presenting two real-time integrity-based VPR verification methods: a single-query rejection method for robot navigation to a goal zone (Experiment 1); and a history-of-queries method that takes a best, verified, match from its recent trajectory and uses an odometer to extrapolate a current position estimate (Experiment 2). Noteworthy results for Experiment 1 include a decrease in aggregate mean along-track goal error from ~9.8m to ~3.1m, and an increase in the aggregate rate of successful mission completion from ~41% to ~55%. Experiment 2 showed a decrease in aggregate mean along-track localization error from ~2.0m to ~0.5m, and an increase in the aggregate localization precision from ~97% to ~99%. Overall, our results demonstrate the practical usefulness of a VPR integrity monitor in real-world robotics to improve VPR localization and consequent navigation performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Autho...</summary><p>Author Accepted Preprint for Robotics and Automation Letters</p></details> |

In this paper, we introduce a new technique, called Bag-of-Queries (BoQ), which learns a set of global queries designed to capture universal place-specific attributes. Unlike existing methods that employ self-attention and generate the queries directly from the input features, BoQ employs distinct learnable global queries, which probe the input features via cross-attention, ensuring consistent information aggregation. In addition, our technique provides an interpretable attention mechanism and integrates with both CNN and Vision Transformer backbones. The performance of BoQ is demonstrated through extensive experiments on 14 large-scale benchmarks. It consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques including NetVLAD, MixVPR and EigenPlaces. Moreover, as a global retrieval technique (one-stage), BoQ surpasses two-stage retrieval methods, such as Patch-NetVLAD, TransVPR and R2Former, all while being orders of magnitude faster and more efficient.

While Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are the standard default solution for solving the aerial localization problem, it is subject to a number of limitations, such as, signal instability or solution unreliability that make this option not so desirable. Consequently, visual geolocalization is emerging as a viable alternative. However, adapting Visual Place Recognition (VPR) task to aerial imagery presents significant challenges, including weather variations and repetitive patterns. Current VPR reviews largely neglect the specific context of aerial data. This paper introduces a methodology tailored for evaluating VPR techniques specifically in the domain of aerial imagery, providing a comprehensive assessment of various methods and their performance. However, we not only compare various VPR methods, but also demonstrate the importance of selecting appropriate zoom and overlap levels when constructing map tiles to achieve maximum efficiency of VPR algorithms in the case of aerial imagery.

VPR faces challenges such as accurate image neighbor retrieval and appearance change in scenery. Event cameras, also known as dynamic vision sensors, are a new sensor modality for VPR and offer a promising solution to the challenges with their unique attributes: high temporal resolution (1MHz clock), ultra-low latency (in {\mu}s), and high dynamic range (>120dB). These attributes make event cameras less susceptible to motion blur and more robust in variable lighting conditions, making them suitable for addressing VPR challenges. However, the scarcity of event-based VPR datasets, partly due to the novelty and cost of event cameras, hampers their adoption. To fill this data gap, our paper introduces the NYC-Event-VPR dataset to the robotics and computer vision communities, featuring the Prophesee IMX636 HD event sensor (1280x720 resolution), combined with RGB camera and GPS module. It encompasses over 13 hours of geotagged event data, spanning 260 kilometers across New York City, covering diverse lighting and weather conditions, day/night scenarios, and multiple visits to various locations. Furthermore, our paper employs three frameworks to conduct generalization performance assessments, promoting innovation in event-based VPR and its integration into robotics applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distillation Improves Visual Place Recognition for Low Quality Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06906v2)** | 2024-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time visual localization often utilizes online computing, for which query images or videos are transmitted to remote servers for visual place recognition (VPR). However, limited network bandwidth necessitates image-quality reduction and thus the degradation of global image descriptors, reducing VPR accuracy. We address this issue at the descriptor extraction level with a knowledge-distillation methodology that learns feature representations from high-quality images to extract more discriminative descriptors from low-quality images. Our approach includes the Inter-channel Correlation Knowledge Distillation (ICKD) loss, Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss, and Triplet loss. We validate the proposed losses on multiple VPR methods and datasets subjected to JPEG compression, resolution reduction, and video quantization. We obtain significant improvements in VPR recall rates under all three tested modalities of lowered image quality. Furthermore, we fill a gap in VPR literature on video-based data and its influence on VPR performance. This work contributes to more reliable place recognition in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> |  |

Model-free approaches compute the image pair similarity based on a spatial comparison of corresponding local visual features, eliminating the need for computationally expensive estimation of a model describing transformation between images. The article focuses on model-free re-ranking based on standard local visual features and their applicability in long-term autonomy systems. It introduces three new model-free re-ranking methods that were designed primarily for deep-learned local visual features. These features evince high robustness to various appearance changes, which stands as a crucial property for use with long-term autonomy systems. All the introduced methods were employed in a new visual place recognition system together with the D2-net feature detector (Dusmanu, 2019) and experimentally tested with diverse, challenging public datasets. The obtained results are on par with current state-of-the-art methods, affirming that model-free approaches are a viable and worthwhile path for long-term visual place recognition.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 9 figures, IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles (Early Access)</p></details> |
| **[Context-Based Visual-Language Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19341v1)** | 2024-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In vision-based robot localization and SLAM, Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is essential. This paper addresses the problem of VPR, which involves accurately recognizing the location corresponding to a given query image. A popular approach to vision-based place recognition relies on low-level visual features. Despite significant progress in recent years, place recognition based on low-level visual features is challenging when there are changes in scene appearance. To address this, end-to-end training approaches have been proposed to overcome the limitations of hand-crafted features. However, these approaches still fail under drastic changes and require large amounts of labeled data to train models, presenting a significant limitation. Methods that leverage high-level semantic information, such as objects or categories, have been proposed to handle variations in appearance. In this paper, we introduce a novel VPR approach that remains robust to scene changes and does not require additional training. Our method constructs semantic image descriptors by extracting pixel-level embeddings using a zero-shot, language-driven semantic segmentation model. We validate our approach in challenging place recognition scenarios using real-world public dataset. The experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms non-learned image representation techniques and off-the-shelf convolutional neural network (CNN) descriptors.

| **[Pair-VPR: Place-Aware Pre-training and Contrastive Pair Classification for Visual Place Recognition with Vision Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06614v1)** | 2024-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work we propose a novel joint training method for Visual Place Recognition (VPR), which simultaneously learns a global descriptor and a pair classifier for re-ranking. The pair classifier can predict whether a given pair of images are from the same place or not. The network only comprises Vision Transformer components for both the encoder and the pair classifier, and both components are trained using their respective class tokens. In existing VPR methods, typically the network is initialized using pre-trained weights from a generic image dataset such as ImageNet. In this work we propose an alternative pre-training strategy, by using Siamese Masked Image Modelling as a pre-training task. We propose a Place-aware image sampling procedure from a collection of large VPR datasets for pre-training our model, to learn visual features tuned specifically for VPR. By re-using the Mask Image Modelling encoder and decoder weights in the second stage of training, Pair-VPR can achieve state-of-the-art VPR performance across five benchmark datasets with a ViT-B encoder, along with further improvements in localization recall with larger encoders.

To this end, one of the key challenges is cross-modal place recognition, which involves retrieving 3D scenes (point clouds) from a LiDAR map according to online RGB images. In this paper, we introduce an efficient framework to learn descriptors for both RGB images and point clouds. It takes visual state space model (VMamba) as the backbone and employs a pixel-view-scene joint training strategy for cross-modal contrastive learning. To address the field-of-view differences, independent descriptors are generated from multiple evenly distributed viewpoints for point clouds. A visible 3D points overlap strategy is then designed to quantify the similarity between point cloud views and RGB images for multi-view supervision. Additionally, when generating descriptors from pixel-level features using NetVLAD, we compensate for the loss of geometric information, and introduce an efficient scheme for multi-view generation. Experimental results on the KITTI and KITTI-360 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our method. The code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[VLAD-BuFF: Burst-aware Fast Feature Aggregation for Visual Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19293v1)** | 2024-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is a crucial component of many visual localization pipelines for embodied agents. VPR is often formulated as an image retrieval task aimed at jointly learning local features and an aggregation method. The current state-of-the-art VPR methods rely on VLAD aggregation, which can be trained to learn a weighted contribution of features through their soft assignment to cluster centers. However, this process has two key limitations. Firstly, the feature-to-cluster weighting does not account for over-represented repetitive structures within a cluster, e.g., shadows or window panes; this phenomenon is also referred to as the `burstiness' problem, classically solved by discounting repetitive features before aggregation. Secondly, feature to cluster comparisons are compute-intensive for state-of-the-art image encoders with high-dimensional local features. This paper addresses these limitations by introducing VLAD-BuFF with two novel contributions: i) a self-similarity based feature discounting mechanism to learn Burst-aware features within end-to-end VPR training, and ii) Fast Feature aggregation by reducing local feature dimensions specifically through PCA-initialized learnable pre-projection. We benchmark our method on 9 public datasets, where VLAD-BuFF sets a new state of the art. Our method is able to maintain its high recall even for 12x reduced local feature dimensions, thus enabling fast feature aggregation without compromising on recall. Through additional qualitative studies, we show how our proposed weighting method effectively downweights the non-distinctive features.

| **[Revisit Anything: Visual Place Recognition via Image Segment Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18049v1)** | 2024-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately recognizing a revisited place is crucial for embodied agents to localize and navigate. This requires visual representations to be distinct, despite strong variations in camera viewpoint and scene appearance. Existing visual place recognition pipelines encode the "whole" image and search for matches. This poses a fundamental challenge in matching two images of the same place captured from different camera viewpoints: "the similarity of what overlaps can be dominated by the dissimilarity of what does not overlap". We address this by encoding and searching for "image segments" instead of the whole images. We propose to use open-set image segmentation to decompose an image into `meaningful' entities (i.e., things and stuff). This enables us to create a novel image representation as a collection of multiple overlapping subgraphs connecting a segment with its neighboring segments, dubbed SuperSegment. Furthermore, to efficiently encode these SuperSegments into compact vector representations, we propose a novel factorized representation of feature aggregation. We show that retrieving these partial representations leads to significantly higher recognition recall than the typical whole image based retrieval. Our segments-based approach, dubbed SegVLAD, sets a new state-of-the-art in place recognition on a diverse selection of benchmark datasets, while being applicable to both generic and task-specialized image encoders. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of our method to ``revisit anything'' by evaluating our method on an object instance retrieval task, which bridges the two disparate areas of research: visual place recognition and object-goal navigation, through their common aim of recognizing goal objects specific to a place.

While learning-based methods have surpassed traditional handcrafted techniques, their training often relies on simplistic homography-based simulations of multi-view perspectives, limiting model generalisability. This paper presents a novel approach leveraging Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) to generate a diverse and realistic dataset consisting of indoor and outdoor scenes. Our proposed methodology adapts state-of-the-art feature detectors and descriptors for training on multi-view NeRF-synthesised data, with supervision achieved through perspective projective geometry. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed methodology achieves competitive or superior performance on standard benchmarks for relative pose estimation, point cloud registration, and homography estimation while requiring significantly less training data and time compared to existing approaches.</p></details> |  |

We propose a strategy to align the input sensor modalities by leveraging stereo image streams to produce metric depth predictions with pose information, followed by fusing multiple scene views from a local window using a probabilistic occupancy framework to expand the limited field-of-view of the camera. Additionally, SOLVR adopts a flexible definition of what constitutes positive examples for different training losses, allowing us to simultaneously optimise place recognition and registration performance. Furthermore, we replace RANSAC with a registration function that weights a simple least-squares fitting with the estimated inlier likelihood of sparse keypoint correspondences, improving performance in scenarios with a low inlier ratio between the query and retrieved place. Our experiments on the KITTI and KITTI360 datasets show that SOLVR achieves state-of-the-art performance for LiDAR-Visual place recognition and registration, particularly improving registration accuracy over larger distances between the query and retrieved place.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICRA2025</p></details> |
| **[Structured Pruning for Efficient Visual Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07834v1)** | 2024-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is fundamental for the global re-localization of robots and devices, enabling them to recognize previously visited locations based on visual inputs. This capability is crucial for maintaining accurate mapping and localization over large areas. Given that VPR methods need to operate in real-time on embedded systems, it is critical to optimize these systems for minimal resource consumption. While the most efficient VPR approaches employ standard convolutional backbones with fixed descriptor dimensions, these often lead to redundancy in the embedding space as well as in the network architecture. Our work introduces a novel structured pruning method, to not only streamline common VPR architectures but also to strategically remove redundancies within the feature embedding space. This dual focus significantly enhances the efficiency of the system, reducing both map and model memory requirements and decreasing feature extraction and retrieval latencies. Our approach has reduced memory usage and latency by 21% and 16%, respectively, across models, while minimally impacting recall@1 accuracy by less than 1%. This significant improvement enhances real-time applications on edge devices with negligible accuracy loss.</p></details> |  |
| **[Matched Filtering based LiDAR Place Recognition for Urban and Natural Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03998v1)** | 2024-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Place recognition is an important task within autonomous navigation, involving the re-identification of previously visited locations from an initial traverse. Unlike visual place recognition (VPR), LiDAR place recognition (LPR) is tolerant to changes in lighting, seasons, and textures, leading to high performance on benchmark datasets from structured urban environments. However, there is a growing need for methods that can operate in diverse environments with high performance and minimal training. In this paper, we propose a handcrafted matching strategy that performs roto-translation invariant place recognition and relative pose estimation for both urban and unstructured natural environments. Our approach constructs Birds Eye View (BEV) global descriptors and employs a two-stage search using matched filtering -- a signal processing technique for detecting known signals amidst noise. Extensive testing on the NCLT, Oxford Radar, and WildPlaces datasets consistently demonstrates state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance across place recognition and relative pose estimation metrics, with up to 15% higher recall than previous SoTA.</p></details> |  |

Visual place recognition, a critical component for navigation, is often hampered by the high resource demands of conventional systems, making them unsuitable for small-scale robotic platforms which still require to perform complex, long-range tasks. Although neuromorphic approaches offer potential for greater efficiency, real-time edge deployment remains constrained by the complexity and limited scalability of bio-realistic networks.

Nevertheless, their downstream task performance is greatly influenced by the optimization of bias parameters. These parameters, for instance, regulate the necessary change in light intensity to trigger an event, which in turn depends on factors such as the environment lighting and camera motion. This paper introduces feedback control algorithms that automatically tune the bias parameters through two interacting methods: 1) An immediate, on-the-fly \textit{fast} adaptation of the refractory period, which sets the minimum interval between consecutive events, and 2) if the event rate exceeds the specified bounds even after changing the refractory period repeatedly, the controller adapts the pixel bandwidth and event thresholds, which stabilizes after a short period of noise events across all pixels (\textit{slow} adaptation). Our evaluation focuses on the visual place recognition task, where incoming query images are compared to a given reference database. We conducted comprehensive evaluations of our algorithms' adaptive feedback control in real-time. To do so, we collected the QCR-Fast-and-Slow dataset that contains DAVIS346 event camera streams from 366 repeated traversals of a Scout Mini robot navigating through a 100 meter long indoor lab setting (totaling over 35km distance traveled) in varying brightness conditions with ground truth location information. Our proposed feedback controllers result in superior performance when compared to the standard bias settings and prior feedback control methods. Our findings also detail the impact of bias adjustments on task performance and feature ablation studies on the fast and slow adaptation mechanisms.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 9 figures, paper accepted to the 2024 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2024)</p></details> |

While existing work demonstrates the viability of meshes for visual localization, the impact of using synthetic databases rendered from them in visual place recognition remains largely unexplored. In this work we investigate using dense 3D textured meshes for large-scale Visual Place Recognition (VPR). We identify a significant performance drop when using synthetic mesh-based image databases compared to real-world images for retrieval. To address this, we propose MeshVPR, a novel VPR pipeline that utilizes a lightweight features alignment framework to bridge the gap between real-world and synthetic domains. MeshVPR leverages pre-trained VPR models and is efficient and scalable for city-wide deployments. We introduce novel datasets with freely available 3D meshes and manually collected queries from Berlin, Paris, and Melbourne.

The motivation arises from two key observations about place recognition methods based on both appearance and structure: 1) For the methods relying on LiDAR sensors, the integration of LiDAR in robotic systems has led to increased expenses, while the alignment of data between different sensors is also a major challenge. 2) Other image-/camera-based methods, involving integrating RGB images and their derived variants (eg, pseudo depth images, pseudo 3D point clouds), exhibit several limitations, such as the failure to effectively exploit the explicit spatial relationships between different objects. To tackle the above issues, we design a new BEV-enhanced VPR framework, namely BEV$^2$PR, generating a composite descriptor with both visual cues and spatial awareness based on a single camera. The key points lie in: 1) We use BEV features as an explicit source of structural knowledge in constructing global features. 2) The lower layers of the pre-trained backbone from BEV generation are shared for visual and structural streams in VPR, facilitating the learning of fine-grained local features in the visual stream. 3) The complementary visual and structural features can jointly enhance VPR performance. Our BEV$^2$PR framework enables consistent performance improvements over several popular aggregation modules for RGB global features. The experiments on our collected VPR-NuScenes dataset demonstrate an absolute gain of 2.47% on Recall@1 for the strong Conv-AP baseline to achieve the best performance in our setting, and notably, a 18.06% gain on the hard set.

Our experiments in CARLA environment in accordance with the Leaderboard benchmark reveal that the proposed pre-training is more efficient than classification-based pre-training, and is on par with the recently proposed pre-training based on visual place recognition (VPRPre).</p></details> |  |
| **[LVLM-empowered Multi-modal Representation Learning for Visual Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06730v1)** | 2024-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual place recognition (VPR) remains challenging due to significant viewpoint changes and appearance variations. Mainstream works tackle these challenges by developing various feature aggregation methods to transform deep features into robust and compact global representations. Unfortunately, satisfactory results cannot be achieved under challenging conditions. We start from a new perspective and attempt to build a discriminative global representations by fusing image data and text descriptions of the the visual scene. The motivation is twofold: (1) Current Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate extraordinary emergent capability in visual instruction following, and thus provide an efficient and flexible manner in generating text descriptions of images; (2) The text descriptions, which provide high-level scene understanding, show strong robustness against environment variations. Although promising, leveraging LVLMs to build multi-modal VPR solutions remains challenging in efficient multi-modal fusion. Furthermore, LVLMs will inevitably produces some inaccurate descriptions, making it even harder. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel multi-modal VPR solution. It first adapts pre-trained visual and language foundation models to VPR for extracting image and text features, which are then fed into the feature combiner to enhance each other. As the main component, the feature combiner first propose a token-wise attention block to adaptively recalibrate text tokens according to their relevance to the image data, and then develop an efficient cross-attention fusion module to propagate information across different modalities. The enhanced multi-modal features are compressed into the feature descriptor for performing retrieval. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin with significantly smaller image descriptor dimension.</p></details> |  |
| **[Close, But Not There: Boosting Geographic Distance Sensitivity in Visual Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02422v1)** | 2024-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Place Recognition (VPR) plays a critical role in many localization and mapping pipelines. It consists of retrieving the closest sample to a query image, in a certain embedding space, from a database of geotagged references. The image embedding is learned to effectively describe a place despite variations in visual appearance, viewpoint, and geometric changes. In this work, we formulate how limitations in the Geographic Distance Sensitivity of current VPR embeddings result in a high probability of incorrectly sorting the top-k retrievals, negatively impacting the recall. In order to address this issue in single-stage VPR, we propose a novel mining strategy, CliqueMining, that selects positive and negative examples by sampling cliques from a graph of visually similar images. Our approach boosts the sensitivity of VPR embeddings at small distance ranges, significantly improving the state of the art on relevant benchmarks. In particular, we raise recall@1 from 75% to 82% in MSLS Challenge, and from 76% to 90% in Nordland. Models and code are available at https://github.com/serizba/cliquemining.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamically Modulating Visual Place Recognition Sequence Length For Minimum Acceptable Performance Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00863v1)** | 2024-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mobile robots and autonomous vehicles are often required to function in environments where critical position estimates from sensors such as GPS become uncertain or unreliable. Single image visual place recognition (VPR) provides an alternative for localization but often requires techniques such as sequence matching to improve robustness, which incurs additional computation and latency costs. Even then, the sequence length required to localize at an acceptable performance level varies widely; and simply setting overly long fixed sequence lengths creates unnecessary latency, computational overhead, and can even degrade performance. In these scenarios it is often more desirable to meet or exceed a set target performance at minimal expense. In this paper we present an approach which uses a calibration set of data to fit a model that modulates sequence length for VPR as needed to exceed a target localization performance. We make use of a coarse position prior, which could be provided by any other localization system, and capture the variation in appearance across this region. We use the correlation between appearance variation and sequence length to curate VPR features and fit a multilayer perceptron (MLP) for selecting the optimal length. We demonstrate that this method is effective at modulating sequence length to maximize the number of sections in a dataset which meet or exceed a target performance whilst minimizing the median length used. We show applicability across several datasets and reveal key phenomena like generalization capabilities, the benefits of curating features and the utility of non-state-of-the-art feature extractors with nuanced properties.</p></details> | DOI TBC |

State-of-the-art pipelines focus on the aggregation of features extracted from a deep backbone, in order to form a global descriptor for each image. In this context, we introduce SALAD (Sinkhorn Algorithm for Locally Aggregated Descriptors), which reformulates NetVLAD's soft-assignment of local features to clusters as an optimal transport problem. In SALAD, we consider both feature-to-cluster and cluster-to-feature relations and we also introduce a 'dustbin' cluster, designed to selectively discard features deemed non-informative, enhancing the overall descriptor quality. Additionally, we leverage and fine-tune DINOv2 as a backbone, which provides enhanced description power for the local features, and dramatically reduces the required training time. As a result, our single-stage method not only surpasses single-stage baselines in public VPR datasets, but also surpasses two-stage methods that add a re-ranking with significantly higher cost. Code and models are available at https://github.com/serizba/salad.</p></details> |  |

However, their performance in place recognition is still underexplored. In this work, we introduce multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) to visual place recognition (VPR), where a robot must localize itself using visual observations. Our key design is to use vision-based retrieval to propose several candidates and then leverage language-based reasoning to carefully inspect each candidate for a final decision. Specifically, we leverage the robust visual features produced by off-the-shelf vision foundation models (VFMs) to obtain several candidate locations. We then prompt an MLLM to describe the differences between the current observation and each candidate in a pairwise manner, and reason about the best candidate based on these descriptions. Our results on three datasets demonstrate that integrating the general-purpose visual features from VFMs with the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs already provides an effective place recognition solution, without any VPR-specific supervised training. We believe our work can inspire new possibilities for applying and designing foundation models, i.e., VFMs, LLMs, and MLLMs, to enhance the localization and navigation of mobile robots.</p></details> |  |

| **[EffoVPR: Effective Foundation Model Utilization for Visual Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18065v1)** | 2024-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The task of Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is to predict the location of a query image from a database of geo-tagged images. Recent studies in VPR have highlighted the significant advantage of employing pre-trained foundation models like DINOv2 for the VPR task. However, these models are often deemed inadequate for VPR without further fine-tuning on task-specific data. In this paper, we propose a simple yet powerful approach to better exploit the potential of a foundation model for VPR. We first demonstrate that features extracted from self-attention layers can serve as a powerful re-ranker for VPR. Utilizing these features in a zero-shot manner, our method surpasses previous zero-shot methods and achieves competitive results compared to supervised methods across multiple datasets. Subsequently, we demonstrate that a single-stage method leveraging internal ViT layers for pooling can generate global features that achieve state-of-the-art results, even when reduced to a dimensionality as low as 128D. Nevertheless, incorporating our local foundation features for re-ranking, expands this gap. Our approach further demonstrates remarkable robustness and generalization, achieving state-of-the-art results, with a significant gap, in challenging scenarios, involving occlusion, day-night variations, and seasonal changes.</p></details> |  |

Contemporary methods in visual place recognition employ convolutional neural networks and utilize every region within the image for the place recognition task. However, the presence of dynamic and distracting elements in the image may impact the effectiveness of the place recognition process. Therefore, it is meaningful to focus on task-relevant regions of the image for improved recognition. In this paper, we present PlaceFormer, a novel transformer-based approach for visual place recognition. PlaceFormer employs patch tokens from the transformer to create global image descriptors, which are then used for image retrieval. To re-rank the retrieved images, PlaceFormer merges the patch tokens from the transformer to form multi-scale patches. Utilizing the transformer's self-attention mechanism, it selects patches that correspond to task-relevant areas in an image. These selected patches undergo geometric verification, generating similarity scores across different patch sizes. Subsequently, spatial scores from each patch size are fused to produce a final similarity score. This score is then used to re-rank the images initially retrieved using global image descriptors. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that PlaceFormer outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency, requiring less time and memory.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Robotics and Automation Letters</p></details> |

Due to the significant changes in appearance caused by season, lighting, and time spans between query images and database images for retrieval, these differences increase the difficulty of place recognition. Previous methods often discarded useless features (such as sky, road, vehicles) while uncontrolled discarding features that help improve recognition accuracy (such as buildings, trees). To preserve these useful features, we propose a new feature aggregation method to address this issue. Specifically, in order to obtain global and local features that contain discriminative place information, we added some registers on top of the original image tokens to assist in model training. After reallocating attention weights, these registers were discarded. The experimental results show that these registers surprisingly separate unstable features from the original image representation and outperform state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

VPR uses a database of geo-tagged images and leverages deep neural networks to extract a global representation, called descriptor, from each image. While the training data for VPR models often originates from diverse, geographically scattered sources (geo-tagged images), the training process itself is typically assumed to be centralized. This research revisits the task of VPR through the lens of Federated Learning (FL), addressing several key challenges associated with this adaptation. VPR data inherently lacks well-defined classes, and models are typically trained using contrastive learning, which necessitates a data mining step on a centralized database. Additionally, client devices in federated systems can be highly heterogeneous in terms of their processing capabilities. The proposed FedVPR framework not only presents a novel approach for VPR but also introduces a new, challenging, and realistic task for FL research, paving the way to other image retrieval tasks in FL.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 7 figures, CVPR - The 3rd International Workshop on Federated Learning for Computer Vision (FedVision-2024)</p></details> |

However, the analogous robotics capability, visual place recognition (VPR) with limited field of view cameras under 180 degree rotations, has proven to be challenging to achieve. To address this problem, this paper presents Same Place Opposing Trajectory (SPOT), a technique for opposing viewpoint VPR that relies exclusively on structure estimated through stereo visual odometry (VO). The method extends recent advances in lidar descriptors and utilizes a novel double (similar and opposing) distance matrix sequence matching method. We evaluate SPOT on a publicly available dataset with 6.7-7.6 km routes driven in similar and opposing directions under various lighting conditions. The proposed algorithm demonstrates remarkable improvement over the state-of-the-art, achieving up to 91.7% recall at 100% precision in opposing viewpoint cases, while requiring less storage than all baselines tested and running faster than all but one. Moreover, the proposed method assumes no a priori knowledge of whether the viewpoint is similar or opposing, and also demonstrates competitive performance in similar viewpoint cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICRA 2024, project website: https://umautobots.github.io/spot</p></details> |

Thanks to the practical feature extraction ability of the lightweight convolution neural networks (CNNs) and the train-ability of the vector of locally aggregated descriptors (VLAD) layer, we propose a lightweight weakly supervised end-to-end neural network consisting of a front-ended perception model called GhostCNN and a learnable VLAD layer as a back-end. GhostCNN is based on Ghost modules that are lightweight CNN-based architectures. They can generate redundant feature maps using linear operations instead of the traditional convolution process, making a good trade-off between computation resources and recognition accuracy. To enhance our proposed lightweight model further, we add dilated convolutions to the Ghost module to get features containing more spatial semantic information, improving accuracy. Finally, rich experiments conducted on a commonly used public benchmark and our private dataset validate that the proposed neural network reduces the FLOPs and parameters of VGG16-NetVLAD by 99.04% and 80.16%, respectively. Besides, both models achieve similar accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Seamless Adaptation of Pre-trained Models for Visual Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14505v3)** | 2024-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies show that vision models pre-trained in generic visual learning tasks with large-scale data can provide useful feature representations for a wide range of visual perception problems. However, few attempts have been made to exploit pre-trained foundation models in visual place recognition (VPR). Due to the inherent difference in training objectives and data between the tasks of model pre-training and VPR, how to bridge the gap and fully unleash the capability of pre-trained models for VPR is still a key issue to address. To this end, we propose a novel method to realize seamless adaptation of pre-trained models for VPR. Specifically, to obtain both global and local features that focus on salient landmarks for discriminating places, we design a hybrid adaptation method to achieve both global and local adaptation efficiently, in which only lightweight adapters are tuned without adjusting the pre-trained model. Besides, to guide effective adaptation, we propose a mutual nearest neighbor local feature loss, which ensures proper dense local features are produced for local matching and avoids time-consuming spatial verification in re-ranking. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with less training data and training time, and uses about only 3% retrieval runtime of the two-stage VPR methods with RANSAC-based spatial verification. It ranks 1st on the MSLS challenge leaderboard (at the time of submission). The code is released at https://github.com/Lu-Feng/SelaVPR.</p></details> | ICLR2024 |

These networks typically produce a global representation of a place image using only this image itself and neglect the cross-image variations (e.g. viewpoint and illumination), which limits their robustness in challenging scenes. In this paper, we propose a robust global representation method with cross-image correlation awareness for VPR, named CricaVPR. Our method uses the attention mechanism to correlate multiple images within a batch. These images can be taken in the same place with different conditions or viewpoints, or even captured from different places. Therefore, our method can utilize the cross-image variations as a cue to guide the representation learning, which ensures more robust features are produced. To further facilitate the robustness, we propose a multi-scale convolution-enhanced adaptation method to adapt pre-trained visual foundation models to the VPR task, which introduces the multi-scale local information to further enhance the cross-image correlation-aware representation. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin with significantly less training time.

As is typical for image retrieval problems, a feature extractor maps the query and reference images to a feature space, where a nearest neighbor search is then performed. However, till recently little attention has been given to quantifying the confidence that a retrieved reference image is a correct match. Highly certain but incorrect retrieval can lead to catastrophic failure of VPR-based localization pipelines. This work compares for the first time the main approaches for estimating the image-matching uncertainty, including the traditional retrieval-based uncertainty estimation, more recent data-driven aleatoric uncertainty estimation, and the compute-intensive geometric verification. We further formulate a simple baseline method, ``SUE'', which unlike the other methods considers the freely-available poses of the reference images in the map. Our experiments reveal that a simple L2-distance between the query and reference descriptors is already a better estimate of image-matching uncertainty than current data-driven approaches. SUE outperforms the other efficient uncertainty estimation methods, and its uncertainty estimates complement the computationally expensive geometric verification approach. Future works for uncertainty estimation in VPR should consider the baselines discussed in this work.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in the proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) 2024</p></details> |

Each scene has multiple revisits across a year. To establish the ground truth for VPR, we propose a semiautomatic annotation approach that computes the positional information of each image. Our method specifically takes pairs of videos as input and yields matched pairs of images along with their estimated relative locations. The accuracy of this matching is refined by human annotators, who utilize our annotation software to correlate the selected keyframes.

Since typically a mobile robot has access to a continuous stream of frames, this task is naturally cast as a sequence-to-sequence localization problem. Nevertheless, obtaining sequences of labelled data is much more expensive than collecting isolated images, which can be done in an automated way with little supervision. As a mitigation to this problem, we propose a novel Joint Image and Sequence Training protocol (JIST) that leverages large uncurated sets of images through a multi-task learning framework. With JIST we also introduce SeqGeM, an aggregation layer that revisits the popular GeM pooling to produce a single robust and compact embedding from a sequence of single-frame embeddings. We show that our model is able to outperform previous state of the art while being faster, using 8 times smaller descriptors, having a lighter architecture and allowing to process sequences of various lengths.

However, like many vision tasks, VPR always degrades at night due to the scarcity of nighttime images. Moreover, VPR needs to address the cross-domain problem of night-to-day rather than just the issue of a single nighttime domain. In response to these issues, we present NocPlace, which leverages generative and inherited knowledge transfer to embed resilience against dazzling lights and extreme darkness in the global descriptor. First, we establish a day-night urban scene dataset called NightCities, capturing diverse lighting variations and dark scenarios across 60 cities globally. Then, an image generation network is trained on this dataset and processes a large-scale VPR dataset, obtaining its nighttime version. Finally, VPR models are fine-tuned using descriptors inherited from themselves and night-style images, which builds explicit cross-domain contrastive relationships. Comprehensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate our contributions and the superiority of NocPlace. Without adding any real-time computing resources, NocPlace improves the performance of Eigenplaces by 7.6% on Tokyo 24/7 Night and 16.8% on SVOX Night.</p></details> | 28 pages,9 figures |

Recently, the hierarchical VPR methods have received considerable attention due to the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. They usually first use global features to retrieve the candidate images, then verify the spatial consistency of matched local features for re-ranking. However, the latter typically relies on the RANSAC algorithm for fitting homography, which is time-consuming and non-differentiable. This makes existing methods compromise to train the network only in global feature extraction. Here, we propose a transformer-based deep homography estimation (DHE) network that takes the dense feature map extracted by a backbone network as input and fits homography for fast and learnable geometric verification. Moreover, we design a re-projection error of inliers loss to train the DHE network without additional homography labels, which can also be jointly trained with the backbone network to help it extract the features that are more suitable for local matching. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method can outperform several state-of-the-art methods. And it is more than one order of magnitude faster than the mainstream hierarchical VPR methods using RANSAC.

Further, a well-balanced combination of data-based and training-free approaches can decrease the required amount of training data and effort and can reduce the influence of distribution shifts between the training and application phases. This paper proposes a runtime and data-efficient hierarchical VPR pipeline that extends existing approaches and presents novel ideas. There are three main contributions: First, we propose Local Positional Graphs (LPG), a training-free and runtime-efficient approach to encode spatial context information of local image features. LPG can be combined with existing local feature detectors and descriptors and considerably improves the image-matching quality compared to existing techniques in our experiments. Second, we present Attentive Local SPED (ATLAS), an extension of our previous local features approach with an attention module that improves the feature quality while maintaining high data efficiency. The influence of the proposed modifications is evaluated in an extensive ablation study. Third, we present a hierarchical pipeline that exploits hyperdimensional computing to use the same local features as holistic HDC-descriptors for fast candidate selection and for candidate reranking. We combine all contributions in a runtime and data-efficient VPR pipeline that shows benefits over the state-of-the-art method Patch-NetVLAD on a large collection of standard place recognition datasets with 15$\%$ better performance in VPR accuracy, 54$\times$ faster feature comparison speed, and 55$\times$ less descriptor storage occupancy, making our method promising for real-world high-performance large-scale VPR in changing environments.

Two parallel lines of work on VPR have shown, on one side, that general-purpose off-the-shelf feature representations can provide robustness to domain shifts, and, on the other, that fused information from sequences of images improves performance. In our recent work on measuring domain gaps between image datasets, we proposed a Visual Distribution of Neuron Activations (VDNA) representation to represent datasets of images. This representation can naturally handle image sequences and provides a general and granular feature representation derived from a general-purpose model. Moreover, our representation is based on tracking neuron activation values over the list of images to represent and is not limited to a particular neural network layer, therefore having access to high- and low-level concepts. This work shows how VDNAs can be used for VPR by learning a very lightweight and simple encoder to generate task-specific descriptors. Our experiments show that our representation can allow for better robustness than current solutions to serious domain shifts away from the training data distribution, such as to indoor environments and aerial imagery.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICRA 2024</p></details> |

Ideas like multi-process fusion, Fly-Inspired Voting Units, SwitchHit or Switch-Fuse involve combining different VPR techniques together, utilizing different strategies. However, a major aspect often common to many of these strategies is voting. Voting is an extremely relevant topic to explore in terms of its application and significance for any ensemble VPR setup. This paper analyses several voting schemes to maximise the place detection accuracy of a VPR ensemble set up and determine the optimal voting schemes for selection. We take inspiration from a variety of voting schemes that are widely employed in fields such as politics and sociology and it is evident via empirical data that the selection of the voting method influences the results drastically. The paper tests a wide variety of voting schemes to present the improvement in the VPR results for several data sets. We aim to determine whether a single optimal voting scheme exists or, much like in other fields of research, the selection of a voting technique is relative to its application and environment. We propose a ranking of these different voting methods from best to worst which allows for better selection. While presenting our results in terms of voting method's performance bounds, in form of radar charts, PR curves to showcase the difference in performance and a comparison methodology using a McNemar test variant to determine the statistical significance of the differences.

While these capabilities are well suited for robotics tasks, SNNs have seen limited adaptation in this field thus far. This work introduces a SNN for Visual Place Recognition (VPR) that is both trainable within minutes and queryable in milliseconds, making it well suited for deployment on compute-constrained robotic systems. Our proposed system, VPRTempo, overcomes slow training and inference times using an abstracted SNN that trades biological realism for efficiency. VPRTempo employs a temporal code that determines the timing of a single spike based on a pixel's intensity, as opposed to prior SNNs relying on rate coding that determined the number of spikes; improving spike efficiency by over 100%. VPRTempo is trained using Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity and a supervised delta learning rule enforcing that each output spiking neuron responds to just a single place. We evaluate our system on the Nordland and Oxford RobotCar benchmark localization datasets, which include up to 27k places. We found that VPRTempo's accuracy is comparable to prior SNNs and the popular NetVLAD place recognition algorithm, while being several orders of magnitude faster and suitable for real-time deployment -- with inference speeds over 50 Hz on CPU. VPRTempo could be integrated as a loop closure component for online SLAM on resource-constrained systems such as space and underwater robots.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, accepted to the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) 2024</p></details> |
| **[PlaceNav: Topological Navigation through Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17260v4)** | 2024-02-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent results suggest that splitting topological navigation into robot-independent and robot-specific components improves navigation performance by enabling the robot-independent part to be trained with data collected by robots of different types. However, the navigation methods' performance is still limited by the scarcity of suitable training data and they suffer from poor computational scaling. In this work, we present PlaceNav, subdividing the robot-independent part into navigation-specific and generic computer vision components. We utilize visual place recognition for the subgoal selection of the topological navigation pipeline. This makes subgoal selection more efficient and enables leveraging large-scale datasets from non-robotics sources, increasing training data availability. Bayesian filtering, enabled by place recognition, further improves navigation performance by increasing the temporal consistency of subgoals. Our experimental results verify the design and the new method obtains a 76% higher success rate in indoor and 23% higher in outdoor navigation tasks with higher computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICRA2...</summary><p>ICRA2024 camera ready</p></details> |
| **[VOLoc: Visual Place Recognition by Querying Compressed Lidar Map](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15961v1)** | 2024-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The availability of city-scale Lidar maps enables the potential of city-scale place recognition using mobile cameras. However, the city-scale Lidar maps generally need to be compressed for storage efficiency, which increases the difficulty of direct visual place recognition in compressed Lidar maps. This paper proposes VOLoc, an accurate and efficient visual place recognition method that exploits geometric similarity to directly query the compressed Lidar map via the real-time captured image sequence. In the offline phase, VOLoc compresses the Lidar maps using a \emph{Geometry-Preserving Compressor} (GPC), in which the compression is reversible, a crucial requirement for the downstream 6DoF pose estimation. In the online phase, VOLoc proposes an online Geometric Recovery Module (GRM), which is composed of online Visual Odometry (VO) and a point cloud optimization module, such that the local scene structure around the camera is online recovered to build the \emph{Querying Point Cloud} (QPC). Then the QPC is compressed by the same GPC, and is aggregated into a global descriptor by an attention-based aggregation module, to query the compressed Lidar map in the vector space. A transfer learning mechanism is also proposed to improve the accuracy and the generality of the aggregation network. Extensive evaluations show that VOLoc provides localization accuracy even better than the Lidar-to-Lidar place recognition, setting up a new record for utilizing the compressed Lidar map by low-end mobile cameras. The code are publicly available at https://github.com/Master-cai/VOLoc.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7figures, ICRA 2024</p></details> |
| **[Spike-EVPR: Deep Spiking Residual Network with Cross-Representation Aggregation for Event-Based Visual Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10476v1)** | 2024-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event cameras have been successfully applied to visual place recognition (VPR) tasks by using deep artificial neural networks (ANNs) in recent years. However, previously proposed deep ANN architectures are often unable to harness the abundant temporal information presented in event streams. In contrast, deep spiking networks exhibit more intricate spatiotemporal dynamics and are inherently well-suited to process sparse asynchronous event streams. Unfortunately, directly inputting temporal-dense event volumes into the spiking network introduces excessive time steps, resulting in prohibitively high training costs for large-scale VPR tasks. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a novel deep spiking network architecture called Spike-EVPR for event-based VPR tasks. First, we introduce two novel event representations tailored for SNN to fully exploit the spatio-temporal information from the event streams, and reduce the video memory occupation during training as much as possible. Then, to exploit the full potential of these two representations, we construct a Bifurcated Spike Residual Encoder (BSR-Encoder) with powerful representational capabilities to better extract the high-level features from the two event representations. Next, we introduce a Shared & Specific Descriptor Extractor (SSD-Extractor). This module is designed to extract features shared between the two representations and features specific to each. Finally, we propose a Cross-Descriptor Aggregation Module (CDA-Module) that fuses the above three features to generate a refined, robust global descriptor of the scene. Our experimental results indicate the superior performance of our Spike-EVPR compared to several existing EVPR pipelines on Brisbane-Event-VPR and DDD20 datasets, with the average Recall@1 increased by 7.61% on Brisbane and 13.20% on DDD20.</p></details> | 14 pages, 10 figures |

Existing methods often rely on contrastive learning: image descriptors are trained to have small distance for similar images and larger distance for dissimilar ones in a latent space. However, this approach struggles to ensure accurate distance-based image similarity representation, particularly when training with binary pairwise labels, and complex re-ranking strategies are required. This work introduces a fresh perspective by framing place recognition as a regression problem, using camera field-of-view overlap as similarity ground truth for learning. By optimizing image descriptors to align directly with graded similarity labels, this approach enhances ranking capabilities without expensive re-ranking, offering data-efficient training and strong generalization across several benchmark datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in ICRA 2024</p></details> |
| **[Learning Sequence Descriptor based on Spatio-Temporal Attention for Visual Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11467v4)** | 2024-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Place Recognition (VPR) aims to retrieve frames from a geotagged database that are located at the same place as the query frame. To improve the robustness of VPR in perceptually aliasing scenarios, sequence-based VPR methods are proposed. These methods are either based on matching between frame sequences or extracting sequence descriptors for direct retrieval. However, the former is usually based on the assumption of constant velocity, which is difficult to hold in practice, and is computationally expensive and subject to sequence length. Although the latter overcomes these problems, existing sequence descriptors are constructed by aggregating features of multiple frames only, without interaction on temporal information, and thus cannot obtain descriptors with spatio-temporal discrimination.In this paper, we propose a sequence descriptor that effectively incorporates spatio-temporal information. Specifically, spatial attention within the same frame is utilized to learn spatial feature patterns, while attention in corresponding local regions of different frames is utilized to learn the persistence or change of features over time. We use a sliding window to control the temporal range of attention and use relative positional encoding to construct sequential relationships between different features. This allows our descriptors to capture the intrinsic dynamics in a sequence of frames.Comprehensive experiments on challenging benchmark datasets show that the proposed approach outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods.The code is available at https://github.com/tiev-tongji/Spatio-Temporal-SeqVPR.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, published to RA-L</p></details> |

The proposed approach is formulated as a minimization problem in terms of dominating set algorithm for graph, constructed from spatial information, and referred as DominatingSet. Our algorithm shows better scene coverage in comparison to other methodologies that are used for database creation. Also, we demonstrate that using DominatingSet, a database size could be up to 250-1400 times smaller than the original scanning sequence while maintaining a recall rate of more than 80% on testing sequences. We evaluated our algorithm on 7-scenes and BundleFusion datasets and an additionally recorded sequence in a highly repetitive office setting. In addition, the database selection can produce weakly-supervised labels for fine-tuning neural place recognition algorithms to particular settings, improving even more their accuracy. The paper also presents a fully automated pipeline for VPR database creation from RGBD scanning sequences, as well as a set of metrics for VPR database evaluation.

| **[Multi-Technique Sequential Information Consistency For Dynamic Visual Place Recognition In Changing Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08263v1)** | 2024-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual place recognition (VPR) is an essential component of robot navigation and localization systems that allows them to identify a place using only image data. VPR is challenging due to the significant changes in a place's appearance driven by different daily illumination, seasonal weather variations and diverse viewpoints. Currently, no single VPR technique excels in every environmental condition, each exhibiting unique benefits and shortcomings, and therefore combining multiple techniques can achieve more reliable VPR performance. Present multi-method approaches either rely on online ground-truth information, which is often not available, or on brute-force technique combination, potentially lowering performance with high variance technique sets. Addressing these shortcomings, we propose a VPR system dubbed Multi-Sequential Information Consistency (MuSIC) which leverages sequential information to select the most cohesive technique on an online per-frame basis. For each technique in a set, MuSIC computes their respective sequential consistencies by analysing the frame-to-frame continuity of their top match candidates, which are then directly compared to select the optimal technique for the current query image. The use of sequential information to select between VPR methods results in an overall VPR performance increase across different benchmark datasets, while avoiding the need for extra ground-truth of the runtime environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2303.14247</p></details> |

While state-of-the-art approaches are trained in a supervised manner and therefore hardly capture the information needed for generalizing to unusual conditions, we argue that self-supervised learning may help abstracting the place representation so that it can be foreseen, irrespective of the conditions. More precisely, in this paper, we investigate learning features that are robust to appearance modifications while sensitive to geometric transformations in a self-supervised manner. This dual-purpose training is made possible by combining the two self-supervision main paradigms, \textit{i.e.} contrastive and predictive learning. Our results on standard benchmarks reveal that jointly learning such appearance-robust and geometry-sensitive image descriptors leads to competitive visual place recognition results across adverse seasonal and illumination conditions, without requiring any human-annotated labels.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 figures, WACV 2024</p></details> |

While VPR techniques built upon a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) backbone dominate state-of-the-art VPR performance, their high computational requirements make them unsuitable for platforms equipped with low-end hardware. Recently, a lightweight VPR system based on multiple bio-inspired classifiers, dubbed DrosoNets, has been proposed, achieving great computational efficiency at the cost of reduced absolute place retrieval performance. In this work, we propose a novel multi-DrosoNet localization system, dubbed RegionDrosoNet, with significantly improved VPR performance, while preserving a low-computational profile. Our approach relies on specializing distinct groups of DrosoNets on differently sliced partitions of the original image, increasing extrinsic model differentiation. Furthermore, we introduce a novel voting module to combine the outputs of all DrosoNets into the final place prediction which considers multiple top refence candidates from each DrosoNet. RegionDrosoNet outperforms other lightweight VPR techniques when dealing with both appearance changes and viewpoint variations. Moreover, it competes with computationally expensive methods on some benchmark datasets at a small fraction of their online inference time.</p></details> |  |

Nonetheless, integrating additional sensors comes with elevated costs and may not be feasible for systems that demand lightweight operation, thereby impacting the practical deployment of VPR. To address this issue, we resort to knowledge distillation, which empowers single-modal students to learn from cross-modal teachers without introducing additional sensors during inference. Despite the notable advancements achieved by current distillation approaches, the exploration of feature relationships remains an under-explored area. In order to tackle the challenge of cross-modal distillation in VPR, we present DistilVPR, a novel distillation pipeline for VPR. We propose leveraging feature relationships from multiple agents, including self-agents and cross-agents for teacher and student neural networks. Furthermore, we integrate various manifolds, characterized by different space curvatures for exploring feature relationships. This approach enhances the diversity of feature relationships, including Euclidean, spherical, and hyperbolic relationship modules, thereby enhancing the overall representational capacity. The experiments demonstrate that our proposed pipeline achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other distillation baselines. We also conduct necessary ablation studies to show design effectiveness.

| **[Design Space Exploration of Low-Bit Quantized Neural Networks for Visual Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09028v1)** | 2023-12-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is a critical task for performing global re-localization in visual perception systems. It requires the ability to accurately recognize a previously visited location under variations such as illumination, occlusion, appearance and viewpoint. In the case of robotic systems and augmented reality, the target devices for deployment are battery powered edge devices. Therefore whilst the accuracy of VPR methods is important so too is memory consumption and latency. Recently new works have focused on the recall@1 metric as a performance measure with limited focus on resource utilization. This has resulted in methods that use deep learning models too large to deploy on low powered edge devices. We hypothesize that these large models are highly over-parameterized and can be optimized to satisfy the constraints of a low powered embedded system whilst maintaining high recall performance. Our work studies the impact of compact convolutional network architecture design in combination with full-precision and mixed-precision post-training quantization on VPR performance. Importantly we not only measure performance via the recall@1 score but also measure memory consumption and latency. We characterize the design implications on memory, latency and recall scores and provide a number of design recommendations for VPR systems under these resource limitations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Divide&Classify: Fine-Grained Classification for City-Wide Visual Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08417v2)** | 2023-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Place recognition is commonly addressed as an image retrieval problem. However, retrieval methods are impractical to scale to large datasets, densely sampled from city-wide maps, since their dimension impact negatively on the inference time. Using approximate nearest neighbour search for retrieval helps to mitigate this issue, at the cost of a performance drop. In this paper we investigate whether we can effectively approach this task as a classification problem, thus bypassing the need for a similarity search. We find that existing classification methods for coarse, planet-wide localization are not suitable for the fine-grained and city-wide setting. This is largely due to how the dataset is split into classes, because these methods are designed to handle a sparse distribution of photos and as such do not consider the visual aliasing problem across neighbouring classes that naturally arises in dense scenarios. Thus, we propose a partitioning scheme that enables a fast and accurate inference, preserving a simple learning procedure, and a novel inference pipeline based on an ensemble of novel classifiers that uses the prototypes learned via an angular margin loss. Our method, Divide&Classify (D&C), enjoys the fast inference of classification solutions and an accuracy competitive with retrieval methods on the fine-grained, city-wide setting. Moreover, we show that D&C can be paired with existing retrieval pipelines to speed up computations by over 20 times while increasing their recall, leading to new state-of-the-art results.</p></details> | Accepted to ICCV23 |

Although most current VPR methods achieve favorable results under ideal conditions, their performance in complex environments, characterized by lighting variations, seasonal changes, and occlusions caused by moving objects, is generally unsatisfactory. In this study, we utilize the DINOv2 model as the backbone network for trimming and fine-tuning to extract robust image features. We propose a novel VPR architecture called DINO-Mix, which combines a foundational vision model with feature aggregation. This architecture relies on the powerful image feature extraction capabilities of foundational vision models. We employ an MLP-Mixer-based mix module to aggregate image features, resulting in globally robust and generalizable descriptors that enable high-precision VPR. We experimentally demonstrate that the proposed DINO-Mix architecture significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. In test sets having lighting variations, seasonal changes, and occlusions (Tokyo24/7, Nordland, SF-XL-Testv1), our proposed DINO-Mix architecture achieved Top-1 accuracy rates of 91.75%, 80.18%, and 82%, respectively.

To date, the most performant VPR approaches are environment- and task-specific: while they exhibit strong performance in structured environments (predominantly urban driving), their performance degrades severely in unstructured environments, rendering most approaches brittle to robust real-world deployment. In this work, we develop a universal solution to VPR -- a technique that works across a broad range of structured and unstructured environments (urban, outdoors, indoors, aerial, underwater, and subterranean environments) without any re-training or fine-tuning. We demonstrate that general-purpose feature representations derived from off-the-shelf self-supervised models with no VPR-specific training are the right substrate upon which to build such a universal VPR solution. Combining these derived features with unsupervised feature aggregation enables our suite of methods, AnyLoc, to achieve up to 4X significantly higher performance than existing approaches. We further obtain a 6% improvement in performance by characterizing the semantic properties of these features, uncovering unique domains which encapsulate datasets from similar environments. Our detailed experiments and analysis lay a foundation for building VPR solutions that may be deployed anywhere, anytime, and across anyview.

It aims to summarize a long video walkthrough of a scene into a small set of frames that are spatially diverse in the scene, which has many impotant applications, such as in surveillance, real estate, and robotics. It stems from video summarization but focuses on long and continuous videos from moving cameras, instead of user-edited fragmented video clips that are more commonly studied in existing video summarization works. Our solution to this task is a two-stage self-supervised pipeline named SceneSum. Its first stage uses clustering to segment the video sequence. Our key idea is to combine visual place recognition (VPR) into this clustering process to promote spatial diversity. Its second stage needs to select a representative keyframe from each cluster as the summary while respecting resource constraints such as memory and disk space limits. Additionally, if the ground truth image trajectory is available, our method can be easily augmented with a supervised loss to enhance the clustering and keyframe selection. Extensive experiments on both real-world and simulated datasets show our method outperforms common video summarization baselines by 50%</p></details> |  |

While existing works make remarkable progress on day-night domain adaptation, they rely heavily on domain knowledge derived from the task-specific nighttime dataset. This paper challenges a more complicated scenario with border applicability, i.e., zero-shot day-night domain adaptation, which eliminates reliance on any nighttime data. Unlike prior zero-shot adaptation approaches emphasizing either image-level translation or model-level adaptation, we propose a similarity min-max paradigm that considers them under a unified framework. On the image level, we darken images towards minimum feature similarity to enlarge the domain gap. Then on the model level, we maximize the feature similarity between the darkened images and their normal-light counterparts for better model adaptation. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the pioneering effort in jointly optimizing both aspects, resulting in a significant improvement of model generalizability. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method's effectiveness and broad applicability on various nighttime vision tasks, including classification, semantic segmentation, visual place recognition, and video action recognition.

Current methods either rely heavily on GNSS, face limitations in visual-based localization due to appearance variances and stylistic dissimilarities between camera and reference imagery, or operate under the assumption of a known initial pose. In this paper, we developed a GNSS-denied localization approach for UAVs that harnesses both Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) and Visual Place Recognition (VPR) using a foundation model. This paper presents a novel vision-based pipeline that works exclusively with a nadir-facing camera, an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), and pre-existing satellite imagery for robust, accurate localization in varied environments and conditions. Our system demonstrated average localization accuracy within a $20$-meter range, with a minimum error below $1$ meter, under real-world conditions marked by drastic changes in environmental appearance and with no assumption of the vehicle's initial pose. The method is proven to be effective and robust, addressing the crucial need for reliable UAV localization in GNSS-denied environments, while also being computationally efficient enough to be deployed on resource-constrained platforms.</p></details> |  |

Recently, an approach for synthesizing database images from unseen viewpoints using NeRF (Neural Radiance Fields) technology has emerged with impressive performance. However, synthesized images provided by these techniques are often of lower quality than the original images, and furthermore they significantly increase the storage cost of the database. In this study, we explore a new hybrid scene model that combines the advantages of view-invariant appearance features computed from raw images and view-dependent spatial-semantic features computed from synthesized images. These two types of features are then fused into scene graphs, and compressively learned and recognized by a graph neural network. The effectiveness of the proposed method was verified using a novel cross-view self-localization dataset with many unseen views generated using a photorealistic Habitat simulator.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 5 figures, technical report</p></details> |

VPR is particularly difficult due to the presence of duplicate regions and the lack of attention to small objects in complex scenes, resulting in recognition deviations. In this paper, we present ClusVPR, a novel approach that tackles the specific issues of redundant information in duplicate regions and representations of small objects. Different from existing methods that rely on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature map generation, ClusVPR introduces a unique paradigm called Clustering-based Weighted Transformer Network (CWTNet). CWTNet leverages the power of clustering-based weighted feature maps and integrates global dependencies to effectively address visual deviations encountered in large-scale VPR problems. We also introduce the optimized-VLAD (OptLAD) layer that significantly reduces the number of parameters and enhances model efficiency. This layer is specifically designed to aggregate the information obtained from scale-wise image patches. Additionally, our pyramid self-supervised strategy focuses on extracting representative and diverse information from scale-wise image patches instead of entire images, which is crucial for capturing representative and diverse information in VPR. Extensive experiments on four VPR datasets show our model's superior performance compared to existing models while being less complex.</p></details> |  |

Most research efforts focus on enhancing the accuracy and robustness of single-robot VPR but often encounter issues such as occlusion due to individual viewpoints. Despite a number of research on multi-robot metric-based localization, there is a notable gap in research concerning more robust and efficient place-based localization with a multi-robot system. This work proposes collaborative VPR, where multiple robots share abstracted visual features to enhance place recognition capabilities. We also introduce a novel collaborative VPR framework based on similarity-regularized information fusion, reducing irrelevant noise while harnessing valuable data from collaborators. This framework seamlessly integrates with well-established single-robot VPR techniques and supports end-to-end training with a weakly-supervised contrastive loss. We conduct experiments in urban, rural, and indoor scenes, achieving a notable improvement over single-agent VPR in urban environments (~12\%), along with consistent enhancements in rural (~3\%) and indoor (~1\%) scenarios.

Recently, the hierarchical two-stage VPR methods have become popular in this field due to the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. These methods retrieve the top-k candidate images using the global features in the first stage, then re-rank the candidates by matching the local features in the second stage. However, they usually require additional algorithms (e.g. RANSAC) for geometric consistency verification in re-ranking, which is time-consuming. Here we propose a Dynamically Aligning Local Features (DALF) algorithm to align the local features under spatial constraints. It is significantly more efficient than the methods that need geometric consistency verification. We present a unified network capable of extracting global features for retrieving candidates via an aggregation module and aligning local features for re-ranking via the DALF alignment module. We call this network AANet. Meanwhile, many works use the simplest positive samples in triplet for weakly supervised training, which limits the ability of the network to recognize harder positive pairs. To address this issue, we propose a Semi-hard Positive Sample Mining (ShPSM) strategy to select appropriate hard positive images for training more robust VPR networks. Extensive experiments on four benchmark VPR datasets show that the proposed AANet can outperform several state-of-the-art methods with less time consumption.

This is typically done through image retrieval, where the query is matched to the most similar images from a large database of geotagged photos, using learned global descriptors. A major challenge in this task is recognizing places seen from different viewpoints. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new method, called EigenPlaces, to train our neural network on images from different point of views, which embeds viewpoint robustness into the learned global descriptors. The underlying idea is to cluster the training data so as to explicitly present the model with different views of the same points of interest. The selection of this points of interest is done without the need for extra supervision.

| **[Visual Place Recognition: A Tutorial](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03281v2)** | 2023-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Localization is an essential capability for mobile robots. A rapidly growing field of research in this area is Visual Place Recognition (VPR), which is the ability to recognize previously seen places in the world based solely on images. This present work is the first tutorial paper on visual place recognition. It unifies the terminology of VPR and complements prior research in two important directions: 1) It provides a systematic introduction for newcomers to the field, covering topics such as the formulation of the VPR problem, a general-purpose algorithmic pipeline, an evaluation methodology for VPR approaches, and the major challenges for VPR and how they may be addressed. 2) As a contribution for researchers acquainted with the VPR problem, it examines the intricacies of different VPR problem types regarding input, data processing, and output. The tutorial also discusses the subtleties behind the evaluation of VPR algorithms, e.g., the evaluation of a VPR system that has to find all matching database images per query, as opposed to just a single match. Practical code examples in Python illustrate to prospective practitioners and researchers how VPR is implemented and evaluated.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Robotics & Automation Magazine (RAM)</p></details> |

Currently, the two main approaches are the perspective view retrieval (P2P) paradigm and the equirectangular image retrieval (E2E) paradigm. However, it is practical and natural to assume that users only have consumer-grade pinhole cameras to obtain query perspective images and retrieve them in panoramic database images from map providers. To address this, we propose \textit{PanoVPR}, a perspective-to-equirectangular (P2E) visual place recognition framework that employs sliding windows to eliminate feature truncation caused by hard cropping. Specifically, PanoVPR slides windows over the entire equirectangular image and computes feature descriptors for each window, which are then compared to determine place similarity. Notably, our unified framework enables direct transfer of the backbone from P2P methods without any modification, supporting not only CNNs but also Transformers. To facilitate training and evaluation, we derive the Pitts250k-P2E dataset from the Pitts250k and establish YQ360, latter is the first P2E visual place recognition dataset collected by a mobile robot platform aiming to simulate real-world task scenarios better. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PanoVPR achieves state-of-the-art performance and obtains 3.8% and 8.0% performance gain on Pitts250k-P2E and YQ360 compared to the previous best method, respectively.

In this research we present a new, training-free approach to predicting the likely quality of localization estimates, and a novel method for using these predictions to bias a sequence-matching process to produce additional performance gains beyond that of a naive sequence matching approach. Our combined system is lightweight, runs in real-time and is agnostic to the underlying VPR technique. On extensive experiments across four datasets and three VPR techniques, we demonstrate our system improves precision performance, especially at the high-precision/low-recall operating point. We also present ablation and analysis identifying the performance contributions of the prediction and weighted sequence matching components in isolation, and the relationship between the quality of the prediction system and the benefits of the weighted sequential matcher.</p></details> |  |

One of the biggest challenges is that it may suffer from illumination or appearance changes in surrounding environments. Event cameras are interesting alternatives to frame-based sensors as their high dynamic range enables robust perception in difficult illumination conditions. However, current event-based place recognition methods only rely on event information, which restricts downstream applications of VPR. In this paper, we present the first cross-modal visual place recognition framework that is capable of retrieving regular images from a database given an event query. Our method demonstrates promising results with respect to the state-of-the-art frame-based and event-based methods on the Brisbane-Event-VPR dataset under different scenarios. We also verify the effectiveness of the combination of retrieval and classification, which can boost performance by a large margin.</p></details> |  |

In this work we investigate whether a prior map can be leveraged to aid in the detection of dynamic objects in a scene without the need for a 3D map or pixel-level map-query correspondences. We contribute an algorithm which refines an initial set of candidate object detections and produces a refined subset of highly accurate detections using a prior map. We begin by using visual place recognition (VPR) to retrieve a reference map image for a given query image, then use a binary classification neural network that compares the query and mapping image regions to validate the query detection. Once our classification network is trained, on approximately 1000 query-map image pairs, it is able to improve the performance of vehicle detection when combined with an existing off-the-shelf vehicle detector. We demonstrate our approach using standard datasets across two cities (Oxford and Zurich) under different settings of train-test separation of map-query traverse pairs. We further emphasize the performance gains of our approach against alternative design choices and show that VPR suffices for the task, eliminating the need for precise ground truth localization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IROS 2023</p></details> |

We propose a novel network architecture that utilizes the BEV representation in feature extraction, feature aggregation, and vision-LiDAR fusion, which bridges visual cues and spatial awareness. Our method extracts image features using standard convolutional networks and combines the features according to pre-defined 3D grid spatial points. To alleviate the mechanical and time misalignments between cameras, we further introduce deformable attention to learn the compensation. Upon the BEV feature representation, we then employ the polar transform and the Discrete Fourier transform for aggregation, which is shown to be rotation-invariant. In addition, the image and point cloud cues can be easily stated in the same coordinates, which benefits sensor fusion for place recognition. The proposed BEV-based method is evaluated in ablation and comparative studies on two datasets, including on-the-road and off-the-road scenarios. The experimental results verify the hypothesis that BEV can benefit VPR by its superior performance compared to baseline methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first trial of employing BEV representation in this task.</p></details> |  |

With the widespread availability of compact cameras, visual information has become increasingly popular for addressing the localisation problem, which is then termed as Visual Place Recognition (VPR). While many applications use high-resolution cameras and high-end systems to achieve optimal place-matching performance, low-end commercial systems face limitations due to resource constraints and relatively low-resolution and low-quality cameras. In this paper, we analyse the effects of image resolution on the accuracy and robustness of well-established handcrafted VPR pipelines. Handcrafted designs have low computational demands and can adapt to flexible image resolutions, making them a suitable approach to scale to any image source and to operate under resource limitations. This paper aims to help academic researchers and companies in the hardware and software industry co-design VPR solutions and expand the use of VPR algorithms in commercial products.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been accepted for presentation at the Active Methods in Autonomous Navigation Workshop, part of the 2023 International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)</p></details> |
| **[An Evaluation and Ranking of Different Voting Schemes for Improved Visual Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05705v1)** | 2023-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Place Recognition has recently seen a surge of endeavours utilizing different ensemble approaches to improve VPR performance. Ideas like multi-process fusion or switching involve combining different VPR techniques together, utilizing different strategies. One major aspect often common to many of these strategies is voting. Voting is widely used in many ensemble methods, so it is potentially a relevant subject to explore in terms of its application and significance for improving VPR performance. This paper attempts to looks into detail and analyze a variety of voting schemes to evaluate which voting technique is optimal for an ensemble VPR set up. We take inspiration from a variety of voting schemes that exist and are widely employed in other research fields such as politics and sociology. The idea is inspired by an observation that different voting methods result in different outcomes for the same type of data and each voting scheme is utilized for specific cases in different academic fields. Some of these voting schemes include Condorcet voting, Broda Count and Plurality voting. Voting employed in any aspect requires that a fair system be established, that outputs the best and most favourable results which in our case would involve improving VPR performance. We evaluate some of these voting techniques in a standardized testing of different VPR techniques, using a variety of VPR data sets. We aim to determine whether a single optimal voting scheme exists or, much like in other fields of research, the selection of a voting technique is relative to its application and environment. We also aim to propose a ranking of these different voting methods from best to worst according to our results as this will allow for better selection of voting schemes.</p></details> |  |

While Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) currently dominate state-of-the-art VPR performance, their high computational requirements make them unsuitable for platforms with budget or size constraints. This has spurred the development of lightweight algorithms, such as DrosoNet, which employs a voting system based on multiple bio-inspired units. In this paper, we present a novel training approach for DrosoNet, wherein separate models are trained on distinct regions of a reference image, allowing them to specialize in the visual features of that specific section. Additionally, we introduce a convolutional-like prediction method, in which each DrosoNet unit generates a set of place predictions for each portion of the query image. These predictions are then combined using the previously introduced voting system. Our approach significantly improves upon the VPR performance of previous work while maintaining an extremely compact and lightweight algorithm, making it suitable for resource-constrained platforms.</p></details> |  |
| **[City-Scale Visual Place Recognition with Deep Local Features Based on Multi-Scale Ordered VLAD Pooling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.09255v2)** | 2023-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual place recognition is the task of recognizing a place depicted in an image based on its pure visual appearance without metadata. In visual place recognition, the challenges lie upon not only the changes in lighting conditions, camera viewpoint, and scale but also the characteristic of scene-level images and the distinct features of the area. To resolve these challenges, one must consider both the local discriminativeness and the global semantic context of images. On the other hand, the diversity of the datasets is also particularly important to develop more general models and advance the progress of the field. In this paper, we present a fully-automated system for place recognition at a city-scale based on content-based image retrieval. Our main contributions to the community lie in three aspects. Firstly, we take a comprehensive analysis of visual place recognition and sketch out the unique challenges of the task compared to general image retrieval tasks. Next, we propose yet a simple pooling approach on top of convolutional neural network activations to embed the spatial information into the image representation vector. Finally, we introduce new datasets for place recognition, which are particularly essential for application-based research. Furthermore, throughout extensive experiments, various issues in both image retrieval and place recognition are analyzed and discussed to give some insights into improving the performance of retrieval models in reality.

| **[Generalized Contrastive Optimization of Siamese Networks for Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.06638v4)** | 2023-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual place recognition is a challenging task in computer vision and a key component of camera-based localization and navigation systems. Recently, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) achieved high results and good generalization capabilities. They are usually trained using pairs or triplets of images labeled as either similar or dissimilar, in a binary fashion. In practice, the similarity between two images is not binary, but continuous. Furthermore, training these CNNs is computationally complex and involves costly pair and triplet mining strategies. We propose a Generalized Contrastive loss (GCL) function that relies on image similarity as a continuous measure, and use it to train a siamese CNN. Furthermore, we present three techniques for automatic annotation of image pairs with labels indicating their degree of similarity, and deploy them to re-annotate the MSLS, TB-Places, and 7Scenes datasets. We demonstrate that siamese CNNs trained using the GCL function and the improved annotations consistently outperform their binary counterparts. Our models trained on MSLS outperform the state-of-the-art methods, including NetVLAD, NetVLAD-SARE, AP-GeM and Patch-NetVLAD, and generalize well on the Pittsburgh30k, Tokyo 24/7, RobotCar Seasons v2 and Extended CMU Seasons datasets. Furthermore, training a siamese network using the GCL function does not require complex pair mining.

In real-world applications, extreme illumination changes caused by query images taken at night pose a significant obstacle that VPR needs to overcome. However, a training set with day-night correspondence for city-scale, street-level VPR does not exist. To address this challenge, we propose a novel pipeline that divides VPR and conquers Nocturnal Place Recognition (NPR). Specifically, we first established a street-level day-night dataset, NightStreet, and used it to train an unpaired image-to-image translation model. Then we used this model to process existing large-scale VPR datasets to generate the VPR-Night datasets and demonstrated how to combine them with two popular VPR pipelines. Finally, we proposed a divide-and-conquer VPR framework and provided explanations at the theoretical, experimental, and application levels. Under our framework, previous methods can significantly improve performance on two public datasets, including the top-ranked method.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |

In this work, we look into two fundamental bottlenecks for its localization accuracy: reference map sparseness and viewpoint invariance. Firstly, the reference images for VPR are only available at sparse poses in a map, which enforces an upper bound on the maximum achievable localization accuracy through VPR. We therefore propose Continuous Place-descriptor Regression (CoPR) to densify the map and improve localization accuracy. We study various interpolation and extrapolation models to regress additional VPR feature descriptors from only the existing references. Secondly, we compare different feature encoders and show that CoPR presents value for all of them. We evaluate our models on three existing public datasets and report on average around 30% improvement in VPR-based localization accuracy using CoPR, on top of the 15% increase by using a viewpoint-variant loss for the feature encoder. The complementary relation between CoPR and Relative Pose Estimation is also discussed.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the IEEE Transactions on Robotics, April 2023</p></details> |

Despite the tremendous progress made in recent years, place recognition in changing environments remains challenging. A promising approach to cope with appearance variations is to leverage high-level semantic features like objects or place categories. In this paper, we propose FM-Loc which is a novel image-based localization approach based on Foundation Models that uses the Large Language Model GPT-3 in combination with the Visual-Language Model CLIP to construct a semantic image descriptor that is robust to severe changes in scene geometry and camera viewpoint. We deploy CLIP to detect objects in an image, GPT-3 to suggest potential room labels based on the detected objects, and CLIP again to propose the most likely location label. The object labels and the scene label constitute an image descriptor that we use to calculate a similarity score between the query and database images. We validate our approach on real-world data that exhibit significant changes in camera viewpoints and object placement between the database and query trajectories. The experimental results demonstrate that our method is applicable to a wide range of indoor scenarios without the need for training or fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Are Local Features All You Need for Cross-Domain Visual Place Recognition?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05887v1)** | 2023-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Place Recognition is a task that aims to predict the coordinates of an image (called query) based solely on visual clues. Most commonly, a retrieval approach is adopted, where the query is matched to the most similar images from a large database of geotagged photos, using learned global descriptors. Despite recent advances, recognizing the same place when the query comes from a significantly different distribution is still a major hurdle for state of the art retrieval methods. Examples are heavy illumination changes (e.g. night-time images) or substantial occlusions (e.g. transient objects). In this work we explore whether re-ranking methods based on spatial verification can tackle these challenges, following the intuition that local descriptors are inherently more robust than global features to domain shifts. To this end, we provide a new, comprehensive benchmark on current state of the art models. We also introduce two new demanding datasets with night and occluded queries, to be matched against a city-wide database. Code and datasets are available at https://github.com/gbarbarani/re-ranking-for-VPR.</p></details> | CVPRW 2023 |

Conventional methods generally adopt aggregated CNN features for global retrieval and RANSAC-based geometric verification for reranking. However, RANSAC only employs geometric information but ignores other possible information that could be useful for reranking, e.g. local feature correlations, and attention values. In this paper, we propose a unified place recognition framework that handles both retrieval and reranking with a novel transformer model, named $R^{2}$Former. The proposed reranking module takes feature correlation, attention value, and xy coordinates into account, and learns to determine whether the image pair is from the same location. The whole pipeline is end-to-end trainable and the reranking module alone can also be adopted on other CNN or transformer backbones as a generic component. Remarkably, $R^{2}$Former significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on major VPR datasets with much less inference time and memory consumption. It also achieves the state-of-the-art on the hold-out MSLS challenge set and could serve as a simple yet strong solution for real-world large-scale applications. Experiments also show vision transformer tokens are comparable and sometimes better than CNN local features on local matching. The code is released at https://github.com/Jeff-Zilence/R2Former.</p></details> | CVPR |
| **[Data-efficient Large Scale Place Recognition with Graded Similarity Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11739v2)** | 2023-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual place recognition (VPR) is a fundamental task of computer vision for visual localization. Existing methods are trained using image pairs that either depict the same place or not. Such a binary indication does not consider continuous relations of similarity between images of the same place taken from different positions, determined by the continuous nature of camera pose. The binary similarity induces a noisy supervision signal into the training of VPR methods, which stall in local minima and require expensive hard mining algorithms to guarantee convergence. Motivated by the fact that two images of the same place only partially share visual cues due to camera pose differences, we deploy an automatic re-annotation strategy to re-label VPR datasets. We compute graded similarity labels for image pairs based on available localization metadata. Furthermore, we propose a new Generalized Contrastive Loss (GCL) that uses graded similarity labels for training contrastive networks. We demonstrate that the use of the new labels and GCL allow to dispense from hard-pair mining, and to train image descriptors that perform better in VPR by nearest neighbor search, obtaining superior or comparable results than methods that require expensive hard-pair mining and re-ranking techniques.

VPR is challenging due to the significant changes in a place's appearance under different illumination throughout the day, with seasonal weather and when observed from different viewpoints. Currently, no single VPR technique excels in every environmental condition, each exhibiting unique benefits and shortcomings. As a result, VPR systems combining multiple techniques achieve more reliable VPR performance in changing environments, at the cost of higher computational loads. Addressing this shortcoming, we propose an adaptive VPR system dubbed Adaptive Multi-Self Identification and Correction (A-MuSIC). We start by developing a method to collect information of the runtime performance of a VPR technique by analysing the frame-to-frame continuity of matched queries. We then demonstrate how to operate the method on a static ensemble of techniques, generating data on which techniques are contributing the most for the current environment. A-MuSIC uses the collected information to both select a minimal subset of techniques and to decide when a re-selection is required during navigation. A-MuSIC matches or beats state-of-the-art VPR performance across all tested benchmark datasets while maintaining its computational load on par with individual techniques.</p></details> |  |

Limited by existing training frameworks, most deep learning-based works cannot extract sufficiently stable global features from RGB images and rely on a time-consuming re-ranking step to exploit spatial structural information for better performance. In this paper, we propose StructVPR, a novel training architecture for VPR, to enhance structural knowledge in RGB global features and thus improve feature stability in a constantly changing environment. Specifically, StructVPR uses segmentation images as a more definitive source of structural knowledge input into a CNN network and applies knowledge distillation to avoid online segmentation and inference of seg-branch in testing. Considering that not all samples contain high-quality and helpful knowledge, and some even hurt the performance of distillation, we partition samples and weigh each sample's distillation loss to enhance the expected knowledge precisely. Finally, StructVPR achieves impressive performance on several benchmarks using only global retrieval and even outperforms many two-stage approaches by a large margin. After adding additional re-ranking, ours achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining a low computational cost.</p></details> | accepted by CVPR2023 |

However, efficient real-time map reconstruction with data streamed from multiple robots and devices remains a challenge. To that end, we propose HAMMER, a server-based collaborative Gaussian Splatting method that leverages widely available ROS communication infrastructure to generate 3D, metric-semantic maps from asynchronous robot data-streams with no prior knowledge of initial robot positions and varying on-device pose estimators. HAMMER consists of (i) a frame alignment module that transforms local SLAM poses and image data into a global frame and requires no prior relative pose knowledge, and (ii) an online module for training semantic 3DGS maps from streaming data. HAMMER handles mixed perception modes, adjusts automatically for variations in image pre-processing among different devices, and distills CLIP semantic codes into the 3D scene for open-vocabulary language queries. In our real-world experiments, HAMMER creates higher-fidelity maps (2x) compared to competing baselines and is useful for downstream tasks, such as semantic goal-conditioned navigation (e.g., ``go to the couch").

| **[3DGSR: Implicit Surface Reconstruction with 3D Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00409v2)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present an implicit surface reconstruction method with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), namely 3DGSR, that allows for accurate 3D reconstruction with intricate details while inheriting the high efficiency and rendering quality of 3DGS. The key insight is incorporating an implicit signed distance field (SDF) within 3D Gaussians to enable them to be aligned and jointly optimized. First, we introduce a differentiable SDF-to-opacity transformation function that converts SDF values into corresponding Gaussians' opacities. This function connects the SDF and 3D Gaussians, allowing for unified optimization and enforcing surface constraints on the 3D Gaussians. During learning, optimizing the 3D Gaussians provides supervisory signals for SDF learning, enabling the reconstruction of intricate details. However, this only provides sparse supervisory signals to the SDF at locations occupied by Gaussians, which is insufficient for learning a continuous SDF. Then, to address this limitation, we incorporate volumetric rendering and align the rendered geometric attributes (depth, normal) with those derived from 3D Gaussians. This consistency regularization introduces supervisory signals to locations not covered by discrete 3D Gaussians, effectively eliminating redundant surfaces outside the Gaussian sampling range. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that our 3DGSR method enables high-quality 3D surface reconstruction while preserving the efficiency and rendering quality of 3DGS. Besides, our method competes favorably with leading surface reconstruction techniques while offering a more efficient learning process and much better rendering qualities. The code will be available at https://github.com/CVMI-Lab/3DGSR.</p></details> |  |

However, it typically requires large storage capacity and high VRAM, demanding the design of effective pruning and compression techniques. Existing methods, while effective in some scenarios, struggle with scalability and fail to adapt models based on critical factors such as computing capabilities or bandwidth, requiring to re-train the model under different configurations. In this work, we propose a novel, model-agnostic technique that organizes Gaussians into several hierarchical layers, enabling progressive Level of Detail (LoD) strategy. This method, combined with recent approach of compression of 3DGS, allows a single model to instantly scale across several compression ratios, with minimal to none impact to quality compared to a single non-scalable model and without requiring re-training. We validate our approach on typical datasets and benchmarks, showcasing low distortion and substantial gains in terms of scalability and adaptability.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose MultiDreamer3D that can generate coherent multi-concept 3D content in a divide-and-conquer manner. First, we generate 3D bounding boxes using an LLM-based layout controller. Next, a selective point cloud generator creates coarse point clouds for each concept. These point clouds are placed in the 3D bounding boxes and initialized into 3D Gaussian Splatting with concept labels, enabling precise identification of concept attributions in 2D projections. Finally, we refine 3D Gaussians via concept-aware interval score matching, guided by concept-aware diffusion. Our experimental results show that MultiDreamer3D not only ensures object presence and preserves the distinct identities of each concept but also successfully handles complex cases such as property change or interaction. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to address the multi-concept customization in 3D.</p></details> | 9 pages |

However, existing 3DGS methods often struggle to accurately reconstruct a 3D map that reflects the actual scale and geometry of the real world, which degrades localization performance. To address these limitations, we propose a novel 3DGS method called Geometry-Aware Gaussian Splatting (GeomGS). This method fully integrates LiDAR data into 3D Gaussian primitives via a probabilistic approach, as opposed to approaches that only use LiDAR as initial points or introduce simple constraints for Gaussian points. To this end, we introduce a Geometric Confidence Score (GCS), which identifies the structural reliability of each Gaussian point. The GCS is optimized simultaneously with Gaussians under probabilistic distance constraints to construct a precise structure. Furthermore, we propose a novel localization method that fully utilizes both the geometric and photometric properties of GeomGS. Our GeomGS demonstrates state-of-the-art geometric and localization performance across several benchmarks, while also improving photometric performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, Under review</p></details> |

While these approaches can build highly realistic maps, large-scale SLAM still remains a challenge because they require a large number of Gaussian images for mapping and adjacent images as keyframes for tracking. We propose a novel 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM method, VIGS SLAM, that utilizes sensor fusion of RGB-D and IMU sensors for large-scale indoor environments. To reduce the computational load of 3DGS-based tracking, we adopt an ICP-based tracking framework that combines IMU preintegration to provide a good initial guess for accurate pose estimation. Our proposed method is the first to propose that Gaussian Splatting-based SLAM can be effectively performed in large-scale environments by integrating IMU sensor measurements. This proposal not only enhances the performance of Gaussian Splatting SLAM beyond room-scale scenarios but also achieves SLAM performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods in large-scale indoor environments.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |

Motion blur is prevalent in real-world dynamic video capture, especially due to human movements in 3D human avatar modeling. Existing methods either (1) assume sharp image inputs, failing to address the detail loss introduced by motion blur, or (2) mainly consider blur by camera movements, neglecting the human motion blur which is more common in animatable avatars. Our proposed approach integrates a human movement-based motion blur model into 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). By explicitly modeling human motion trajectories during exposure time, we jointly optimize the trajectories and 3D Gaussians to reconstruct sharp, high-quality human avatars. We employ a pose-dependent fusion mechanism to distinguish moving body regions, optimizing both blurred and sharp areas effectively. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that Deblur-Avatar significantly outperforms existing methods in rendering quality and quantitative metrics, producing sharp avatar reconstructions and enabling real-time rendering under challenging motion blur conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[3DGS$^2$: Near Second-order Converging 3D Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13975v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a mainstream solution for novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction. By explicitly encoding a 3D scene using a collection of Gaussian kernels, 3DGS achieves high-quality rendering with superior efficiency. As a learning-based approach, 3DGS training has been dealt with the standard stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method, which offers at most linear convergence. Consequently, training often requires tens of minutes, even with GPU acceleration. This paper introduces a (near) second-order convergent training algorithm for 3DGS, leveraging its unique properties. Our approach is inspired by two key observations. First, the attributes of a Gaussian kernel contribute independently to the image-space loss, which endorses isolated and local optimization algorithms. We exploit this by splitting the optimization at the level of individual kernel attributes, analytically constructing small-size Newton systems for each parameter group, and efficiently solving these systems on GPU threads. This achieves Newton-like convergence per training image without relying on the global Hessian. Second, kernels exhibit sparse and structured coupling across input images. This property allows us to effectively utilize spatial information to mitigate overshoot during stochastic training. Our method converges an order faster than standard GPU-based 3DGS training, requiring over $10\times$ fewer iterations while maintaining or surpassing the quality of the compared with the SGD-based 3DGS reconstructions.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, submit on SIGGRAPH 2025</p></details> |

However, its high storage requirements pose significant challenges for practical applications. We observe that Gaussians exhibit distinct roles and characteristics that are analogous to traditional artistic techniques -- Like how artists first sketch outlines before filling in broader areas with color, some Gaussians capture high-frequency features like edges and contours; While other Gaussians represent broader, smoother regions, that are analogous to broader brush strokes that add volume and depth to a painting. Based on this observation, we propose a novel hybrid representation that categorizes Gaussians into (i) Sketch Gaussians, which define scene boundaries, and (ii) Patch Gaussians, which cover smooth regions. Sketch Gaussians are efficiently encoded using parametric models, leveraging their geometric coherence, while Patch Gaussians undergo optimized pruning, retraining, and vector quantization to maintain volumetric consistency and storage efficiency. Our comprehensive evaluation across diverse indoor and outdoor scenes demonstrates that this structure-aware approach achieves up to 32.62% improvement in PSNR, 19.12% in SSIM, and 45.41% in LPIPS at equivalent model sizes, and correspondingly, for an indoor scene, our model maintains the visual quality with 2.3% of the original model size.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we explore using 2D Gaussian splats as a new primitive for representing videos. We propose GSVC, an approach to learning a set of 2D Gaussian splats that can effectively represent and compress video frames. GSVC incorporates the following techniques: (i) To exploit temporal redundancy among adjacent frames, which can speed up training and improve the compression efficiency, we predict the Gaussian splats of a frame based on its previous frame; (ii) To control the trade-offs between file size and quality, we remove Gaussian splats with low contribution to the video quality; (iii) To capture dynamics in videos, we randomly add Gaussian splats to fit content with large motion or newly-appeared objects; (iv) To handle significant changes in the scene, we detect key frames based on loss differences during the learning process. Experiment results show that GSVC achieves good rate-distortion trade-offs, comparable to state-of-the-art video codecs such as AV1 and VVC, and a rendering speed of 1500 fps for a 1920x1080 video.</p></details> |  |

However, the substantial Gaussians and their associated attributes necessitate effective compression techniques. Nevertheless, the sparse and unorganized nature of the point cloud of Gaussians (or anchors in our paper) presents challenges for compression. To achieve a compact size, we propose HAC++, which leverages the relationships between unorganized anchors and a structured hash grid, utilizing their mutual information for context modeling. Additionally, HAC++ captures intra-anchor contextual relationships to further enhance compression performance. To facilitate entropy coding, we utilize Gaussian distributions to precisely estimate the probability of each quantized attribute, where an adaptive quantization module is proposed to enable high-precision quantization of these attributes for improved fidelity restoration. Moreover, we incorporate an adaptive masking strategy to eliminate invalid Gaussians and anchors. Overall, HAC++ achieves a remarkable size reduction of over 100X compared to vanilla 3DGS when averaged on all datasets, while simultaneously improving fidelity. It also delivers more than 20X size reduction compared to Scaffold-GS.

However, its splatting-based rendering model makes several approximations to the rendering equation, reducing physical accuracy. We show that splatting and its approximations are unnecessary, even within a rasterizer; we instead volumetrically integrate 3D Gaussians directly to compute the transmittance across them analytically. We use this analytic transmittance to derive more physically-accurate alpha values than 3DGS, which can directly be used within their framework. The result is a method that more closely follows the volume rendering equation (similar to ray-tracing) while enjoying the speed benefits of rasterization. Our method represents opaque surfaces with higher accuracy and fewer points than 3DGS. This enables it to outperform 3DGS for view synthesis (measured in SSIM and LPIPS). Being volumetrically consistent also enables our method to work out of the box for tomography. We match the state-of-the-art 3DGS-based tomography method with fewer points.</p></details> |  |
| **[DARB-Splatting: Generalizing Splatting with Decaying Anisotropic Radial Basis Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12369v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Splatting-based 3D reconstruction methods have gained popularity with the advent of 3D Gaussian Splatting, efficiently synthesizing high-quality novel views. These methods commonly resort to using exponential family functions, such as the Gaussian function, as reconstruction kernels due to their anisotropic nature, ease of projection, and differentiability in rasterization. However, the field remains restricted to variations within the exponential family, leaving generalized reconstruction kernels largely underexplored, partly due to the lack of easy integrability in 3D to 2D projections. In this light, we show that a class of decaying anisotropic radial basis functions (DARBFs), which are non-negative functions of the Mahalanobis distance, supports splatting by approximating the Gaussian function's closed-form integration advantage. With this fresh perspective, we demonstrate up to 34% faster convergence during training and a 15% reduction in memory consumption across various DARB reconstruction kernels, while maintaining comparable PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS results. We will make the code available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Link ...</summary><p>Link to the project page: https://randomnerds.github.io/darbs.github.io/</p></details> |

However, in foggy scenes, scattering and attenuation can significantly degrade the reconstruction and rendering quality. Although NeRF-based dehazing reconstruction algorithms have been developed, their use of deep fully connected neural networks and per-ray sampling strategies leads to high computational costs. Moreover, NeRF's implicit representation struggles to recover fine details from hazy scenes. In contrast, recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting achieve high-quality 3D scene reconstruction by explicitly modeling point clouds into 3D Gaussians. In this paper, we propose leveraging the explicit Gaussian representation to explain the foggy image formation process through a physically accurate forward rendering process. We introduce DehazeGS, a method capable of decomposing and rendering a fog-free background from participating media using only muti-view foggy images as input. We model the transmission within each Gaussian distribution to simulate the formation of fog. During this process, we jointly learn the atmospheric light and scattering coefficient while optimizing the Gaussian representation of the hazy scene. In the inference stage, we eliminate the effects of scattering and attenuation on the Gaussians and directly project them onto a 2D plane to obtain a clear view. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world foggy datasets demonstrate that DehazeGS achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both rendering quality and computational efficiency. visualizations are available at https://dehazegs.github.io/</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages,4 figures. visualizations are available at https://dehazegs.github.io/</p></details> |

We propose a semantic regularization technique, using features extracted from the pretrained DINO-ViT model, to ensure multi-view semantic consistency. Additionally, we propose local depth regularization, which constrains depth values to improve generalization on unseen views.

Recent works have extended these approaches to support surface reconstruction and tracking. However, tracking dynamic surfaces with 3D Gaussians remains challenging due to complex topology changes, such as surfaces appearing, disappearing, or splitting. To address these challenges, we propose GSTAR, a novel method that achieves photo-realistic rendering, accurate surface reconstruction, and reliable 3D tracking for general dynamic scenes with changing topology. Given multi-view captures as input, GSTAR binds Gaussians to mesh faces to represent dynamic objects. For surfaces with consistent topology, GSTAR maintains the mesh topology and tracks the meshes using Gaussians. In regions where topology changes, GSTAR adaptively unbinds Gaussians from the mesh, enabling accurate registration and the generation of new surfaces based on these optimized Gaussians. Additionally, we introduce a surface-based scene flow method that provides robust initialization for tracking between frames. Experiments demonstrate that our method effectively tracks and reconstructs dynamic surfaces, enabling a range of applications.

| **[RDG-GS: Relative Depth Guidance with Gaussian Splatting for Real-time Sparse-View 3D Rendering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11102v1)** | 2025-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficiently synthesizing novel views from sparse inputs while maintaining accuracy remains a critical challenge in 3D reconstruction. While advanced techniques like radiance fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting achieve rendering quality and impressive efficiency with dense view inputs, they suffer from significant geometric reconstruction errors when applied to sparse input views. Moreover, although recent methods leverage monocular depth estimation to enhance geometric learning, their dependence on single-view estimated depth often leads to view inconsistency issues across different viewpoints. Consequently, this reliance on absolute depth can introduce inaccuracies in geometric information, ultimately compromising the quality of scene reconstruction with Gaussian splats. In this paper, we present RDG-GS, a novel sparse-view 3D rendering framework with Relative Depth Guidance based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. The core innovation lies in utilizing relative depth guidance to refine the Gaussian field, steering it towards view-consistent spatial geometric representations, thereby enabling the reconstruction of accurate geometric structures and capturing intricate textures. First, we devise refined depth priors to rectify the coarse estimated depth and insert global and fine-grained scene information to regular Gaussians. Building on this, to address spatial geometric inaccuracies from absolute depth, we propose relative depth guidance by optimizing the similarity between spatially correlated patches of depth and images. Additionally, we also directly deal with the sparse areas challenging to converge by the adaptive sampling for quick densification. Across extensive experiments on Mip-NeRF360, LLFF, DTU, and Blender, RDG-GS demonstrates state-of-the-art rendering quality and efficiency, making a significant advancement for real-world application.</p></details> | 24 pages, 12 figures |

However, the 3D Gaussians learned by 3D-GS have ambiguous structures without any geometry constraints. This inherent issue in 3D-GS leads to a rough boundary when segmenting individual objects. To remedy these problems, we propose SAGD, a conceptually simple yet effective boundary-enhanced segmentation pipeline for 3D-GS to improve segmentation accuracy while preserving segmentation speed. Specifically, we introduce a Gaussian Decomposition scheme, which ingeniously utilizes the special structure of 3D Gaussian, finds out, and then decomposes the boundary Gaussians. Moreover, to achieve fast interactive 3D segmentation, we introduce a novel training-free pipeline by lifting a 2D foundation model to 3D-GS. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves high-quality 3D segmentation without rough boundary issues, which can be easily applied to other scene editing tasks.</p></details> |  |

Our approach estimates 3D object-level changes by comparing two sets of unaligned images taken at different times. Leveraging 3DGS's novel view rendering and EfficientSAM's zero-shot segmentation capabilities, we detect 2D object-level changes, which are then associated and fused across views to estimate 3D change masks and object transformations. Our method can accurately identify changes in cluttered environments using sparse (as few as one) post-change images within as little as 18s. It does not rely on depth input, user instructions, pre-defined object classes, or object models -- An object is recognized simply if it has been re-arranged. Our approach is evaluated on both public and self-collected real-world datasets, achieving up to 14% higher accuracy and three orders of magnitude faster performance compared to the state-of-the-art radiance-field-based change detection method. This significant performance boost enables a broad range of downstream applications, where we highlight three key use cases: object reconstruction, robot workspace reset, and 3DGS model update.

To enhance scene reconstruction efficiency and ensure robot safety, we propose the Risk-aware Environment Masking (RaEM) framework. RaEM leverages coherent risk measures to dynamically prioritize safety-critical regions of the unknown environment, guiding active view acquisition algorithms toward identifying the next-best-view (NBV). Integrated with FisherRF, which selects the NBV by maximizing expected information gain, our framework achieves a dual objective: improving robot safety and increasing efficiency in risk-aware 3D scene reconstruction and understanding. Extensive high-fidelity experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating its ability to establish a robust and safety-focused framework for active robot exploration and 3D scene understanding.</p></details> |  |

This nonetheless arises while describing general concepts, e.g. all traffic lights in a city. To facilitate reasoning based on such concepts, text localization in the form of distribution is required. In this paper, we generate the distribution of the camera poses conditioned upon the textual description. To facilitate such generation, we propose a diffusion-based architecture that conditionally diffuses the noisy 6DoF camera poses to their plausible locations. The conditional signals are derived from the text descriptions, using the pre-trained text encoders. The connection between text descriptions and pose distribution is established through pretrained Vision-Language-Model, i.e. CLIP. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the candidate poses for the distribution can be further refined by rendering potential poses using 3D Gaussian splatting, guiding incorrectly posed samples towards locations that better align with the textual description, through visual reasoning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by comparing it with both standard retrieval methods and learning-based approaches. Our proposed method consistently outperforms these baselines across all five large-scale datasets. Our source code and dataset will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |

Many current 3D scene generation methods rely on pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models and monocular depth estimators. However, the generated scenes occupy large amounts of storage space and often lack effective regularisation methods, leading to geometric distortions. To this end, we propose BloomScene, a lightweight structured 3D Gaussian splatting for crossmodal scene generation, which creates diverse and high-quality 3D scenes from text or image inputs. Specifically, a crossmodal progressive scene generation framework is proposed to generate coherent scenes utilizing incremental point cloud reconstruction and 3D Gaussian splatting. Additionally, we propose a hierarchical depth prior-based regularization mechanism that utilizes multi-level constraints on depth accuracy and smoothness to enhance the realism and continuity of the generated scenes. Ultimately, we propose a structured context-guided compression mechanism that exploits structured hash grids to model the context of unorganized anchor attributes, which significantly eliminates structural redundancy and reduces storage overhead. Comprehensive experiments across multiple scenes demonstrate the significant potential and advantages of our framework compared with several baselines.</p></details> |  |

However, existing vision-only 3D-GS methods often rely on hand-crafted heuristics for point-cloud densification and face challenges in handling occlusions and high GPU memory and computation consumption. LiDAR-Inertial-Visual (LIV) sensor configuration has demonstrated superior performance in localization and dense mapping by leveraging complementary sensing characteristics: rich texture information from cameras, precise geometric measurements from LiDAR, and high-frequency motion data from IMU. Inspired by this, we propose a novel real-time Gaussian-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) system. Our map system comprises a global Gaussian map and a sliding window of Gaussians, along with an IESKF-based odometry. The global Gaussian map consists of hash-indexed voxels organized in a recursive octree, effectively covering sparse spatial volumes while adapting to different levels of detail and scales. The Gaussian map is initialized through multi-sensor fusion and optimized with photometric gradients. Our system incrementally maintains a sliding window of Gaussians, significantly reducing GPU computation and memory consumption by only optimizing the map within the sliding window. Moreover, we implement a tightly coupled multi-sensor fusion odometry with an iterative error state Kalman filter (IESKF), leveraging real-time updating and rendering of the Gaussian map. Our system represents the first real-time Gaussian-based SLAM framework deployable on resource-constrained embedded systems, demonstrated on the NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX platform. The framework achieves real-time performance while maintaining robust multi-sensor fusion capabilities. All implementation algorithms, hardware designs, and CAD models will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |

While differentiable rendering techniques such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) address some of these challenges, their high computational costs make them unsuitable for real-time applications. Additionally, existing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods often focus on photometric consistency, neglecting geometric accuracy and failing to exploit SLAM's dynamic depth and pose updates for scene refinement. We propose a framework integrating dense SLAM with 3DGS for real-time, high-fidelity dense reconstruction. Our approach introduces SLAM-Informed Adaptive Densification, which dynamically updates and densifies the Gaussian model by leveraging dense point clouds from SLAM. Additionally, we incorporate Geometry-Guided Optimization, which combines edge-aware geometric constraints and photometric consistency to jointly optimize the appearance and geometry of the 3DGS scene representation, enabling detailed and accurate SLAM mapping reconstruction. Experiments on the Replica and TUM-RGBD datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art results among monocular systems. Specifically, our method achieves a PSNR of 36.864, SSIM of 0.985, and LPIPS of 0.040 on Replica, representing improvements of 10.7%, 6.4%, and 49.4%, respectively, over the previous SOTA. On TUM-RGBD, our method outperforms the closest baseline by 10.2%, 6.6%, and 34.7% in the same metrics. These results highlight the potential of our framework in bridging the gap between photometric and geometric dense 3D scene representations, paving the way for practical and efficient monocular dense reconstruction.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods, such as empirical models and ray tracing, often fall short, either due to insufficient details or because of challenges for real-time applications. Inspired by the newly proposed 3D Gaussian Splatting method in the computer vision domain, which outperforms other methods in reconstructing optical radiance fields, we propose RF-3DGS, a novel approach that enables precise site-specific reconstruction of radio radiance fields from sparse samples. RF-3DGS can render radio spatial spectra at arbitrary positions within 2 ms following a brief 3-minute training period, effectively identifying dominant propagation paths. Furthermore, RF-3DGS can provide fine-grained Spatial Channel State Information (Spatial-CSI) of these paths, including the channel gain, the delay, the angle of arrival (AoA), and the angle of departure (AoD). Our experiments, calibrated through real-world measurements, demonstrate that RF-3DGS not only significantly improves reconstruction quality, training efficiency, and rendering speed compared to state-of-the-art methods, but also holds great potential for supporting wireless communication and advanced applications such as Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC).

The regularizing normal supervision facilitates better rendering and mesh reconstruction, which is crucial for downstream applications in video generation, animation, AR-VR and gaming.

Similar to analogous datasets, uCO3D contains annotations for 3D camera poses, depth maps and sparse point clouds. In addition, each object is equipped with a caption and a 3D Gaussian Splat reconstruction.

To achieve that, we extend such a model for diverse-view human head generation by fine-tuning on synthetic data and modifying its conditioning. Our avatars maintain a dense correspondence with a human face mesh template, allowing blendshape-based expression generation. This is achieved through a modified 3DGS approach, connectivity regularizers, and a strategic initialization tailored for our task. Additionally, we propose an optional efficient SDS-based correction step to refine the blendshape expressions, enhancing realism and diversity. Experiments demonstrate that Arc2Avatar achieves state-of-the-art realism and identity preservation, effectively addressing color issues by allowing the use of very low guidance, enabled by our strong identity prior and initialization strategy, without compromising detail.

In contrast, point clouds are a widely used 3D representation and are compatible with most popular 3D processing software, yet converting 3DGS scenes into point clouds is a complex challenge. In this work we introduce 3DGS-to-PC, a flexible and highly customisable framework that is capable of transforming 3DGS scenes into dense, high-accuracy point clouds. We sample points probabilistically from each Gaussian as a 3D density function. We additionally threshold new points using the Mahalanobis distance to the Gaussian centre, preventing extreme outliers. The result is a point cloud that closely represents the shape encoded into the 3D Gaussian scene. Individual Gaussians use spherical harmonics to adapt colours depending on view, and each point may contribute only subtle colour hints to the resulting rendered scene. To avoid spurious or incorrect colours that do not fit with the final point cloud, we recalculate Gaussian colours via a customised image rendering approach, assigning each Gaussian the colour of the pixel to which it contributes most across all views. 3DGS-to-PC also supports mesh generation through Poisson Surface Reconstruction, applied to points sampled from predicted surface Gaussians. This allows coloured meshes to be generated from 3DGS scenes without the need for re-training. This package is highly customisable and capability of simple integration into existing 3DGS pipelines. 3DGS-to-PC provides a powerful tool for converting 3DGS data into point cloud and surface-based formats.</p></details> |  |
| **[Synthetic Prior for Few-Shot Drivable Head Avatar Inversion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06903v1)** | 2025-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present SynShot, a novel method for the few-shot inversion of a drivable head avatar based on a synthetic prior. We tackle two major challenges. First, training a controllable 3D generative network requires a large number of diverse sequences, for which pairs of images and high-quality tracked meshes are not always available. Second, state-of-the-art monocular avatar models struggle to generalize to new views and expressions, lacking a strong prior and often overfitting to a specific viewpoint distribution. Inspired by machine learning models trained solely on synthetic data, we propose a method that learns a prior model from a large dataset of synthetic heads with diverse identities, expressions, and viewpoints. With few input images, SynShot fine-tunes the pretrained synthetic prior to bridge the domain gap, modeling a photorealistic head avatar that generalizes to novel expressions and viewpoints. We model the head avatar using 3D Gaussian splatting and a convolutional encoder-decoder that outputs Gaussian parameters in UV texture space. To account for the different modeling complexities over parts of the head (e.g., skin vs hair), we embed the prior with explicit control for upsampling the number of per-part primitives. Compared to state-of-the-art monocular methods that require thousands of real training images, SynShot significantly improves novel view and expression synthesis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website https://zielon.github.io/synshot/</p></details> |

Unlike traditional NeRF-based methods, which are computationally demanding and restrict active mapping performance, our approach leverages the efficient rendering capabilities of 3DGS, allowing effective and efficient exploration in complex environments. The core of our system is a rendering-based information gain module that dynamically identifies the most informative viewpoints for next-best-view planning, enhancing both geometric and photometric reconstruction accuracy. ActiveGAMER also integrates a carefully balanced framework, combining coarse-to-fine exploration, post-refinement, and a global-local keyframe selection strategy to maximize reconstruction completeness and fidelity. Our system autonomously explores and reconstructs environments with state-of-the-art geometric and photometric accuracy and completeness, significantly surpassing existing approaches in both aspects. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets such as Replica and MP3D highlight ActiveGAMER's effectiveness in active mapping tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, these full-reference methods, which compare synthesized views to reference views, may not fully capture the perceptual quality of neurally synthesized scenes (NSS), particularly due to the limited availability of dense reference views. Furthermore, the challenges in acquiring human perceptual labels hinder the creation of extensive labeled datasets, risking model overfitting and reduced generalizability. To address these issues, we propose NVS-SQA, a NSS quality assessment method to learn no-reference quality representations through self-supervision without reliance on human labels. Traditional self-supervised learning predominantly relies on the "same instance, similar representation" assumption and extensive datasets. However, given that these conditions do not apply in NSS quality assessment, we employ heuristic cues and quality scores as learning objectives, along with a specialized contrastive pair preparation process to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of learning. The results show that NVS-SQA outperforms 17 no-reference methods by a large margin (i.e., on average 109.5% in SRCC, 98.6% in PLCC, and 91.5% in KRCC over the second best) and even exceeds 16 full-reference methods across all evaluation metrics (i.e., 22.9% in SRCC, 19.1% in PLCC, and 18.6% in KRCC over the second best).</p></details> |  |

However, due to the unstructured and irregular nature of Gaussian point clouds, it is difficult to guarantee geometric reconstruction accuracy and multi-view consistency simply by relying on image reconstruction loss. Although many studies on surface reconstruction based on 3DGS have emerged recently, the quality of their meshes is generally unsatisfactory. To address this problem, we propose a fast planar-based Gaussian splatting reconstruction representation (PGSR) to achieve high-fidelity surface reconstruction while ensuring high-quality rendering. Specifically, we first introduce an unbiased depth rendering method, which directly renders the distance from the camera origin to the Gaussian plane and the corresponding normal map based on the Gaussian distribution of the point cloud, and divides the two to obtain the unbiased depth. We then introduce single-view geometric, multi-view photometric, and geometric regularization to preserve global geometric accuracy. We also propose a camera exposure compensation model to cope with scenes with large illumination variations. Experiments on indoor and outdoor scenes show that our method achieves fast training and rendering while maintaining high-fidelity rendering and geometric reconstruction, outperforming 3DGS-based and NeRF-based methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://zju3dv.github.io/pgsr/</p></details> |

To this end, we first analyze the local coherence of 3D Gaussian attributes, and propose a novel locality-aware 3D Gaussian representation that effectively encodes locally-coherent Gaussian attributes using a neural field representation with a minimal storage requirement. On top of the novel representation, LocoGS is carefully designed with additional components such as dense initialization, an adaptive spherical harmonics bandwidth scheme and different encoding schemes for different Gaussian attributes to maximize compression performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the rendering quality of existing compact Gaussian representations for representative real-world 3D datasets while achieving from 54.6$\times$ to 96.6$\times$ compressed storage size and from 2.1$\times$ to 2.4$\times$ rendering speed than 3DGS.

However, existing SLAM methods utilizing 3DGS have failed to provide high-quality novel view rendering for monocular, stereo, and RGB-D cameras simultaneously. Notably, some methods perform well for RGB-D cameras but suffer significant degradation in rendering quality for monocular cameras. In this paper, we present Scaffold-SLAM, which delivers simultaneous localization and high-quality photorealistic mapping across monocular, stereo, and RGB-D cameras. We introduce two key innovations to achieve this state-of-the-art visual quality. First, we propose Appearance-from-Motion embedding, enabling 3D Gaussians to better model image appearance variations across different camera poses. Second, we introduce a frequency regularization pyramid to guide the distribution of Gaussians, allowing the model to effectively capture finer details in the scene. Extensive experiments on monocular, stereo, and RGB-D datasets demonstrate that Scaffold-SLAM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in photorealistic mapping quality, e.g., PSNR is 16.76% higher in the TUM RGB-D datasets for monocular cameras.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |

Yet, existing methods often face challenges related to high memory usage, lengthy training times, and temporal consistency. To address these issues, we introduce a novel neural video representation that combines 3D Gaussian splatting with continuous camera motion modeling. By leveraging Neural ODEs, our approach learns smooth camera trajectories while maintaining an explicit 3D scene representation through Gaussians. Additionally, we introduce a spatiotemporal hierarchical learning strategy, progressively refining spatial and temporal features to enhance reconstruction quality and accelerate convergence. This memory-efficient approach achieves high-quality rendering at impressive speeds. Experimental results show that our hierarchical learning, combined with robust camera motion modeling, captures complex dynamic scenes with strong temporal consistency, achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse video datasets in both high- and low-motion scenarios.</p></details> | 10 pages, 10 figures |

However, training a 3DGS model remains a time-intensive task, especially in load imbalance scenarios where workload diversity among pixels and Gaussian spheres causes poor renderCUDA kernel performance. We introduce Balanced 3DGS, a Gaussian-wise parallelism rendering with fine-grained tiling approach in 3DGS training process, perfectly solving load-imbalance issues. First, we innovatively introduce the inter-block dynamic workload distribution technique to map workloads to Streaming Multiprocessor(SM) resources within a single GPU dynamically, which constitutes the foundation of load balancing. Second, we are the first to propose the Gaussian-wise parallel rendering technique to significantly reduce workload divergence inside a warp, which serves as a critical component in addressing load imbalance. Based on the above two methods, we further creatively put forward the fine-grained combined load balancing technique to uniformly distribute workload across all SMs, which boosts the forward renderCUDA kernel performance by up to 7.52x. Besides, we present a self-adaptive render kernel selection strategy during the 3DGS training process based on different load-balance situations, which effectively improves training efficiency.</p></details> |  |

Despite delivering remarkable rendering quality and speed, existing methods struggle with storage demands and representing complex real-world motions. To tackle these issues, we propose MoDecGS, a memory-efficient Gaussian splatting framework designed for reconstructing novel views in challenging scenarios with complex motions. We introduce GlobaltoLocal Motion Decomposition (GLMD) to effectively capture dynamic motions in a coarsetofine manner. This approach leverages Global Canonical Scaffolds (Global CS) and Local Canonical Scaffolds (Local CS), extending static Scaffold representation to dynamic video reconstruction. For Global CS, we propose Global Anchor Deformation (GAD) to efficiently represent global dynamics along complex motions, by directly deforming the implicit Scaffold attributes which are anchor position, offset, and local context features. Next, we finely adjust local motions via the Local Gaussian Deformation (LGD) of Local CS explicitly. Additionally, we introduce Temporal Interval Adjustment (TIA) to automatically control the temporal coverage of each Local CS during training, allowing MoDecGS to find optimal interval assignments based on the specified number of temporal segments. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that MoDecGS achieves an average 70% reduction in model size over stateoftheart methods for dynamic 3D Gaussians from realworld dynamic videos while maintaining or even improving rendering quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>The l...</summary><p>The last two authors are co-corresponding authors.

While traditional visual data (such as images and videos) and NeRF-based formats already have mature techniques for copyright protection, steganographic techniques for the emerging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) format have yet to be fully explored. To address this, we propose ConcealGS, an innovative method for embedding implicit information into 3D-GS. By introducing the knowledge distillation and gradient optimization strategy based on 3D-GS, ConcealGS overcomes the limitations of NeRF-based models and enhances the robustness of implicit information and the quality of 3D reconstruction. We evaluate ConcealGS in various potential application scenarios, and experimental results have demonstrated that ConcealGS not only successfully recovers implicit information but also has almost no impact on rendering quality, providing a new approach for embedding invisible and recoverable information into 3D models in the future.</p></details> |  |

However, its substantial data requirements present challenges for practical applications. In this paper, we introduce an efficient compression technique that significantly reduces storage overhead by using compact representation. We propose a unified architecture that combines point cloud data and feature planes through a progressive tri-plane structure. Our method utilizes 2D feature planes, enabling continuous spatial representation. To further optimize these representations, we incorporate entropy modeling in the frequency domain, specifically designed for standard video codecs. We also propose channel-wise bit allocation to achieve a better trade-off between bitrate consumption and feature plane representation. Consequently, our model effectively leverages spatial correlations within the feature planes to enhance rate-distortion performance using standard, non-differentiable video codecs. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in data compactness while maintaining high rendering quality.

However, due to significant occlusions between hands and object as well as the high degree-of-freedom motions, it is challenging to collect and annotate a high-quality, large-scale dataset, which prevents further improvement of bimanual hand-object interaction-related baselines. In this work, we propose a new 3D Gaussian Splatting based data augmentation framework for bimanual hand-object interaction, which is capable of augmenting existing dataset to large-scale photorealistic data with various hand-object pose and viewpoints. First, we use mesh-based 3DGS to model objects and hands, and to deal with the rendering blur problem due to multi-resolution input images used, we design a super-resolution module. Second, we extend the single hand grasping pose optimization module for the bimanual hand object to generate various poses of bimanual hand-object interaction, which can significantly expand the pose distribution of the dataset. Third, we conduct an analysis for the impact of different aspects of the proposed data augmentation on the understanding of the bimanual hand-object interaction.

However, in trained scenes, a large number of Gaussians with low opacity significantly increase rendering costs. This issue arises due to flaws in the split and clone operations during the densification process, which lead to extensive Gaussian overlap and subsequent opacity reduction. To enhance the efficiency of Gaussian utilization, we improve the adaptive density control of 3DGS. First, we introduce a more efficient long-axis split operation to replace the original clone and split, which mitigates Gaussian overlap and improves densification efficiency.Second, we propose a simple adaptive pruning technique to reduce the number of low-opacity Gaussians. Finally, by dynamically lowering the splitting threshold and applying importance weighting, the efficiency of Gaussian utilization is further improved. We evaluate our proposed method on various challenging real-world datasets. Experimental results show that our Efficient Density Control (EDC) can enhance both the rendering speed and quality.

While existing 3DGS methods perform well in scenes with minor view variation, large view changes in cross-view scenes pose optimization challenges for these methods. To address these issues, we propose a novel cross-view Gaussian Splatting method for large-scale scene reconstruction, based on dual-branch fusion. Our method independently reconstructs models from aerial and ground views as two independent branches to establish the baselines of Gaussian distribution, providing reliable priors for cross-view reconstruction during both initialization and densification. Specifically, a gradient-aware regularization strategy is introduced to mitigate smoothing issues caused by significant view disparities. Additionally, a unique Gaussian supplementation strategy is utilized to incorporate complementary information of dual-branch into the cross-view model. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance in novel view synthesis compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Based on 3DGS, recent advancements cope with large-scale scenes via spatial-based partition strategy to reduce video memory and optimization time costs. In this work, we introduce a parallel Gaussian splatting method, termed PG-SAG, which fully exploits semantic cues for both partitioning and Gaussian kernel optimization, enabling fine-grained building surface reconstruction of large-scale urban areas without downsampling the original image resolution. First, the Cross-modal model - Language Segment Anything is leveraged to segment building masks. Then, the segmented building regions is grouped into sub-regions according to the visibility check across registered images. The Gaussian kernels for these sub-regions are optimized in parallel with masked pixels. In addition, the normal loss is re-formulated for the detected edges of masks to alleviate the ambiguities in normal vectors on edges. Finally, to improve the optimization of 3D Gaussians, we introduce a gradient-constrained balance-load loss that accounts for the complexity of the corresponding scenes, effectively minimizing the thread waiting time in the pixel-parallel rendering stage as well as the reconstruction lost. Extensive experiments are tested on various urban datasets, the results demonstrated the superior performance of our PG-SAG on building surface reconstruction, compared to several state-of-the-art 3DGS-based methods.

Building on recent advancements in 3D Gaussian splatting, current methods have seen significant improvements in both reconstruction quality and rendering speed. However, two major limitations remain: (1) difficulty in handling irreversible dynamic changes, such as tissue shearing, which are common in surgical scenes; and (2) the lack of hierarchical modeling for surgical scene deformation, which reduces rendering speed. To address these challenges, we introduce EH-SurGS, an efficient and high-fidelity reconstruction algorithm for deformable surgical scenes. We propose a deformation modeling approach that incorporates the life cycle of 3D Gaussians, effectively capturing both regular and irreversible deformations, thus enhancing reconstruction quality. Additionally, we present an adaptive motion hierarchy strategy that distinguishes between static and deformable regions within the surgical scene. This strategy reduces the number of 3D Gaussians passing through the deformation field, thereby improving rendering speed. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses existing state-of-the-art approaches in both reconstruction quality and rendering speed. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness and necessity of our proposed components.

Despite their impressive performance, they confront challenges due to the limitation of structure-from-motion (SfM) methods on acquiring accurate scene initialization, or the inefficiency of densification strategy. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework EasySplat to achieve high-quality 3DGS modeling. Instead of using SfM for scene initialization, we employ a novel method to release the power of large-scale pointmap approaches. Specifically, we propose an efficient grouping strategy based on view similarity, and use robust pointmap priors to obtain high-quality point clouds and camera poses for 3D scene initialization. After obtaining a reliable scene structure, we propose a novel densification approach that adaptively splits Gaussian primitives based on the average shape of neighboring Gaussian ellipsoids, utilizing KNN scheme. In this way, the proposed method tackles the limitation on initialization and optimization, leading to an efficient and accurate 3DGS modeling.

However, existing Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) methods generally focus on either geometric or semantic reconstruction. In this paper, we introduce PanoSLAM, the first SLAM system to integrate geometric reconstruction, 3D semantic segmentation, and 3D instance segmentation within a unified framework. Our approach builds upon 3D Gaussian Splatting, modified with several critical components to enable efficient rendering of depth, color, semantic, and instance information from arbitrary viewpoints. To achieve panoptic 3D scene reconstruction from sequential RGB-D videos, we propose an online Spatial-Temporal Lifting (STL) module that transfers 2D panoptic predictions from vision models into 3D Gaussian representations. This STL module addresses the challenges of label noise and inconsistencies in 2D predictions by refining the pseudo labels across multi-view inputs, creating a coherent 3D representation that enhances segmentation accuracy. Our experiments show that PanoSLAM outperforms recent semantic SLAM methods in both mapping and tracking accuracy.

However, reliance on third-degree spherical harmonics for color representation introduces significant storage demands and computational overhead, resulting in a large memory footprint and slower rendering speed. We introduce SG-Splatting with Spherical Gaussians based color representation, a novel approach to enhance rendering speed and quality in novel view synthesis. Our method first represents view-dependent color using Spherical Gaussians, instead of three degree spherical harmonics, which largely reduces the number of parameters used for color representation, and significantly accelerates the rendering process. We then develop an efficient strategy for organizing multiple Spherical Gaussians, optimizing their arrangement to achieve a balanced and accurate scene representation. To further improve rendering quality, we propose a mixed representation that combines Spherical Gaussians with low-degree spherical harmonics, capturing both high- and low-frequency color information effectively. SG-Splatting also has plug-and-play capability, allowing it to be easily integrated into existing systems. This approach improves computational efficiency and overall visual fidelity, making it a practical solution for real-time applications.</p></details> |  |

Our avatar model enables facial attribute editing in a continuous and disentangled latent space to control each facial attribute, while preserving the individual's identity. To achieve this, our method begins by synthesizing large-scale synthetic 2D video datasets, where each video contains consistent changes in the facial expression and viewpoint, combined with a variation in a specific facial attribute from the original input. We propose a novel pipeline to produce high-quality, photorealistic 2D videos with facial attribute editing. Leveraging this synthetic attribute dataset, we present a personalized avatar creation method based on the 3D Gaussian Splatting, learning a continuous and disentangled latent space for intuitive facial attribute manipulation. To enforce smooth transitions in this latent space, we introduce a latent space regularization technique by using interpolated 2D faces as supervision. Compared to previous approaches, we demonstrate that PERSE generates high-quality avatars with interpolated attributes while preserving identity of reference person.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://hyunsoocha.github.io/perse/</p></details> |

Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has gained prominence due to its explicit representation with efficient training speed and real-time rendering capabilities. However, existing methods still heavily depend on accurate camera poses for reconstruction. Although some recent approaches attempt to train 3DGS models without the Structure-from-Motion (SfM) preprocessing from monocular video datasets, these methods suffer from prolonged training times, making them impractical for many applications. In this paper, we present an efficient framework that operates without any depth or matching model. Our approach initially uses SfM to quickly obtain rough camera poses within seconds, and then refines these poses by leveraging the dense representation in 3DGS. This framework effectively addresses the issue of long training times. Additionally, we integrate the densification process with joint refinement and propose a coarse-to-fine frequency-aware densification to reconstruct different levels of details. This approach prevents camera pose estimation from being trapped in local minima or drifting due to high-frequency signals. Our method significantly reduces training time from hours to minutes while achieving more accurate novel view synthesis and camera pose estimation compared to previous methods.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 |
| **[WeatherGS: 3D Scene Reconstruction in Adverse Weather Conditions via Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18862v2)** | 2024-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has gained significant attention for 3D scene reconstruction, but still suffers from complex outdoor environments, especially under adverse weather. This is because 3DGS treats the artifacts caused by adverse weather as part of the scene and will directly reconstruct them, largely reducing the clarity of the reconstructed scene. To address this challenge, we propose WeatherGS, a 3DGS-based framework for reconstructing clear scenes from multi-view images under different weather conditions. Specifically, we explicitly categorize the multi-weather artifacts into the dense particles and lens occlusions that have very different characters, in which the former are caused by snowflakes and raindrops in the air, and the latter are raised by the precipitation on the camera lens. In light of this, we propose a dense-to-sparse preprocess strategy, which sequentially removes the dense particles by an Atmospheric Effect Filter (AEF) and then extracts the relatively sparse occlusion masks with a Lens Effect Detector (LED). Finally, we train a set of 3D Gaussians by the processed images and generated masks for excluding occluded areas, and accurately recover the underlying clear scene by Gaussian splatting. We conduct a diverse and challenging benchmark to facilitate the evaluation of 3D reconstruction under complex weather scenarios. Extensive experiments on this benchmark demonstrate that our WeatherGS consistently produces high-quality, clean scenes across various weather scenarios, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.

| **[MaskGaussian: Adaptive 3D Gaussian Representation from Probabilistic Masks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20522v1)** | 2024-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable performance in novel view synthesis and real-time rendering, the high memory consumption due to the use of millions of Gaussians limits its practicality. To mitigate this issue, improvements have been made by pruning unnecessary Gaussians, either through a hand-crafted criterion or by using learned masks. However, these methods deterministically remove Gaussians based on a snapshot of the pruning moment, leading to sub-optimized reconstruction performance from a long-term perspective. To address this issue, we introduce MaskGaussian, which models Gaussians as probabilistic entities rather than permanently removing them, and utilize them according to their probability of existence. To achieve this, we propose a masked-rasterization technique that enables unused yet probabilistically existing Gaussians to receive gradients, allowing for dynamic assessment of their contribution to the evolving scene and adjustment of their probability of existence. Hence, the importance of Gaussians iteratively changes and the pruned Gaussians are selected diversely. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in achieving better rendering quality with fewer Gaussians than previous pruning methods, pruning over 60% of Gaussians on average with only a 0.02 PSNR decline.

To tackle these challenges in existing methods, we propose a decomposed per-embedding Gaussian fields (DEGSTalk), a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based talking face synthesis method for generating realistic talking faces with long hairs. Our DEGSTalk employs Deformable Pre-Embedding Gaussian Fields, which dynamically adjust pre-embedding Gaussian primitives using implicit expression coefficients. This enables precise capture of dynamic facial regions and subtle expressions. Additionally, we propose a Dynamic Hair-Preserving Portrait Rendering technique to enhance the realism of long hair motions in the synthesized videos.

| **[Dust to Tower: Coarse-to-Fine Photo-Realistic Scene Reconstruction from Sparse Uncalibrated Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19518v1)** | 2024-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photo-realistic scene reconstruction from sparse-view, uncalibrated images is highly required in practice. Although some successes have been made, existing methods are either Sparse-View but require accurate camera parameters (i.e., intrinsic and extrinsic), or SfM-free but need densely captured images. To combine the advantages of both methods while addressing their respective weaknesses, we propose Dust to Tower (D2T), an accurate and efficient coarse-to-fine framework to optimize 3DGS and image poses simultaneously from sparse and uncalibrated images. Our key idea is to first construct a coarse model efficiently and subsequently refine it using warped and inpainted images at novel viewpoints. To do this, we first introduce a Coarse Construction Module (CCM) which exploits a fast Multi-View Stereo model to initialize a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and recover initial camera poses. To refine the 3D model at novel viewpoints, we propose a Confidence Aware Depth Alignment (CADA) module to refine the coarse depth maps by aligning their confident parts with estimated depths by a Mono-depth model. Then, a Warped Image-Guided Inpainting (WIGI) module is proposed to warp the training images to novel viewpoints by the refined depth maps, and inpainting is applied to fulfill the ``holes" in the warped images caused by view-direction changes, providing high-quality supervision to further optimize the 3D model and the camera poses. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the validity of D2T and its design choices, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both tasks of novel view synthesis and pose estimation while keeping high efficiency. Codes will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |

SCI is a cost-effective method that enables the recording of high-dimensional data, such as hyperspectral or temporal information, into a single image using low-cost 2D imaging sensors. To achieve this, a series of specially designed 2D masks are usually employed, reducing storage and transmission requirements and offering potential privacy protection. Inspired by this, we take one step further to recover the encoded 3D scene information leveraging powerful 3D scene representation capabilities of neural radiance fields (NeRF). Specifically, we propose SCINeRF, in which we formulate the physical imaging process of SCI as part of the training of NeRF, allowing us to exploit its impressive performance in capturing complex scene structures. In addition, we further integrate the popular 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) framework and propose SCISplat to improve 3D scene reconstruction quality and training/rendering speed by explicitly optimizing point clouds into 3D Gaussian representations. To assess the effectiveness of our method, we conduct extensive evaluations using both synthetic data and real data captured by our SCI system. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach surpasses the state-of-the-art methods in terms of image reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Moreover, our method also exhibits the ability to render high frame-rate multi-view consistent images in real time by leveraging SCI and the rendering capabilities of 3DGS.

| **[Generating Editable Head Avatars with 3D Gaussian GANs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19149v1)** | 2024-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating animatable and editable 3D head avatars is essential for various applications in computer vision and graphics. Traditional 3D-aware generative adversarial networks (GANs), often using implicit fields like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), achieve photorealistic and view-consistent 3D head synthesis. However, these methods face limitations in deformation flexibility and editability, hindering the creation of lifelike and easily modifiable 3D heads. We propose a novel approach that enhances the editability and animation control of 3D head avatars by incorporating 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) as an explicit 3D representation. This method enables easier illumination control and improved editability. Central to our approach is the Editable Gaussian Head (EG-Head) model, which combines a 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) with texture maps, allowing precise expression control and flexible texture editing for accurate animation while preserving identity. To capture complex non-facial geometries like hair, we use an auxiliary set of 3DGS and tri-plane features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach delivers high-quality 3D-aware synthesis with state-of-the-art controllability.

However, typically 3D multimodal models are only capable of handling point clouds. Compared to the emerging 3D representation technique, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), the spatially sparse point cloud cannot depict the texture information of 3D objects, resulting in inferior reconstruction capabilities. This limitation constrains the potential of point cloud-based 3D multimodal representation learning. In this paper, we present CLIP-GS, a novel multimodal representation learning framework grounded in 3DGS. We introduce the GS Tokenizer to generate serialized gaussian tokens, which are then processed through transformer layers pre-initialized with weights from point cloud models, resulting in the 3DGS embeddings. CLIP-GS leverages contrastive loss between 3DGS and the visual-text embeddings of CLIP, and we introduce an image voting loss to guide the directionality and convergence of gradient optimization. Furthermore, we develop an efficient way to generate triplets of 3DGS, images, and text, facilitating CLIP-GS in learning unified multimodal representations. Leveraging the well-aligned multimodal representations, CLIP-GS demonstrates versatility and outperforms point cloud-based models on various 3D tasks, including multimodal retrieval, zero-shot, and few-shot classification.</p></details> |  |

Previous research has tackled this issue by incorporating Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) or 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) as scene representations within dense SLAM methods. However, most studies focus primarily on estimating coarse 3D scenes rather than achieving detailed reconstructions. Moreover, depth estimation based solely on images is often ambiguous, resulting in low-quality 3D models that lead to inaccurate renderings. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework for high-quality 3DGS modeling that leverages an online multi-view stereo (MVS) approach. Our method estimates MVS depth using sequential frames from a local time window and applies comprehensive depth refinement techniques to filter out outliers, enabling accurate initialization of Gaussians in 3DGS. Furthermore, we introduce a parallelized backend module that optimizes the 3DGS model efficiently, ensuring timely updates with each new keyframe. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art dense SLAM methods, particularly excelling in challenging outdoor environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 6 figures, submitted to IEEE ICRA 2025</p></details> |

It leverages unique parametrization to mitigate computational demands in scene optimization. This work introduces Topology-Aware 3D Gaussian Splatting (Topology-GS), which addresses two key limitations in current approaches: compromised pixel-level structural integrity due to incomplete initial geometric coverage, and inadequate feature-level integrity from insufficient topological constraints during optimization. To overcome these limitations, Topology-GS incorporates a novel interpolation strategy, Local Persistent Voronoi Interpolation (LPVI), and a topology-focused regularization term based on persistent barcodes, named PersLoss. LPVI utilizes persistent homology to guide adaptive interpolation, enhancing point coverage in low-curvature areas while preserving topological structure. PersLoss aligns the visual perceptual similarity of rendered images with ground truth by constraining distances between their topological features. Comprehensive experiments on three novel-view synthesis benchmarks demonstrate that Topology-GS outperforms existing methods in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS metrics, while maintaining efficient memory usage. This study pioneers the integration of topology with 3D-GS, laying the groundwork for future research in this area.</p></details> |  |

While this level of customization proves beneficial when creating virtual urban environments, this process becomes cumbersome when intending to train within a digital twin or a duplicate of a real scene. Gaussian splatting emerged as a powerful technique in scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis, boasting high fidelity and rendering speeds. In this paper, we introduce GSAVS, an autonomous vehicle simulator that supports the creation and development of autonomous vehicle models. Every asset within the simulator is a 3D Gaussian splat, including the vehicles and the environment. However, the simulator runs within a classical 3D engine, rendering 3D Gaussian splats in real-time. This allows the simulator to utilize the photorealism that 3D Gaussian splatting boasts while providing the customization and ease of use of a classical 3D engine.</p></details> |  |

However, recent methods often struggle to maintain local consistency in color and texture throughout stylized scenes, which is essential for maintaining aesthetic coherence. To solve this problem, this paper introduces ArtNVG, an innovative 3D stylization framework that efficiently generates stylized 3D scenes by leveraging reference style images. Built on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), ArtNVG achieves rapid optimization and rendering while upholding high reconstruction quality. Our framework realizes high-quality 3D stylization by incorporating two pivotal techniques: Content-Style Separated Control and Attention-based Neighboring-View Alignment. Content-Style Separated Control uses the CSGO model and the Tile ControlNet to decouple the content and style control, reducing risks of information leakage. Concurrently, Attention-based Neighboring-View Alignment ensures consistency of local colors and textures across neighboring views, significantly improving visual quality. Extensive experiments validate that ArtNVG surpasses existing methods, delivering superior results in content preservation, style alignment, and local consistency.</p></details> |  |

Additionally, the approach introduces coordinate transformations with distortion parameters for camera models to achieve pixel-level alignment between LiDAR point clouds and 2D images, facilitating heterogeneous data fusion and achieving the high-precision geo-alignment required in aerial remote sensing. Depth and plane consistency losses are incorporated into the loss function to guide Gaussians towards real depth and plane representations, significantly improving depth estimation accuracy. Experimental results indicate that our approach has achieved novel view synthesis that balances photo-realistic visual quality and high-precision geometric estimation under aerial remote sensing datasets.

While extant research has endeavored to extend the application of 3DGS from static to dynamic scenes, such efforts have been consistently impeded by excessive model sizes, constraints on video duration, and content deviation. These limitations significantly compromise the streamability of dynamic 3D Gaussian models, thereby restricting their utility in downstream applications, including volumetric video, autonomous vehicle, and immersive technologies such as virtual, augmented, and mixed reality. This paper introduces SwinGS, a novel framework for training, delivering, and rendering volumetric video in a real-time streaming fashion. To address the aforementioned challenges and enhance streamability, SwinGS integrates spacetime Gaussian with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to adapt the model to fit various 3D scenes across frames, in the meantime employing a sliding window captures Gaussian snapshots for each frame in an accumulative way. We implement a prototype of SwinGS and demonstrate its streamability across various datasets and scenes. Additionally, we develop an interactive WebGL viewer enabling real-time volumetric video playback on most devices with modern browsers, including smartphones and tablets. Experimental results show that SwinGS reduces transmission costs by 83.6% compared to previous work with ignorable compromise in PSNR. Moreover, SwinGS easily scales to long video sequences without compromising quality.</p></details> |  |

GaussianPainter introduces an innovative feed-forward approach to overcome the limitations of time-consuming test-time optimization in 3D Gaussian splatting. Our method addresses a critical challenge in the field: the non-uniqueness problem inherent in the large parameter space of 3D Gaussian splatting. This space, encompassing rotation, anisotropic scales, and spherical harmonic coefficients, introduces the challenge of rendering similar images from substantially different Gaussian fields. As a result, feed-forward networks face instability when attempting to directly predict high-quality Gaussian fields, struggling to converge on consistent parameters for a given output. To address this issue, we propose to estimate a surface normal for each point to determine its Gaussian rotation. This strategy enables the network to effectively predict the remaining Gaussian parameters in the constrained space. We further enhance our approach with an appearance injection module, incorporating reference image appearance into Gaussian fields via a multiscale triplane representation. Our method successfully balances efficiency and fidelity in 3D Gaussian generation, achieving high-quality, diverse, and robust 3D content creation from point clouds in a single forward pass.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in AAAI 2025</p></details> |

Our proposed method remains robust against distortions in rendered images and model attacks while maintaining high rendering quality. To achieve these objectives, we present Frequency-Guided Densification~(FGD), which removes 3D Gaussians based on their contribution to rendering quality, enhancing real-time rendering and the robustness of the message. FGD utilizes Discrete Fourier Transform to split 3D Gaussians in high-frequency areas, improving rendering quality.

Harnessing superior learning speed and real-time rendering capabilities, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently demonstrated considerable potential in this field. However, 3DGS can be inefficient in terms of storage and prone to overfitting by excessively growing Gaussians, particularly with limited views. This paper proposes an efficient framework, dubbed HiCoM, with three key components. First, we construct a compact and robust initial 3DGS representation using a perturbation smoothing strategy. Next, we introduce a Hierarchical Coherent Motion mechanism that leverages the inherent non-uniform distribution and local consistency of 3D Gaussians to swiftly and accurately learn motions across frames. Finally, we continually refine the 3DGS with additional Gaussians, which are later merged into the initial 3DGS to maintain consistency with the evolving scene. To preserve a compact representation, an equivalent number of low-opacity Gaussians that minimally impact the representation are removed before processing subsequent frames. Extensive experiments conducted on two widely used datasets show that our framework improves learning efficiency of the state-of-the-art methods by about $20\%$ and reduces the data storage by $85\%$, achieving competitive free-viewpoint video synthesis quality but with higher robustness and stability. Moreover, by parallel learning multiple frames simultaneously, our HiCoM decreases the average training wall time to $<2$ seconds per frame with negligible performance degradation, substantially boosting real-world applicability and responsiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2024; Code is avaliable at https://github.com/gqk/HiCoM</p></details> |

In this paper, we consider the new task of generalizable 3D semantic field modeling from sparse, uncalibrated image pairs. Building upon the Splatt3R architecture, we introduce GSemSplat, a framework that learns open-vocabulary semantic representations linked to 3D Gaussians without the need for per-scene optimization, dense image collections or calibration. To ensure effective and reliable learning of semantic features in 3D space, we employ a dual-feature approach that leverages both region-specific and context-aware semantic features as supervision in the 2D space. This allows us to capitalize on their complementary strengths. Experimental results on the ScanNet++ dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our approach compared to the traditional scene-specific method. We hope our work will inspire more research into generalizable 3D understanding.</p></details> |  |

High-quality reconstrution of 3DGS relies on sufficient splats and a reasonable distribution of these splats to fit real geometric surface and texture details, which turns out to be a challenging problem. We present GeoTexDensifier, a novel geometry-texture-aware densification strategy to reconstruct high-quality Gaussian splats which better comply with the geometric structure and texture richness of the scene. Specifically, our GeoTexDensifier framework carries out an auxiliary texture-aware densification method to produce a denser distribution of splats in fully textured areas, while keeping sparsity in low-texture regions to maintain the quality of Gaussian point cloud. Meanwhile, a geometry-aware splitting strategy takes depth and normal priors to guide the splitting sampling and filter out the noisy splats whose initial positions are far from the actual geometric surfaces they aim to fit, under a Validation of Depth Ratio Change checking. With the help of relative monocular depth prior, such geometry-aware validation can effectively reduce the influence of scattered Gaussians to the final rendering quality, especially in regions with weak textures or without sufficient training views. The texture-aware densification and geometry-aware splitting strategies are fully combined to obtain a set of high-quality Gaussian splats. We experiment our GeoTexDensifier framework on various datasets and compare our Novel View Synthesis results to other state-of-the-art 3DGS approaches, with detailed quantitative and qualitative evaluations to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in producing more photorealistic 3DGS models.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 8 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

Although omnidirectional images are getting more popular since they reduce the computation for image stitching to composite a holistic scene, existing feed-forward models are only designed for perspective images. The unique optical properties of omnidirectional images make it difficult for feature encoders to correctly understand the context of the image and make the Gaussian non-uniform in space, which hinders the image quality synthesized from novel views. We propose OmniSplat, a pioneering work for fast feed-forward 3DGS generation from a few omnidirectional images. We introduce Yin-Yang grid and decompose images based on it to reduce the domain gap between omnidirectional and perspective images. The Yin-Yang grid can use the existing CNN structure as it is, but its quasi-uniform characteristic allows the decomposed image to be similar to a perspective image, so it can exploit the strong prior knowledge of the learned feed-forward network. OmniSplat demonstrates higher reconstruction accuracy than existing feed-forward networks trained on perspective images. Furthermore, we enhance the segmentation consistency between omnidirectional images by leveraging attention from the encoder of OmniSplat, providing fast and clean 3DGS editing results.</p></details> |  |

Driving scene images from vehicle-mounted cameras are typically sparse, with limited overlap, and the movement of the vehicle further complicates the acquisition of camera extrinsics. To tackle these challenges and achieve real-time reconstruction, we jointly train a pose network, a depth network, and a Gaussian network to predict the Gaussian primitives that represent the driving scenes. The pose network and depth network determine the position of the Gaussian primitives in a self-supervised manner, without using depth ground truth and camera extrinsics during training. The Gaussian network independently predicts primitive parameters from each input image, including covariance, opacity, and spherical harmonics coefficients. At the inference stage, our model can achieve feed-forward reconstruction from flexible multi-frame surround-view input. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset show that our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art feed-forward and scene-optimized reconstruction methods in terms of reconstruction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accept by AAAI 2025.

Despite the promising results achieved with 2D diffusion priors, current methods struggle to create high-quality and consistent animated avatars efficiently. Previous animatable head models like FLAME have difficulty in accurately representing detailed texture and geometry. Additionally, high-quality 3D static representations face challenges in semantically driving with dynamic priors. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{HeadStudio}, a novel framework that utilizes 3D Gaussian splatting to generate realistic and animatable avatars from text prompts. Firstly, we associate 3D Gaussians with animatable head prior model, facilitating semantic animation on high-quality 3D representations. To ensure consistent animation, we further enhance the optimization from initialization, distillation, and regularization to jointly learn the shape, texture, and animation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of HeadStudio in generating animatable avatars from textual prompts, exhibiting appealing appearances. The avatars are capable of rendering high-quality real-time ($\geq 40$ fps) novel views at a resolution of 1024. Moreover, These avatars can be smoothly driven by real-world speech and video. We hope that HeadStudio can enhance digital avatar creation and gain popularity in the community.

While conventional methods depend on sharp images for accurate scene reconstruction, real-world scenarios are often affected by defocus blur due to finite depth of field, making it essential to account for realistic 3D scene representation. In this study, we propose CoCoGaussian, a Circle of Confusion-aware Gaussian Splatting that enables precise 3D scene representation using only defocused images. CoCoGaussian addresses the challenge of defocus blur by modeling the Circle of Confusion (CoC) through a physically grounded approach based on the principles of photographic defocus. Exploiting 3D Gaussians, we compute the CoC diameter from depth and learnable aperture information, generating multiple Gaussians to precisely capture the CoC shape. Furthermore, we introduce a learnable scaling factor to enhance robustness and provide more flexibility in handling unreliable depth in scenes with reflective or refractive surfaces. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that CoCoGaussian achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://Jho-Yonsei.github.io/CoCoGaussian/</p></details> |

Recent studies have explored signed distance fields (SDF) within Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) to achieve high-fidelity surface reconstructions. However, these approaches often suffer from slow training and rendering speeds compared to 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS). Current state-of-the-art techniques attempt to fuse depth information to extract geometry from 3DGS, but frequently result in incomplete reconstructions and fragmented surfaces. In this paper, we introduce GSurf, a novel end-to-end method for learning a signed distance field directly from Gaussian primitives. The continuous and smooth nature of SDF addresses common issues in the 3DGS family, such as holes resulting from noisy or missing depth data. By using Gaussian splatting for rendering, GSurf avoids the redundant volume rendering typically required in other GS and SDF integrations. Consequently, GSurf achieves faster training and rendering speeds while delivering 3D reconstruction quality comparable to neural implicit surface methods, such as VolSDF and NeuS. Experimental results across various benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in producing high-fidelity 3D reconstructions.</p></details> | <details><summary>see h...</summary><p>see https://github.com/xubaixinxbx/Gsurf</p></details> |

However, existing automatic methods exhibit artifacts under novel poses due to limited information in the input video. We propose AvatarPerfect, a novel system that allows users to iteratively refine 3DGS avatars by manually editing the rendered avatar images. In each iteration, our system suggests a new body and camera pose to help users identify and correct artifacts. The edited images are then used to update the current avatar, and our system suggests the next body and camera pose for further refinement. To investigate the effectiveness of AvatarPerfect, we conducted a user study comparing our method to an existing 3DGS editor SuperSplat, which allows direct manipulation of Gaussians without automatic pose suggestions. The results indicate that our system enables users to obtain higher quality refined 3DGS avatars than the existing 3DGS editor.</p></details> | 13 pages |

We introduce Specialized Generative Primitives, a generative framework that allows non-expert users to author high-quality 3D scenes in a seamless, lightweight, and controllable manner. Each primitive is an efficient generative model that captures the distribution of a single exemplar from the real world. With our framework, users capture a video of an environment, which we turn into a high-quality and explicit appearance model thanks to 3D Gaussian Splatting. Users then select regions of interest guided by semantically-aware features. To create a generative primitive, we adapt Generative Cellular Automata to single-exemplar training and controllable generation. We decouple the generative task from the appearance model by operating on sparse voxels and we recover a high-quality output with a subsequent sparse patch consistency step. Each primitive can be trained within 10 minutes and used to author new scenes interactively in a fully compositional manner. We showcase interactive sessions where various primitives are extracted from real-world scenes and controlled to create 3D assets and scenes in a few minutes. We also demonstrate additional capabilities of our primitives: handling various 3D representations to control generation, transferring appearances, and editing geometries.</p></details> |  |

Some researchers have explored using 3D GS for reconstructing driving scenes. However, these methods often rely on various data types, such as depth maps, 3D boxes, and trajectories of moving objects. Additionally, the lack of annotations for synthesized images limits their direct application in downstream tasks. To address these issues, we propose EGSRAL, a 3D GS-based method that relies solely on training images without extra annotations. EGSRAL enhances 3D GS's capability to model both dynamic objects and static backgrounds and introduces a novel adaptor for auto labeling, generating corresponding annotations based on existing annotations. We also propose a grouping strategy for vanilla 3D GS to address perspective issues in rendering large-scale, complex scenes. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets without any extra annotation. For example, the PSNR metric reaches 29.04 on the nuScenes dataset. Moreover, our automated labeling can significantly improve the performance of 2D/3D detection tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/jiangxb98/EGSRAL.</p></details> | AAAI2025 |

Previous weakly-supervised NeRF methods balance efficiency and accuracy, with mIoU varying by 5-10 points due to sampling count along camera rays. Recently, real-time Gaussian splatting has gained widespread popularity in 3D reconstruction, and the occupancy prediction task can also be viewed as a reconstruction task. Consequently, we propose GSRender, which naturally employs 3D Gaussian Splatting for occupancy prediction, simplifying the sampling process. In addition, the limitations of 2D supervision result in duplicate predictions along the same camera ray. We implemented the Ray Compensation (RC) module, which mitigates this issue by compensating for features from adjacent frames. Finally, we redesigned the loss to eliminate the impact of dynamic objects from adjacent frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves SOTA (state-of-the-art) results in RayIoU (+6.0), while narrowing the gap with 3D supervision methods. Our code will be released soon.</p></details> |  |

However, directly applying 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) as a refinement step following these models presents challenges. We hypothesize that the excessive positional degrees of freedom (DoFs) in Gaussians induce geometry distortion, fitting color patterns at the cost of structural fidelity. To address this, we propose reprojection-based DoF separation, a method distinguishing positional DoFs in terms of uncertainty: image-plane-parallel DoFs and ray-aligned DoF. To independently manage each DoF, we introduce a reprojection process along with tailored constraints for each DoF. Through experiments across various datasets, we confirm that separating the positional DoFs of Gaussians and applying targeted constraints effectively suppresses geometric artifacts, producing reconstruction results that are both visually and geometrically plausible.</p></details> | 11 pages |

While previous Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) representation have been prevalent for its implicit, coordinate-based model, the recent emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable potential in its explicit radiance field representation. By leveraging 3D Gaussian primitives for explicit scene representation and enabling differentiable rendering, 3DGS has shown significant advantages over other radiance fields in real-time rendering and photo-realistic performance, which is beneficial for robotic applications. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive understanding of 3DGS in the field of robotics. We divide our discussion of the related works into two main categories: the application of 3DGS and the advancements in 3DGS techniques. In the application section, we explore how 3DGS has been utilized in various robotics tasks from scene understanding and interaction perspectives. The advance of 3DGS section focuses on the improvements of 3DGS own properties in its adaptability and efficiency, aiming to enhance its performance in robotics. We then summarize the most commonly used datasets and evaluation metrics in robotics. Finally, we identify the challenges and limitations of current 3DGS methods and discuss the future development of 3DGS in robotics.</p></details> |  |

Although previous methods based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) can achieve impressive results, they lack fidelity and efficiency. Recent methods using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have improved rendering quality and real-time performance but still require significant storage overhead. In this paper, we introduce a method called GraphAvatar that utilizes Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to generate 3D Gaussians for the head avatar. Specifically, GraphAvatar trains a geometric GNN and an appearance GNN to generate the attributes of the 3D Gaussians from the tracked mesh. Therefore, our method can store the GNN models instead of the 3D Gaussians, significantly reducing the storage overhead to just 10MB. To reduce the impact of face-tracking errors, we also present a novel graph-guided optimization module to refine face-tracking parameters during training. Finally, we introduce a 3D-aware enhancer for post-processing to enhance the rendering quality. We conduct comprehensive experiments to demonstrate the advantages of GraphAvatar, surpassing existing methods in visual fidelity and storage consumption. The ablation study sheds light on the trade-offs between rendering quality and model size. The code will be released at: https://github.com/ucwxb/GraphAvatar</p></details> | accepted by AAAI2025 |

In this paper, we propose GAGS, a framework that distills 2D CLIP features into 3D Gaussian splatting, enabling open-vocabulary queries for renderings on arbitrary viewpoints. The main challenge of distilling 2D features for 3D fields lies in the multiview inconsistency of extracted 2D features, which provides unstable supervision for the 3D feature field. GAGS addresses this challenge with two novel strategies. First, GAGS associates the prompt point density of SAM with the camera distances, which significantly improves the multiview consistency of segmentation results. Second, GAGS further decodes a granularity factor to guide the distillation process and this granularity factor can be learned in a unsupervised manner to only select the multiview consistent 2D features in the distillation process. Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate significant performance and stability improvements of GAGS in visual grounding and semantic segmentation, with an inference speed 2$\times$ faster than baseline methods.

Moreover, we propose simultaneously optimizing multiple scan matching hypotheses in order to further increase the robustness of the system against local optima of the function. Finally, we fuse our Gaussian modeling and scan matching algorithms into an EKF radar-inertial odometry system designed after current best practices.

Recent methods like 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have become the preferred method for this task, providing high-quality novel views in real time. However, the training time of a 3DGS model is slow, often taking 30 minutes for a scene with 200 views. In contrast, our goal is to reduce the optimization time by training for fewer steps while maintaining high rendering quality. Specifically, we combine the guidance from both the position error and the appearance error to achieve a more effective densification. To balance the rate between adding new Gaussians and fitting old Gaussians, we develop a convergence-aware budget control mechanism. Moreover, to make the densification process more reliable, we selectively add new Gaussians from mostly visited regions. With these designs, we reduce the Gaussian optimization steps to one-third of the previous approach while achieving a comparable or even better novel view rendering quality. To further facilitate the rapid fitting of 4K resolution images, we introduce a dilation-based rendering technique. Our method, Turbo-GS, speeds up optimization for typical scenes and scales well to high-resolution (4K) scenarios on standard datasets. Through extensive experiments, we show that our method is significantly faster in optimization than other methods while retaining quality.

This calls for intuitive and effective methods to present sensor information. However, creating intuitive sensor data visualizations presents three key challenges: the variability of sensor readings, gaps in domain comprehension, and the dynamic nature of sensor data. To address these issues, we develop Vivar, a novel AR system that integrates multi-modal sensor data and presents 3D volumetric content for visualization. In particular, we introduce a cross-modal embedding approach that maps sensor data into a pre-trained visual embedding space through barycentric interpolation. This allows for accurate and continuous integration of multi-modal sensor information. Vivar also incorporates sensor-aware AR scene generation using foundation models and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) without requiring domain expertise. In addition, Vivar leverages latent reuse and caching strategies to accelerate 2D and AR content generation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our system achieves 11$\times$ latency reduction without compromising quality. A user study involving over 485 participants, including domain experts, demonstrates Vivar's effectiveness in accuracy, consistency, and real-world applicability, paving the way for more intuitive sensor data visualization.</p></details> |  |

These approaches create a 3D radiance field, parameterized by per-pixel 3D Gaussian primitives, from just a few images in a single forward pass. However, unlike multi-view methods that benefit from cross-view correspondences, 3D scene reconstruction with a single-view image remains an underexplored area. In this work, we introduce CATSplat, a novel generalizable transformer-based framework designed to break through the inherent constraints in monocular settings. First, we propose leveraging textual guidance from a visual-language model to complement insufficient information from a single image. By incorporating scene-specific contextual details from text embeddings through cross-attention, we pave the way for context-aware 3D scene reconstruction beyond relying solely on visual cues. Moreover, we advocate utilizing spatial guidance from 3D point features toward comprehensive geometric understanding under single-view settings. With 3D priors, image features can capture rich structural insights for predicting 3D Gaussians without multi-view techniques. Extensive experiments on large-scale datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of CATSplat in single-view 3D scene reconstruction with high-quality novel view synthesis.</p></details> |  |

The agent uses this world model to restore a shuffled scene to its original configuration, making an accurate representation of the world essential for successfully completing the task. In this work, we present a novel framework that leverages on 3D Gaussian Splatting as a 3D scene representation for experience goal visual rearrangement task. Recent advances in volumetric scene representation like 3D Gaussian Splatting, offer fast rendering of high quality and photo-realistic novel views. Our approach enables the agent to have consistent views of the current and the goal setting of the rearrangement task, which enables the agent to directly compare the goal state and the shuffled state of the world in image space. To compare these views, we propose to use a dense feature matching method with visual features extracted from a foundation model, leveraging its advantages of a more universal feature representation, which facilitates robustness, and generalization. We validate our approach on the AI2-THOR rearrangement challenge benchmark and demonstrate improvements over the current state of the art methods</p></details> |  |

However, due to its rasterization-based formulation, 3DGS is constrained to ideal pinhole cameras and lacks support for secondary lighting effects. Recent methods address these limitations by tracing volumetric particles instead, however, this comes at the cost of significantly slower rendering speeds. In this work, we propose 3D Gaussian Unscented Transform (3DGUT), replacing the EWA splatting formulation in 3DGS with the Unscented Transform that approximates the particles through sigma points, which can be projected exactly under any nonlinear projection function. This modification enables trivial support of distorted cameras with time dependent effects such as rolling shutter, while retaining the efficiency of rasterization. Additionally, we align our rendering formulation with that of tracing-based methods, enabling secondary ray tracing required to represent phenomena such as reflections and refraction within the same 3D representation.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods face several constraints, such as requiring multi-view data, time-consuming per-scene optimization, low visual quality in backgrounds, and distorted reconstructions in unseen areas. We propose a novel pipeline to overcome these limitations. Specifically, we introduce a large-scale reconstruction model that uses latents from a video diffusion model to predict 3D Gaussian Splattings for the scenes in a feed-forward manner. The video diffusion model is designed to create videos precisely following specified camera trajectories, allowing it to generate compressed video latents that contain multi-view information while maintaining 3D consistency. We train the 3D reconstruction model to operate on the video latent space with a progressive training strategy, enabling the efficient generation of high-quality, wide-scope, and generic 3D scenes. Extensive evaluations across various datasets demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms existing methods for single-view 3D scene generation, particularly with out-of-domain images. For the first time, we demonstrate that a 3D reconstruction model can be effectively built upon the latent space of a diffusion model to realize efficient 3D scene generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://snap-research.github.io/wonderland/</p></details> |

However, conventional methods require high-frame-rate dense and high-quality sharp images, which are time-consuming and inefficient to capture, especially in dynamic environments. Event cameras, with their high temporal resolution and ability to capture asynchronous brightness changes, offer a promising alternative for more reliable scene reconstruction without motion blur. In this paper, we propose SweepEvGS, a novel hardware-integrated method that leverages event cameras for robust and accurate novel view synthesis across various imaging settings from a single sweep. SweepEvGS utilizes the initial static frame with dense event streams captured during a single camera sweep to effectively reconstruct detailed scene views. We also introduce different real-world hardware imaging systems for real-world data collection and evaluation for future research. We validate the robustness and efficiency of SweepEvGS through experiments in three different imaging settings: synthetic objects, real-world macro-level, and real-world micro-level view synthesis. Our results demonstrate that SweepEvGS surpasses existing methods in visual rendering quality, rendering speed, and computational efficiency, highlighting its potential for dynamic practical applications.</p></details> |  |

However, current methods rely on 2D diffusion models without adequately considering multi-view information, resulting in multi-view inconsistency. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) significantly improves rendering quality and speed, its 3D editing process encounters difficulties with inefficient optimization, as pre-trained Gaussians retain excessive source information, hindering optimization. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{EditSplat}, a novel 3D editing framework that integrates Multi-view Fusion Guidance (MFG) and Attention-Guided Trimming (AGT). Our MFG ensures multi-view consistency by incorporating essential multi-view information into the diffusion process, leveraging classifier-free guidance from the text-to-image diffusion model and the geometric properties of 3DGS. Additionally, our AGT leverages the explicit representation of 3DGS to selectively prune and optimize 3D Gaussians, enhancing optimization efficiency and enabling precise, semantically rich local edits. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations, EditSplat achieves superior multi-view consistency and editing quality over existing methods, significantly enhancing overall efficiency.</p></details> |  |

However, they only process a pair of views at a time to infer pixel-aligned pointmaps. When dealing with more than two views, a combinatorial number of error prone pairwise reconstructions are usually followed by an expensive global optimization, which often fails to rectify the pairwise reconstruction errors. To handle more views, reduce errors, and improve inference time, we propose the fast single-stage feed-forward network MV-DUSt3R. At its core are multi-view decoder blocks which exchange information across any number of views while considering one reference view. To make our method robust to reference view selection, we further propose MV-DUSt3R+, which employs cross-reference-view blocks to fuse information across different reference view choices. To further enable novel view synthesis, we extend both by adding and jointly training Gaussian splatting heads. Experiments on multi-view stereo reconstruction, multi-view pose estimation, and novel view synthesis confirm that our methods improve significantly upon prior art. Code will be released.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we investigate the theoretical performance of the stochastic MV-PURE estimator under varying levels of additive noise. We prove that the mean-square-error (MSE) of this estimator in the low signal-to-noise (SNR) region is much smaller than that obtained with its full-rank version, the minimum-variance distortionless estimator, and the gap becomes larger as the noise level increases. These results shed light on the excellent performance of the stochastic MV-PURE estimator in highly noisy settings obtained in simulations so far. Furthermore, we extend previous numerical simulations to show how the insight gained from the results of this paper can be used in practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>Journ...</summary><p>Journal of the Franklin Institute, 2014</p></details> |

Generalizable and MVS-based NeRFs, although capable of mitigating training time, often incur tradeoffs in quality. This paper presents a novel approach called BoostMVSNeRFs to enhance the rendering quality of MVS-based NeRFs in large-scale scenes. We first identify limitations in MVS-based NeRF methods, such as restricted viewport coverage and artifacts due to limited input views. Then, we address these limitations by proposing a new method that selects and combines multiple cost volumes during volume rendering. Our method does not require training and can adapt to any MVS-based NeRF methods in a feed-forward fashion to improve rendering quality. Furthermore, our approach is also end-to-end trainable, allowing fine-tuning on specific scenes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through experiments on large-scale datasets, showing significant rendering quality improvements in large-scale scenes and unbounded outdoor scenarios.

The proposed IBL has two impedance booting loops for compensating leakage current due to parasitic capacitance from the ESD pad and external interconnections, and the chopper. By shifting the compensation node from the feedback pathway to the amplifier's inputs, this work realizes a higher-resolution compensation, boosting the input impedance of the AFE to several tens of G{\Omega}. The proposed DSL consists of a coarse DSL driven by DC supply voltages and a fine DSL driven by five phase-interleaving pulse-width modulated waveforms (PI-PWM). Avoiding the usage of delta-sigma CDAC, the energy efficiency is better than conventional DSLs. Designed in a 0.18-{\mu}m CMOS process, the AFE consumes 4.5 {\mu}A from a 1.2-V supply. The simulated input referred noise is 0.27 {\mu}Vrms from 0.5 to 100 Hz in the presence of a 384-mV EDO. With a 10-pF parasitic capacitance, the proposed AFE achieves an input impedance of more than 74.5 G{\Omega} at 1 Hz and 6.4 G{\Omega} at 50 Hz. The simulation results have been robust under 100 Monte-Carlo samples.</p></details> |  |

In clinical practice, however, radiologists concurrently examine all views within a mammography exam, leveraging the inherent correlations in these views to effectively detect tumors. Acknowledging the significance of multi-view analysis, some studies have introduced methods that independently process mammogram views, either through distinct convolutional branches or simple fusion strategies, inadvertently leading to a loss of crucial inter-view correlations. In this paper, we propose an innovative multi-view network exclusively based on transformers to address challenges in mammographic image classification. Our approach introduces a novel shifted window-based dynamic attention block, facilitating the effective integration of multi-view information and promoting the coherent transfer of this information between views at the spatial feature map level. Furthermore, we conduct a comprehensive comparative analysis of the performance and effectiveness of transformer-based models under diverse settings, employing the CBIS-DDSM and Vin-Dr Mammo datasets.

We propose depth discontinuity learning for MVS methods, which further improves accuracy while retaining the completeness of the reconstruction. Our idea is to jointly estimate the depth and boundary maps where the boundary maps are explicitly used for further refinement of the depth maps. We validate our idea and demonstrate that our strategies can be easily integrated into the existing learning-based MVS pipeline where the reconstruction depends on high-quality depth map estimation. Extensive experiments on various datasets show that our method improves reconstruction quality compared to baseline. Experiments also demonstrate that the presented model and strategies have good generalization capabilities. The source code will be available soon.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep PatchMatch MVS with Learned Patch Coplanarity, Geometric Consistency and Adaptive Pixel Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07582v1)** | 2022-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work in multi-view stereo (MVS) combines learnable photometric scores and regularization with PatchMatch-based optimization to achieve robust pixelwise estimates of depth, normals, and visibility. However, non-learning based methods still outperform for large scenes with sparse views, in part due to use of geometric consistency constraints and ability to optimize over many views at high resolution. In this paper, we build on learning-based approaches to improve photometric scores by learning patch coplanarity and encourage geometric consistency by learning a scaled photometric cost that can be combined with reprojection error. We also propose an adaptive pixel sampling strategy for candidate propagation that reduces memory to enable training on larger resolution with more views and a larger encoder. These modifications lead to 6-15% gains in accuracy and completeness on the challenging ETH3D benchmark, resulting in higher F1 performance than the widely used state-of-the-art non-learning approaches ACMM and ACMP.</p></details> |  |

For multi-view camera-only 3D detection, methods based on bird-eye-view or 3D geometric representations can leverage the stereo cues from overlapped regions between adjacent views and directly perform 3D detection without hand-crafted post-processing. However, it lacks direct semantic supervision for 2D backbones, which can be complemented by pretraining simple monocular-based detectors. Our solution is a multi-view framework for 4D detection following this paradigm. It is built upon a simple monocular detector FCOS3D++, pretrained only with object annotations of Waymo, and converts multi-view features to a 3D grid space to detect 3D objects thereon. A dual-path neck for single-frame understanding and temporal stereo matching is devised to incorporate multi-frame information. Our method finally achieves 49.75% mAPL with a single model and wins 2nd place in the WOD challenge, without any LiDAR-based depth supervision during training.

Unlike existing works focusing on semantic segmentation of urban scenes, the emphasis of this work lies in detecting and segmenting 3D building instances even if they are attached and embedded in a large and imprecise 3D surface model. Multi-view RGB images are first enhanced to RGBH images by adding a heightmap and are segmented to obtain all roof instances using a fine-tuned 2D instance segmentation neural network. Instance masks from different multi-view images are then clustered into global masks. Our mask clustering accounts for spatial occlusion and overlapping, which can eliminate segmentation ambiguities among multi-view images. Based on these global masks, 3D roof instances are segmented out by mask back-projections and extended to the entire building instances through a Markov random field optimization. A new dataset that contains instance-level annotation for both 3D urban scenes (roofs and buildings) and drone images (roofs) is provided. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first outdoor dataset dedicated to 3D instance segmentation with much more annotations of attached 3D buildings than existing datasets. Quantitative evaluations and ablation studies have shown the effectiveness of all major steps and the advantages of our multi-view framework over the orthophoto-based method.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 fi...</summary><p>14 figures, 12 figures</p></details> |

Oftentimes, some of these sources, like Machine-Learning systems, are not strictly binary but associated with some degree of (lack of) confidence in the observation. We propose MV-Datalog and MV-Datalog+- as extensions of Datalog and Datalog+-, respectively, to the fuzzy semantics of infinite-valued Lukasiewicz logic L as languages for effectively reasoning in scenarios where such uncertain observations occur. We show that the semantics of MV-Datalog exhibits similar model-theoretic properties as Datalog. In particular, we show that (fuzzy) entailment can be decided via minimal fuzzy models. We show that when they exist, such minimal fuzzy models are unique (when they exist) and can be characterised in terms of a linear optimisation problem over the output of a fixed-point procedure. On the basis of this characterisation, we propose similar many-valued semantics for rules with existential quantification in the head, extending Datalog+-. This paper is under consideration for acceptance in TPLP.</p></details> |  |

The data estimated by FaSS-MVS, in turn, facilitates online 3D mapping, meaning that a 3D map of the scene is immediately and incrementally generated while the image data is acquired or being received. FaSS-MVS is comprised of a hierarchical processing scheme in which depth and normal data, as well as corresponding confidence scores, are estimated in a coarse-to-fine manner, allowing to efficiently process large scene depths which are inherent to oblique imagery captured by low-flying UAVs. The actual depth estimation employs a plane-sweep algorithm for dense multi-image matching to produce depth hypotheses from which the actual depth map is extracted by means of a surface-aware semi-global optimization, reducing the fronto-parallel bias of SGM. Given the estimated depth map, the pixel-wise surface normal information is then computed by reprojecting the depth map into a point cloud and calculating the normal vectors within a confined local neighborhood. In a thorough quantitative and ablative study we show that the accuracies of the 3D information calculated by FaSS-MVS is close to that of state-of-the-art approaches for offline multi-view stereo, with the error not even being one magnitude higher than that of COLMAP. At the same time, however, the average run-time of FaSS-MVS to estimate a single depth and normal map is less than 14 % of that of COLMAP, allowing to perform an online and incremental processing of Full-HD imagery at 1-2 Hz.</p></details> |  |

However, non-learning based approaches still outperform for scenes with large depth ranges and sparser wide-baseline views, in part due to their PatchMatch optimization over pixelwise estimates of depth, normals, and visibility. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end trainable PatchMatch-based MVS approach that combines advantages of trainable costs and regularizations with pixelwise estimates. To overcome the challenge of the non-differentiable PatchMatch optimization that involves iterative sampling and hard decisions, we use reinforcement learning to minimize expected photometric cost and maximize likelihood of ground truth depth and normals. We incorporate normal estimation by using dilated patch kernels, and propose a recurrent cost regularization that applies beyond frontal plane-sweep algorithms to our pixelwise depth/normal estimates. We evaluate our method on widely used MVS benchmarks, ETH3D and Tanks and Temples (TnT), and compare to other state of the art learning based MVS models. On ETH3D, our method outperforms other recent learning-based approaches and performs comparably on advanced TnT.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2021 for oral presentation</p></details> |

A joint motion vector (MV) and residual prediction network MV-Residual is designed to extract the ensembled features of motion representations and residual information by treating the two successive frames as inputs. The prior probability of the latent representations is modeled by a hyperprior autoencoder and trained jointly with the MV-Residual network. Specially, the spatially-displaced convolution is applied for video frame prediction, in which a motion kernel for each pixel is learned to generate predicted pixel by applying the kernel at a displaced location in the source image. Finally, novel rate allocation and post-processing strategies are used to produce the final compressed bits, considering the bits constraint of the challenge. The experimental results on validation set show that the proposed optimized framework can generate the highest MS-SSIM for P-frame compression competition.</p></details> |  |

The topology estimation is a critical step to ensure the robustness of distribution grid operation. However, the bus connectivity and grid topology estimation are usually hard in distribution grids. For example, it is technically challenging and costly to monitor the bus connectivity in urban grids, e.g., underground lines. It is also inappropriate to use the radial topology assumption exclusively because the grids of metropolitan cities and regions with dense loads could be with many mesh structures. To resolve these drawbacks, we propose a data-driven topology estimation method for MV and LV distribution grids by only utilizing the historical smart meter measurements. Particularly, a probabilistic graphical model is utilized to capture the statistical dependencies amongst bus voltages. We prove that the bus connectivity and grid topology estimation problems, in radial and mesh structures, can be formulated as a linear regression with a least absolute shrinkage regularization on grouped variables (\textit{group lasso}). Simulations show highly accurate results in eight MV and LV distribution networks at different sizes and 22 topology configurations using PG\&E residential smart meter data.</p></details> | 15 pages, 16 figures |

The One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) is a state-of-the-art algorithm for estimating such regions from high dimensional data. Yet it suffers from practical limitations. When applied to a limited number of samples it can lead to poor performance even when picking the best hyperparameters. Moreover the solution of OCSVM is very sensitive to the selection of hyperparameters which makes it hard to optimize in an unsupervised setting. We present a new approach to estimate MV sets using the OCSVM with a different choice of the parameter controlling the proportion of outliers. The solution function of the OCSVM is learnt on a training set and the desired probability mass is obtained by adjusting the offset on a test set to prevent overfitting. Models learnt on different train/test splits are then aggregated to reduce the variance induced by such random splits. Our approach makes it possible to tune the hyperparameters automatically and obtain nested set estimates. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms the standard OCSVM formulation while suffering less from the curse of dimensionality than kernel density estimates. Results on actual data sets are also presented.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE DSAA' 2015, Oct 2015, Paris, France</p></details> |

Efforts to enhance spatial reasoning abilities through supplementary spatial data and fine-tuning have proven limited and ineffective when addressing complex embodied tasks, largely due to their dependence on language-based outputs. While some approaches have introduced a point-based action space to mitigate this issue, they fall short in managing more intricate tasks within complex environments. This deficiency arises from their failure to fully exploit the inherent thinking and reasoning capabilities that are fundamental strengths of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach named SpatialCoT, specifically designed to bolster the spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs. Our approach comprises two stages: spatial coordinate bi-directional alignment, which aligns vision-language inputs with spatial coordinates, and chain-of-thought spatial grounding, which harnesses the reasoning capabilities of language models for advanced spatial reasoning. We evaluate SpatialCoT on challenging navigation and manipulation tasks, both in simulation and real-world settings. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches in both tasks.</p></details> | Under Review |

Existing benchmarks for evaluating MLLMs primarily utilize static images or videos, limiting assessments to non-interactive scenarios. Meanwhile, existing embodied AI benchmarks are task-specific and not diverse enough, which do not adequately evaluate the embodied capabilities of MLLMs. To address this, we propose EmbodiedEval, a comprehensive and interactive evaluation benchmark for MLLMs with embodied tasks. EmbodiedEval features 328 distinct tasks within 125 varied 3D scenes, each of which is rigorously selected and annotated. It covers a broad spectrum of existing embodied AI tasks with significantly enhanced diversity, all within a unified simulation and evaluation framework tailored for MLLMs. The tasks are organized into five categories: navigation, object interaction, social interaction, attribute question answering, and spatial question answering to assess different capabilities of the agents. We evaluated the state-of-the-art MLLMs on EmbodiedEval and found that they have a significant shortfall compared to human level on embodied tasks. Our analysis demonstrates the limitations of existing MLLMs in embodied capabilities, providing insights for their future development. We open-source all evaluation data and simulation framework at https://github.com/thunlp/EmbodiedEval.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we take a step toward this goal by introducing GenEx, a system capable of planning complex embodied world exploration, guided by its generative imagination that forms priors (expectations) about the surrounding environments. GenEx generates an entire 3D-consistent imaginative environment from as little as a single RGB image, bringing it to life through panoramic video streams. Leveraging scalable 3D world data curated from Unreal Engine, our generative model is rounded in the physical world. It captures a continuous 360-degree environment with little effort, offering a boundless landscape for AI agents to explore and interact with. GenEx achieves high-quality world generation, robust loop consistency over long trajectories, and demonstrates strong 3D capabilities such as consistency and active 3D mapping. Powered by generative imagination of the world, GPT-assisted agents are equipped to perform complex embodied tasks, including both goal-agnostic exploration and goal-driven navigation. These agents utilize predictive expectation regarding unseen parts of the physical world to refine their beliefs, simulate different outcomes based on potential decisions, and make more informed choices.

While a significant body of work has been leveraging LLMs for decision making in embodied environments, we still lack a systematic understanding of their performance because they are usually applied in different domains, for different purposes, and built based on different inputs and outputs. Furthermore, existing evaluations tend to rely solely on a final success rate, making it difficult to pinpoint what ability is missing in LLMs and where the problem lies, which in turn blocks embodied agents from leveraging LLMs effectively and selectively. To address these limitations, we propose a generalized interface (Embodied Agent Interface) that supports the formalization of various types of tasks and input-output specifications of LLM-based modules. Specifically, it allows us to unify 1) a broad set of embodied decision-making tasks involving both state and temporally extended goals, 2) four commonly-used LLM-based modules for decision making: goal interpretation, subgoal decomposition, action sequencing, and transition modeling, and 3) a collection of fine-grained metrics which break down evaluation into various types of errors, such as hallucination errors, affordance errors, various types of planning errors, etc. Overall, our benchmark offers a comprehensive assessment of LLMs' performance for different subtasks, pinpointing the strengths and weaknesses in LLM-powered embodied AI systems, and providing insights for effective and selective use of LLMs in embodied decision making.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for oral presentation at NeurIPS 2024 in the Datasets and Benchmarks track.

However, a standardized, closed-loop benchmark for evaluating their spatial reasoning and sequential decision-making capabilities is lacking. To address this, we present MetaVQA: a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess and enhance VLMs' understanding of spatial relationships and scene dynamics through Visual Question Answering (VQA) and closed-loop simulations. MetaVQA leverages Set-of-Mark prompting and top-down view ground-truth annotations from nuScenes and Waymo datasets to automatically generate extensive question-answer pairs based on diverse real-world traffic scenarios, ensuring object-centric and context-rich instructions. Our experiments show that fine-tuning VLMs with the MetaVQA dataset significantly improves their spatial reasoning and embodied scene comprehension in safety-critical simulations, evident not only in improved VQA accuracies but also in emerging safety-aware driving maneuvers. In addition, the learning demonstrates strong transferability from simulation to real-world observation.

However, many sectors, such as manufacturing, healthcare, and logistics, demand AI systems capable of extending their intelligence into the physical world, interacting directly with objects, environments, and dynamic conditions. This need has led to the emergence of Physical AI Agents--systems that integrate cognitive reasoning, powered by specialized LLMs, with precise physical actions to perform real-world tasks. This work introduces Physical AI Agents as an evolution of shared principles with Vertical AI Agents, tailored for physical interaction. We propose a modular architecture with three core blocks--perception, cognition, and actuation--offering a scalable framework for diverse industries. Additionally, we present the Physical Retrieval Augmented Generation (Ph-RAG) design pattern, which connects physical intelligence to industry-specific LLMs for real-time decision-making and reporting informed by physical context. Through case studies, we demonstrate how Physical AI Agents and the Ph-RAG framework are transforming industries like autonomous vehicles, warehouse robotics, healthcare, and manufacturing, offering businesses a pathway to integrate embodied AI for operational efficiency and innovation.</p></details> | 27 pages, 3 figures |

Detection and Localization of Instruction Errors in Vision-and-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10700v2)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) is one of the most intuitive yet challenging embodied AI tasks. Agents are tasked to navigate towards a target goal by executing a set of low-level actions, following a series of natural language instructions. All VLN-CE methods in the literature assume that language instructions are exact. However, in practice, instructions given by humans can contain errors when describing a spatial environment due to inaccurate memory or confusion. Current VLN-CE benchmarks do not address this scenario, making the state-of-the-art methods in VLN-CE fragile in the presence of erroneous instructions from human users. For the first time, we propose a novel benchmark dataset that introduces various types of instruction errors considering potential human causes. This benchmark provides valuable insight into the robustness of VLN systems in continuous environments. We observe a noticeable performance drop (up to -25%) in Success Rate when evaluating the state-of-the-art VLN-CE methods on our benchmark. Moreover, we formally define the task of Instruction Error Detection and Localization, and establish an evaluation protocol on top of our benchmark dataset. We also propose an effective method, based on a cross-modal transformer architecture, that achieves the best performance in error detection and localization, compared to baselines. Surprisingly, our proposed method has revealed errors in the validation set of the two commonly used datasets for VLN-CE, i.e., R2R-CE and RxR-CE, demonstrating the utility of our technique in other tasks.

However, tasks such as object search have largely focused on efficient policy learning. In this work, we identify several gaps in current search methods: They largely focus on dated perception models, neglect temporal aggregation, and transfer from ground truth directly to noisy perception at test time, without accounting for the resulting overconfidence in the perceived state. We address the identified problems through calibrated perception probabilities and uncertainty across aggregation and found decisions, thereby adapting the models for sequential tasks. The resulting methods can be directly integrated with pretrained models across a wide family of existing search approaches at no additional training cost. We perform extensive evaluations of aggregation methods across both different semantic perception models and policies, confirming the importance of calibrated uncertainties in both the aggregation and found decisions. We make the code and trained models available at https://semantic-search.cs.uni-freiburg.de.</p></details> |  |

Powered by modern AI technologies such as multimodal large language models and world models, Embodied AI (EmAI) represents a transformative frontier, offering enhanced autonomy and the ability to interact with the physical world to address these challenges. As an interdisciplinary and rapidly evolving research domain, "EmAI in healthcare" spans diverse fields such as algorithms, robotics, and biomedicine. This complexity underscores the importance of timely reviews and analyses to track advancements, address challenges, and foster cross-disciplinary collaboration. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the "brain" of EmAI for healthcare, wherein we introduce foundational AI algorithms for perception, actuation, planning, and memory, and focus on presenting the healthcare applications spanning clinical interventions, daily care & companionship, infrastructure support, and biomedical research. Despite its promise, the development of EmAI for healthcare is hindered by critical challenges such as safety concerns, gaps between simulation platforms and real-world applications, the absence of standardized benchmarks, and uneven progress across interdisciplinary domains. We discuss the technical barriers and explore ethical considerations, offering a forward-looking perspective on the future of EmAI in healthcare. A hierarchical framework of intelligent levels for EmAI systems is also introduced to guide further development. By providing systematic insights, this work aims to inspire innovation and practical applications, paving the way for a new era of intelligent, patient-centered healthcare.</p></details> | 44 pages, 11 figures |

Among many skills that the agents need to possess, building and maintaining a semantic map of the environment is most crucial in long-horizon tasks. A semantic map captures information about the environment in a structured way, allowing the agent to reference it for advanced reasoning throughout the task. While existing surveys in embodied AI focus on general advancements or specific tasks like navigation and manipulation, this paper provides a comprehensive review of semantic map-building approaches in embodied AI, specifically for indoor navigation. We categorize these approaches based on their structural representation (spatial grids, topological graphs, dense point-clouds or hybrid maps) and the type of information they encode (implicit features or explicit environmental data). We also explore the strengths and limitations of the map building techniques, highlight current challenges, and propose future research directions. We identify that the field is moving towards developing open-vocabulary, queryable, task-agnostic map representations, while high memory demands and computational inefficiency still remaining to be open challenges. This survey aims to guide current and future researchers in advancing semantic mapping techniques for embodied AI systems.</p></details> |  |

Unlike prior studies that explored this as long-form video understanding and utilized egocentric video only, we instead propose an LLM-based agent, Embodied VideoAgent, which constructs scene memory from both egocentric video and embodied sensory inputs (e.g. depth and pose sensing). We further introduce a VLM-based approach to automatically update the memory when actions or activities over objects are perceived. Embodied VideoAgent attains significant advantages over counterparts in challenging reasoning and planning tasks in 3D scenes, achieving gains of 4.9% on Ego4D-VQ3D, 5.8% on OpenEQA, and 11.7% on EnvQA.

Recent works utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate enriched action step description texts to guide action step decoding. Although LLMs are introduced, these methods decode the action steps into a closed-set of one-hot vectors, limiting the model's capability of generalizing to new steps or tasks. Additionally, fixed action step descriptions based on world-level commonsense may contain noise in specific instances of visual states. In this paper, we propose PlanLLM, a cross-modal joint learning framework with LLMs for video procedure planning. We propose an LLM-Enhanced Planning module which fully uses the generalization ability of LLMs to produce free-form planning output and to enhance action step decoding. We also propose Mutual Information Maximization module to connect world-level commonsense of step descriptions and sample-specific information of visual states, enabling LLMs to employ the reasoning ability to generate step sequences. With the assistance of LLMs, our method can both closed-set and open vocabulary procedure planning tasks. Our PlanLLM achieves superior performance on three benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our designs.</p></details> | accepted to AAAI2025 |

Such models are useful for embodied AI and scene retrieval applications, which involve searching for objects or patterns using natural language descriptions. While recent works have focused on LLM-based scaling of 3DVG datasets, these datasets do not capture the full range of potential prompts which could be specified in the English language. To ensure that we are scaling up and testing against a useful and representative set of prompts, we propose a framework for linguistically analyzing 3DVG prompts and introduce Visual Grounding with Diverse Language in 3D (ViGiL3D), a diagnostic dataset for evaluating visual grounding methods against a diverse set of language patterns. We evaluate existing open-vocabulary 3DVG methods to demonstrate that these methods are not yet proficient in understanding and identifying the targets of more challenging, out-of-distribution prompts, toward real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages with 5 figures and 11 tables</p></details> |

The proposed framework aims to optimize both data transmission efficiency and decision accuracy by formulating an optimization problem that incorporates the Weber-Fechner law, serving as a metric for balancing bandwidth utilization and quality of experience (QoE). Specifically, we employ the large language and vision assistant (LLAVA) model to extract critical semantic information from raw image data captured by embodied AI agents (i.e., vehicles), reducing transmission data size by approximately more than 90\% while retaining essential content for vehicular communication and decision-making. In the dynamic vehicular environment, we employ a generalized advantage estimation-based proximal policy optimization (GAE-PPO) method to stabilize decision-making under uncertainty. Simulation results show that attention maps from LLAVA highlight the model's focus on relevant image regions, enhancing semantic representation accuracy. Additionally, our proposed transmission strategy improves QoE by up to 36\% compared to DDPG and accelerates convergence by reducing required steps by up to 47\% compared to pure PPO. Further analysis indicates that adapting semantic symbol length provides an effective trade-off between transmission quality and bandwidth, achieving up to a 61.4\% improvement in QoE when scaling from 4 to 8 vehicles.</p></details> | 14 pages, 10 figures |

However, for robot-generated content (RGC), will its image quality be consistent with the Moravec paradox and counter to human common sense? Human subjective scoring is more based on the attractiveness of the image. Embodied agent are required to interact and perceive in the environment, and finally perform specific tasks. Visual images as inputs directly influence downstream tasks. In this paper, we first propose an embodied image quality assessment (EIQA) frameworks. We establish assessment metrics for input images based on the downstream tasks of robot. In addition, we construct an Embodied Preference Database (EPD) containing 5,000 reference and distorted image annotations. The performance of mainstream IQA algorithms on EPD dataset is finally verified. The experiments demonstrate that quality assessment of embodied images is different from that of humans. We sincerely hope that the EPD can contribute to the development of embodied AI by focusing on image quality assessment.

However, LAE also faces challenges in data collection and processing efficiency, flight control precision, and network performance. The challenges could be solved by realizing an integration of sensing, communications, computation, and control (ISC3) for LAE. In this regard, embodied artificial intelligence (EAI), with its unique perception, planning, and decision-making capabilities, offers a promising solution to realize ISC3. Specifically, this paper investigates an application of EAI into ISC3 to support LAE, exploring potential research focuses, solutions, and case study. We begin by outlining rationales and benefits of introducing EAI into LAE, followed by reviewing research directions and solutions for EAI in ISC3. We then propose a framework of an EAI-enabled ISC3 for LAE. The framework's effectiveness is evaluated through a case study of express delivery utilizing an EAI-enabled UAV. Finally, we discuss several future research directions for advancing EAI-enabled LAE.</p></details> |  |

While these approaches, which combine high-level planners with low-level controllers, show promise, low-level controllers frequently become performance bottlenecks due to repeated failures. In this paper, we argue that the primary cause of failure in many low-level controllers is the absence of an episodic memory system. To address this, we introduce MrSteve (Memory Recall Steve-1), a novel low-level controller equipped with Place Event Memory (PEM), a form of episodic memory that captures what, where, and when information from episodes. This directly addresses the main limitation of the popular low-level controller, Steve-1. Unlike previous models that rely on short-term memory, PEM organizes spatial and event-based data, enabling efficient recall and navigation in long-horizon tasks. Additionally, we propose an Exploration Strategy and a Memory-Augmented Task Solving Framework, allowing agents to alternate between exploration and task-solving based on recalled events. Our approach significantly improves task-solving and exploration efficiency compared to existing methods. We will release our code and demos on the project page: https://sites.google.com/view/mr-steve.</p></details> |  |

Our GameFi ecosystem aims to fundamentally transform this landscape by integrating advanced embodied AI agents into GameFi platforms. These AI agents, developed using cutting-edge large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 and Claude AI, are capable of proactive, adaptive, and contextually rich interactions with players. By going beyond traditional scripted responses, these agents become integral participants in the game's narrative and economic systems, directly influencing player strategies and in-game economies. We address the limitations of current GameFi platforms, which often lack immersive AI interactions and mechanisms for community engagement or creator monetization. Through the deep integration of AI agents with blockchain technology, we establish a consensus-driven, decentralized GameFi ecosystem. This ecosystem empowers creators to monetize their contributions and fosters democratic collaboration among players and creators. Furthermore, by embedding DeFi mechanisms into the gaming experience, we enhance economic participation and provide new opportunities for financial interactions within the game. Our approach enhances player immersion and retention and advances the GameFi ecosystem by bridging traditional gaming with Web3 technologies. By integrating sophisticated AI and DeFi elements, we contribute to the development of more engaging, economically robust, and community-centric gaming environments.

While existing methods can synthesize realistic human motions in 3D scenes and generate plausible human-object interactions, they heavily rely on datasets containing paired 3D scene and motion capture data, which are expensive and time-consuming to collect across diverse environments and interactions. We present ZeroHSI, a novel approach that enables zero-shot 4D human-scene interaction synthesis by integrating video generation and neural human rendering. Our key insight is to leverage the rich motion priors learned by state-of-the-art video generation models, which have been trained on vast amounts of natural human movements and interactions, and use differentiable rendering to reconstruct human-scene interactions. ZeroHSI can synthesize realistic human motions in both static scenes and environments with dynamic objects, without requiring any ground-truth motion data. We evaluate ZeroHSI on a curated dataset of different types of various indoor and outdoor scenes with different interaction prompts, demonstrating its ability to generate diverse and contextually appropriate human-scene interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://awfuact.github.io/zerohsi/</p></details> |

Despite significant progress in handling complex environments using deep reinforcement learning, current PGN methods are designed for single-robot systems, limiting their generalizability to multi-robot scenarios with diverse platforms. This paper addresses this limitation by proposing a knowledge transfer framework for PGN, allowing a teacher robot to transfer its learned navigation model to student robots, including those with unknown or black-box platforms. We introduce a novel knowledge distillation (KD) framework that transfers first-person-view (FPV) representations (view images, turning/forward actions) to universally applicable third-person-view (TPV) representations (local maps, subgoals). The state is redefined as reconstructed local maps using SLAM, while actions are mapped to subgoals on a predefined grid. To enhance training efficiency, we propose a sampling-efficient KD approach that aligns training episodes via a noise-robust local map descriptor (LMD). Although validated on 2D wheeled robots, this method can be extended to 3D action spaces, such as drones. Experiments conducted in Habitat-Sim demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed framework, requiring minimal implementation effort. This study highlights the potential for scalable and cross-platform PGN solutions, expanding the applicability of embodied AI systems in multi-robot scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Draft...</summary><p>Draft version of a conference paper: 5 pages with 2 figures</p></details> |

In this paper, we demystified how traditional LLM jailbreak attacks behave in the Embodied AI context. We conducted a comprehensive safety analysis of the LLM-based planning module of embodied AI systems against jailbreak attacks. Using the carefully crafted Harmful-RLbench, we accessed 20 open-source and proprietary LLMs under traditional jailbreak attacks, and highlighted two key challenges when adopting the prior jailbreak techniques to embodied AI contexts: (1) The harmful text output by LLMs does not necessarily induce harmful policies in Embodied AI context, and (2) even we can generate harmful policies, we have to guarantee they are executable in practice. To overcome those challenges, we propose Policy Executable (POEX) jailbreak attacks, where harmful instructions and optimized suffixes are injected into LLM-based planning modules, leading embodied AI to perform harmful actions in both simulated and physical environments. Our approach involves constraining adversarial suffixes to evade detection and fine-tuning a policy evaluater to improve the executability of harmful policies. We conducted extensive experiments on both a robotic arm embodied AI platform and simulators, to validate the attack and policy success rates on 136 harmful instructions from Harmful-RLbench. Our findings expose serious safety vulnerabilities in LLM-based planning modules, including the ability of POEX to be transferred across models. Finally, we propose mitigation strategies, such as safety-constrained prompts, pre- and post-planning checks, to address these vulnerabilities and ensure the safe deployment of embodied AI in real-world settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Homep...</summary><p>Homepage: https://poex-eai-jailbreak.github.io/</p></details> |

However, due to the lack of comprehensive 3D benchmarks, the capabilities of 3D models in real-world scenes, particularly those that are challenging with subtly distinguished objects, remain insufficiently investigated. To facilitate a more thorough evaluation of 3D models' capabilities, we propose a scheme, ObjVariantEnsemble, to systematically introduce more scenes with specified object classes, colors, shapes, quantities, and spatial relationships to meet model evaluation needs. More importantly, we intentionally construct scenes with similar objects to a certain degree and design an LLM-VLM-cooperated annotator to capture key distinctions as annotations. The resultant benchmark can better challenge 3D models, reveal their shortcomings in understanding, and potentially aid in the further development of 3D models.</p></details> | Accepted to AAAI2025 |

The agent uses this world model to restore a shuffled scene to its original configuration, making an accurate representation of the world essential for successfully completing the task. In this work, we present a novel framework that leverages on 3D Gaussian Splatting as a 3D scene representation for experience goal visual rearrangement task. Recent advances in volumetric scene representation like 3D Gaussian Splatting, offer fast rendering of high quality and photo-realistic novel views. Our approach enables the agent to have consistent views of the current and the goal setting of the rearrangement task, which enables the agent to directly compare the goal state and the shuffled state of the world in image space. To compare these views, we propose to use a dense feature matching method with visual features extracted from a foundation model, leveraging its advantages of a more universal feature representation, which facilitates robustness, and generalization. We validate our approach on the AI2-THOR rearrangement challenge benchmark and demonstrate improvements over the current state of the art methods</p></details> |  |

However, current mainstream navigation strategies that leverage such incomplete maps as workspace prior knowledge often fail in modern long-term autonomy long-distance travel scenarios where map accumulation errors become significant. To address these limitations of map-based navigation, this paper is the first to explore mapless navigation in the embodied AI field, in particular, to utilize object-goal navigation (commonly abbreviated as ON, ObjNav, or OGN) techniques that efficiently explore target objects without using such a prior map. Specifically, in this work, we start from an off-the-shelf mapless ON planner, extend it to utilize a prior map, and further show that the performance in long-distance ALC (LD-ALC) can be maximized by minimizing ``ALC loss" and ``ON loss". This study highlights a simple and effective approach, called ALC-ON (ALCON), to accelerate the progress of challenging long-distance ALC technology by leveraging the growing frontier-guided, data-driven, and LLM-guided ON technologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Draft...</summary><p>Draft version of a conference paper with 7 pages, 5 figures, and 1 table</p></details> |

Existing representations, such as object-centric 3D scene graphs, oversimplify spatial relationships by modeling scenes as isolated objects with restrictive textual relationships, making it difficult to address queries requiring nuanced spatial understanding. Moreover, these representations lack natural mechanisms for active exploration and memory management, hindering their application to lifelong autonomy. In this work, we propose 3D-Mem, a novel 3D scene memory framework for embodied agents. 3D-Mem employs informative multi-view images, termed Memory Snapshots, to represent the scene and capture rich visual information of explored regions. It further integrates frontier-based exploration by introducing Frontier Snapshots-glimpses of unexplored areas-enabling agents to make informed decisions by considering both known and potential new information. To support lifelong memory in active exploration settings, we present an incremental construction pipeline for 3D-Mem, as well as a memory retrieval technique for memory management. Experimental results on three benchmarks demonstrate that 3D-Mem significantly enhances agents' exploration and reasoning capabilities in 3D environments, highlighting its potential for advancing applications in embodied AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Grasp What You Want: Embodied Dexterous Grasping System Driven by Your Voice](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10694v1)** | 2024-12-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, as robotics has advanced, human-robot collaboration has gained increasing importance. However, current robots struggle to fully and accurately interpret human intentions from voice commands alone. Traditional gripper and suction systems often fail to interact naturally with humans, lack advanced manipulation capabilities, and are not adaptable to diverse tasks, especially in unstructured environments. This paper introduces the Embodied Dexterous Grasping System (EDGS), designed to tackle object grasping in cluttered environments for human-robot interaction. We propose a novel approach to semantic-object alignment using a Vision-Language Model (VLM) that fuses voice commands and visual information, significantly enhancing the alignment of multi-dimensional attributes of target objects in complex scenarios. Inspired by human hand-object interactions, we develop a robust, precise, and efficient grasping strategy, incorporating principles like the thumb-object axis, multi-finger wrapping, and fingertip interaction with an object's contact mechanics. We also design experiments to assess Referring Expression Representation Enrichment (RERE) in referring expression segmentation, demonstrating that our system accurately detects and matches referring expressions. Extensive experiments confirm that EDGS can effectively handle complex grasping tasks, achieving stability and high success rates, highlighting its potential for further development in the field of Embodied AI.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce a Self-Refining Data Flywheel (SRDF) that generates high-quality and large-scale navigational instruction-trajectory pairs by iteratively refining the data pool through the collaboration between two models, the instruction generator and the navigator, without any human-in-the-loop annotation. Specifically, SRDF starts with using a base generator to create an initial data pool for training a base navigator, followed by applying the trained navigator to filter the data pool. This leads to higher-fidelity data to train a better generator, which can, in turn, produce higher-quality data for training the next-round navigator. Such a flywheel establishes a data self-refining process, yielding a continuously improved and highly effective dataset for large-scale language-guided navigation learning. Our experiments demonstrate that after several flywheel rounds, the navigator elevates the performance boundary from 70% to 78% SPL on the classic R2R test set, surpassing human performance (76%) for the first time. Meanwhile, this process results in a superior generator, evidenced by a SPICE increase from 23.5 to 26.2, better than all previous VLN instruction generation methods. Finally, we demonstrate the scalability of our method through increasing environment and instruction diversity, and the generalization ability of our pre-trained navigator across various downstream navigation tasks, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin in all cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, Code and data are available at https://github.com/wz0919/VLN-SRDF</p></details> |

Specifically, our focus lies in areas such as Embodied AI, Games, UI Control, and Planning. To this end, we introduce a process of adapting an MLLM to a Generalist Embodied Agent (GEA). GEA is a single unified model capable of grounding itself across these varied domains through a multi-embodiment action tokenizer. GEA is trained with supervised learning on a large dataset of embodied experiences and with online RL in interactive simulators. We explore the data and algorithmic choices necessary to develop such a model. Our findings reveal the importance of training with cross-domain data and online RL for building generalist agents. The final GEA model achieves strong generalization performance to unseen tasks across diverse benchmarks compared to other generalist models and benchmark-specific approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[CogNav: Cognitive Process Modeling for Object Goal Navigation with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10439v1)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object goal navigation (ObjectNav) is a fundamental task of embodied AI that requires the agent to find a target object in unseen environments. This task is particularly challenging as it demands both perceptual and cognitive processes for effective perception and decision-making. While perception has gained significant progress powered by the rapidly developed visual foundation models, the progress on the cognitive side remains limited to either implicitly learning from massive navigation demonstrations or explicitly leveraging pre-defined heuristic rules. Inspired by neuroscientific evidence that humans consistently update their cognitive states while searching for objects in unseen environments, we present CogNav, which attempts to model this cognitive process with the help of large language models. Specifically, we model the cognitive process with a finite state machine composed of cognitive states ranging from exploration to identification. The transitions between the states are determined by a large language model based on an online built heterogeneous cognitive map containing spatial and semantic information of the scene being explored. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world environments demonstrate that our cognitive modeling significantly improves ObjectNav efficiency, with human-like navigation behaviors. In an open-vocabulary and zero-shot setting, our method advances the SOTA of the HM3D benchmark from 69.3% to 87.2%. The code and data will be released.</p></details> |  |

The central case study is Jess+ an intelligent digital score system for shared creativity with a mixed ensemble of non-disabled and disabled musicians. The overarching aim is that the digital score enables disabled musicians to thrive in a live music conversation with other musicians regardless of the potential barriers of disability and music-making. After defining what we mean by embodied AI and how this approach supports the aims of the Jess+ project, we outline the main design features of the system. This includes several novel approaches such as its modular design, an AI Factory based on an embodied musicking dataset, and an embedded belief system. Our findings showed that the implemented design decisions and embodied-AI approach led to rich experiences for the musicians which in turn transformed their practice as an inclusive ensemble.</p></details> |  |
| **[Grounding Multimodal Large Language Models in Actions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07904v2)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated a wide range of capabilities across many domains, including Embodied AI. In this work, we study how to best ground a MLLM into different embodiments and their associated action spaces, with the goal of leveraging the multimodal world knowledge of the MLLM. We first generalize a number of methods through a unified architecture and the lens of action space adaptors. For continuous actions, we show that a learned tokenization allows for sufficient modeling precision, yielding the best performance on downstream tasks. For discrete actions, we demonstrate that semantically aligning these actions with the native output token space of the MLLM leads to the strongest performance. We arrive at these lessons via a thorough study of seven action space adapters on five different environments, encompassing over 114 embodied tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, previous work has been scattered across diverse simulation platforms, with assets and models lacking unified interfaces, which has led to inefficiencies in research. To address this, we introduce InfiniteWorld, a unified and scalable simulator for general vision-language robot interaction built on Nvidia Isaac Sim. InfiniteWorld encompasses a comprehensive set of physics asset construction methods and generalized free robot interaction benchmarks. Specifically, we first built a unified and scalable simulation framework for embodied learning that integrates a series of improvements in generation-driven 3D asset construction, Real2Sim, automated annotation framework, and unified 3D asset processing. This framework provides a unified and scalable platform for robot interaction and learning. In addition, to simulate realistic robot interaction, we build four new general benchmarks, including scene graph collaborative exploration and open-world social mobile manipulation. The former is often overlooked as an important task for robots to explore the environment and build scene knowledge, while the latter simulates robot interaction tasks with different levels of knowledge agents based on the former. They can more comprehensively evaluate the embodied agent's capabilities in environmental understanding, task planning and execution, and intelligent interaction. We hope that this work can provide the community with a systematic asset interface, alleviate the dilemma of the lack of high-quality assets, and provide a more comprehensive evaluation of robot interactions.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

This study finds that state-of-the-art embodied AI agents compete for higher navigation quality, but often compromise the computational efficiency. To address this issue, we introduce "Skip-SCAR," an optimization framework that builds computationally and memory-efficient embodied AI agents to accomplish high-quality visual navigation tasks. Skip-SCAR opportunistically skips the redundant step computations during semantic segmentation and local re-planning without hurting the navigation quality. Skip-SCAR also adopts a novel hybrid sparse and dense network for object prediction, optimizing both the computation and memory footprint. Tested on the HM3D ObjectNav datasets and real-world physical hardware systems, Skip-SCAR not only minimizes hardware resources but also sets new performance benchmarks, demonstrating the benefits of optimizing both navigation quality and computational efficiency for robotics.</p></details> | 7 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Privacy Risks in Reinforcement Learning for Household Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09273v3)** | 2024-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The prominence of embodied Artificial Intelligence (AI), which empowers robots to navigate, perceive, and engage within virtual environments, has attracted significant attention, owing to the remarkable advances in computer vision and large language models. Privacy emerges as a pivotal concern within the realm of embodied AI, as the robot accesses substantial personal information. However, the issue of privacy leakage in embodied AI tasks, particularly concerning reinforcement learning algorithms, has not received adequate consideration in research. This paper aims to address this gap by proposing an attack on the training process of the value-based algorithm and the gradient-based algorithm, utilizing gradient inversion to reconstruct states, actions, and supervisory signals. The choice of using gradients for the attack is motivated by the fact that commonly employed federated learning techniques solely utilize gradients computed based on private user data to optimize models, without storing or transmitting the data to public servers. Nevertheless, these gradients contain sufficient information to potentially expose private data. To validate our approach, we conducted experiments on the AI2THOR simulator and evaluated our algorithm on active perception, a prevalent task in embodied AI. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in successfully reconstructing all information from the data in 120 room layouts.

In this paper, we propose TANGO, an approach that extends the program composition via LLMs already observed for images, aiming to integrate those capabilities into embodied agents capable of observing and acting in the world. Specifically, by employing a simple PointGoal Navigation model combined with a memory-based exploration policy as a foundational primitive for guiding an agent through the world, we show how a single model can address diverse tasks without additional training. We task an LLM with composing the provided primitives to solve a specific task, using only a few in-context examples in the prompt. We evaluate our approach on three key Embodied AI tasks: Open-Set ObjectGoal Navigation, Multi-Modal Lifelong Navigation, and Open Embodied Question Answering, achieving state-of-the-art results without any specific fine-tuning in challenging zero-shot scenarios.</p></details> |  |

The system leverages multiple RGB-D cameras and a HoloLens headset for data collection, avoiding the use of expensive 3D scanners or mocap systems. We propose a semi-automatic method for annotating the shape and pose of hands and objects in the collected videos, significantly reducing the annotation time compared to manual labeling. With this system, we captured a video dataset of humans interacting with objects to perform various tasks, including simple pick-and-place actions, handovers between hands, and using objects according to their affordance, which can serve as human demonstrations for research in embodied AI and robot manipulation. Our data capture setup and annotation framework will be available for the community to use in reconstructing 3D shapes of objects and human hands and tracking their poses in videos.</p></details> |  |
| **[Functionality understanding and segmentation in 3D scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16310v3)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding functionalities in 3D scenes involves interpreting natural language descriptions to locate functional interactive objects, such as handles and buttons, in a 3D environment. Functionality understanding is highly challenging, as it requires both world knowledge to interpret language and spatial perception to identify fine-grained objects. For example, given a task like 'turn on the ceiling light', an embodied AI agent must infer that it needs to locate the light switch, even though the switch is not explicitly mentioned in the task description. To date, no dedicated methods have been developed for this problem. In this paper, we introduce Fun3DU, the first approach designed for functionality understanding in 3D scenes. Fun3DU uses a language model to parse the task description through Chain-of-Thought reasoning in order to identify the object of interest. The identified object is segmented across multiple views of the captured scene by using a vision and language model. The segmentation results from each view are lifted in 3D and aggregated into the point cloud using geometric information. Fun3DU is training-free, relying entirely on pre-trained models. We evaluate Fun3DU on SceneFun3D, the most recent and only dataset to benchmark this task, which comprises over 3000 task descriptions on 230 scenes. Our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art open-vocabulary 3D segmentation approaches.

Despite recent advancements in Neural Implicit Representations (NIR), existing methods often lack editability and compositional flexibility, limiting their use in scenarios requiring high interactivity and object-level manipulation. In this paper, we introduce the Gaussian Object Carver (GOC), a novel, efficient, and scalable framework for object-compositional 3D scene reconstruction. GOC leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS), enriched with monocular geometry priors and multi-view geometry regularization, to achieve high-quality and flexible reconstruction. Furthermore, we propose a zero-shot Object Surface Completion (OSC) model, which uses 3D priors from 3d object data to reconstruct unobserved surfaces, ensuring object completeness even in occluded areas. Experimental results demonstrate that GOC improves reconstruction efficiency and geometric fidelity. It holds promise for advancing the practical application of digital twins in embodied AI, AR/VR, and interactive simulation environments.</p></details> |  |

Many LLM-based planners are inefficient due to their large number of parameters and prone to inaccuracies because they operate in open-loop systems. We think the reason is that only applying LLMs as planners is insufficient. In this work, we propose DaDu-E, a robust closed-loop planning framework for embodied AI robots. Specifically, DaDu-E is equipped with a relatively lightweight LLM, a set of encapsulated robot skill instructions, a robust feedback system, and memory augmentation. Together, these components enable DaDu-E to (i) actively perceive and adapt to dynamic environments, (ii) optimize computational costs while maintaining high performance, and (iii) recover from execution failures using its memory and feedback mechanisms. Extensive experiments on real-world and simulated tasks show that DaDu-E achieves task success rates comparable to embodied AI robots with larger models as planners like COME-Robot, while reducing computational requirements by $6.6 \times$.

Providing a solution to these applications requires a multifaceted approach that covers scene-centric, object-centric, as well as interaction-centric capabilities. While there exist numerous datasets approaching the former two problems, the task of understanding interactable and articulated objects is underrepresented and only partly covered by current works. In this work, we address this shortcoming and introduce (1) an expertly curated dataset in the Universal Scene Description (USD) format, featuring high-quality manual annotations, for instance, segmentation and articulation on 280 indoor scenes; (2) a learning-based model together with a novel baseline capable of predicting part segmentation along with a full specification of motion attributes, including motion type, articulated and interactable parts, and motion parameters; (3) a benchmark serving to compare upcoming methods for the task at hand. Overall, our dataset provides 8 types of annotations - object and part segmentations, motion types, movable and interactable parts, motion parameters, connectivity, and object mass annotations. With its broad and high-quality annotations, the data provides the basis for holistic 3D scene understanding models. All data is provided in the USD format, allowing interoperability and easy integration with downstream tasks.

| **[LSceneLLM: Enhancing Large 3D Scene Understanding Using Adaptive Visual Preferences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01292v1)** | 2024-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Research on 3D Vision-Language Models (3D-VLMs) is gaining increasing attention, which is crucial for developing embodied AI within 3D scenes, such as visual navigation and embodied question answering. Due to the high density of visual features, especially in large 3D scenes, accurately locating task-relevant visual information is challenging. Existing works attempt to segment all objects and consider their features as scene representations. However, these task-agnostic object features include much redundant information and missing details for the task-relevant area. To tackle these problems, we propose LSceneLLM, an adaptive framework that automatically identifies task-relevant areas by leveraging LLM's visual preference for different tasks, followed by a plug-and-play scene magnifier module to capture fine-grained details in focused areas. Specifically, a dense token selector examines the attention map of LLM to identify visual preferences for the instruction input. It then magnifies fine-grained details of the focusing area. An adaptive self-attention module is leveraged to fuse the coarse-grained and selected fine-grained visual information. To comprehensively evaluate the large scene understanding ability of 3D-VLMs, we further introduce a cross-room understanding benchmark, XR-Scene, which contains a series of large scene understanding tasks including XR-QA, XR-EmbodiedPlanning, and XR-SceneCaption. Experiments show that our method surpasses existing methods on both large scene understanding and existing scene understanding benchmarks. Plunging our scene magnifier module into the existing 3D-VLMs also brings significant improvement.</p></details> |  |

Generalizing ObjectNav to Dynamic Environments with Portable Targets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09905v2)** | 2024-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>ObjectNav is a popular task in Embodied AI, where an agent navigates to a target object in an unseen environment. Prior literature makes the assumption of a static environment with stationary objects, which lacks realism. To address this, we present a novel formulation to generalize ObjectNav to dynamic environments with non-stationary objects, and refer to it as Portable ObjectNav or P-ObjectNav. In our formulation, we first address several challenging issues with dynamizing existing topological scene graphs by developing a novel method that introduces multiple transition behaviors to portable objects in the scene. We use this technique to dynamize Matterport3D, a popular simulator for evaluating embodied tasks. We then present a benchmark for P-ObjectNav using a combination of heuristic, reinforcement learning, and Large Language Model (LLM)-based navigation approaches on the dynamized environment, while introducing novel evaluation metrics tailored for our task. Our work fundamentally challenges the "static-environment" notion of prior ObjectNav work; the code and dataset for P-ObjectNav will be made publicly available to foster research on embodied navigation in dynamic scenes. We provide an anonymized repository for our code and dataset: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/PObjectNav-1C6D.</p></details> | 19 |

However, popular approaches such as reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) break down the task into successive stages, such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reward modeling (RM), and reinforcement learning (RL), each performing one specific learning task. Such a sequential approach results in serious issues such as significant under-utilization of data and distribution mismatch between the learned reward model and generated policy, which eventually lead to poor alignment performance. We develop a single stage approach named Alignment with Integrated Human Feedback (AIHF), capable of integrating both human preference and demonstration to train reward models and the policy. The proposed approach admits a suite of efficient algorithms, which can easily reduce to, and leverage, popular alignment algorithms such as RLHF and Directly Policy Optimization (DPO), and only requires minor changes to the existing alignment pipelines. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed solutions with extensive experiments involving alignment problems in LLMs and robotic control problems in MuJoCo. We observe that the proposed solutions outperform the existing alignment algorithms such as RLHF and DPO by large margins, especially when the amount of high-quality preference data is relatively limited.</p></details> |  |

The emergence of foundation models as the "brain" of EAI agents for high-level task planning has shown promising results. However, the deployment of these agents in physical environments presents significant safety challenges. For instance, a housekeeping robot lacking sufficient risk awareness might place a metal container in a microwave, potentially causing a fire. To address these critical safety concerns, comprehensive pre-deployment risk assessments are imperative. This study introduces EARBench, a novel framework for automated physical risk assessment in EAI scenarios. EAIRiskBench employs a multi-agent cooperative system that leverages various foundation models to generate safety guidelines, create risk-prone scenarios, make task planning, and evaluate safety systematically. Utilizing this framework, we construct EARDataset, comprising diverse test cases across various domains, encompassing both textual and visual scenarios. Our comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art foundation models reveals alarming results: all models exhibit high task risk rates (TRR), with an average of 95.75% across all evaluated models. To address these challenges, we further propose two prompting-based risk mitigation strategies. While these strategies demonstrate some efficacy in reducing TRR, the improvements are limited, still indicating substantial safety concerns. This study provides the first large-scale assessment of physical risk awareness in EAI agents. Our findings underscore the critical need for enhanced safety measures in EAI systems and provide valuable insights for future research directions in developing safer embodied artificial intelligence system.

However, when powered with open large language models (LLMs), these agents often struggle with rudimentary tasks, even when fine-tuned on domain-specific knowledge. Inspired by human cultural learning, we present \collabvoyager, a novel framework that enhances Voyager with lifelong collaborative learning through explicit perspective-taking. \collabvoyager introduces three key innovations: (1) theory of mind representations linking percepts, beliefs, desires, and actions; (2) natural language communication between agents; and (3) semantic memory of task and environment knowledge and episodic memory of collaboration episodes. These advancements enable agents to reason about their and others' mental states, empirically addressing two prevalent failure modes: false beliefs and faulty task executions. In mixed-expertise Minecraft experiments, \collabvoyager agents outperform Voyager counterparts, significantly improving task completion rate by $66.6\% (+39.4\%)$ for collecting one block of dirt and $70.8\% (+20.8\%)$ for collecting one wood block. They exhibit emergent behaviors like knowledge transfer from expert to novice agents and collaborative code correction. \collabvoyager agents also demonstrate the ability to adapt to out-of-distribution tasks by using their previous experiences and beliefs obtained through collaboration. In this open-ended social learning paradigm, \collabvoyager paves the way for the democratic development of embodied AI, where agents learn in deployment from both peer and environmental feedback.</p></details> |  |
| **[AVID: Adapting Video Diffusion Models to World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12822v2)** | 2024-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale generative models have achieved remarkable success in a number of domains. However, for sequential decision-making problems, such as robotics, action-labelled data is often scarce and therefore scaling-up foundation models for decision-making remains a challenge. A potential solution lies in leveraging widely-available unlabelled videos to train world models that simulate the consequences of actions. If the world model is accurate, it can be used to optimize decision-making in downstream tasks. Image-to-video diffusion models are already capable of generating highly realistic synthetic videos. However, these models are not action-conditioned, and the most powerful models are closed-source which means they cannot be finetuned. In this work, we propose to adapt pretrained video diffusion models to action-conditioned world models, without access to the parameters of the pretrained model. Our approach, AVID, trains an adapter on a small domain-specific dataset of action-labelled videos. AVID uses a learned mask to modify the intermediate outputs of the pretrained model and generate accurate action-conditioned videos.

In this study, we introduce ROOT, a VLM-based system designed to enhance the analysis of indoor scenes. Specifically, we first develop an iterative object perception algorithm using GPT-4V to detect object entities within indoor scenes. This is followed by employing vision foundation models to acquire additional meta-information about the scene, such as bounding boxes. Building on this foundational data, we propose a specialized VLM, SceneVLM, which is capable of generating spatial hierarchical scene graphs and providing distance information for objects within indoor environments. This information enhances our understanding of the spatial arrangement of indoor scenes. To train our SceneVLM, we collect over 610,000 images from various public indoor datasets and implement a scene data generation pipeline with a semi-automated technique to establish relationships and estimate distances among indoor objects. By utilizing this enriched data, we conduct various training recipes and finish SceneVLM. Our experiments demonstrate that \rootname facilitates indoor scene understanding and proves effective in diverse downstream applications, such as 3D scene generation and embodied AI. The code will be released at \url{https://github.com/harrytea/ROOT}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal 3D Reasoning Segmentation with Complex Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13927v1)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent development in multimodal learning has greatly advanced the research in 3D scene understanding in various real-world tasks such as embodied AI. However, most existing work shares two typical constraints: 1) they are short of reasoning ability for interaction and interpretation of human intension and 2) they focus on scenarios with single-category objects only which leads to over-simplified textual descriptions due to the negligence of multi-object scenarios and spatial relations among objects. We bridge the research gaps by proposing a 3D reasoning segmentation task for multiple objects in scenes. The task allows producing 3D segmentation masks and detailed textual explanations as enriched by 3D spatial relations among objects. To this end, we create ReasonSeg3D, a large-scale and high-quality benchmark that integrates 3D spatial relations with generated question-answer pairs and 3D segmentation masks. In addition, we design MORE3D, a simple yet effective method that enables multi-object 3D reasoning segmentation with user questions and textual outputs. Extensive experiments show that MORE3D excels in reasoning and segmenting complex multi-object 3D scenes, and the created ReasonSeg3D offers a valuable platform for future exploration of 3D reasoning segmentation. The dataset and code will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative World Explorer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11844v2)** | 2024-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Planning with partial observation is a central challenge in embodied AI. A majority of prior works have tackled this challenge by developing agents that physically explore their environment to update their beliefs about the world state. In contrast, humans can $\textit{imagine}$ unseen parts of the world through a mental exploration and $\textit{revise}$ their beliefs with imagined observations. Such updated beliefs can allow them to make more informed decisions, without necessitating the physical exploration of the world at all times. To achieve this human-like ability, we introduce the $\textit{Generative World Explorer (Genex)}$, an egocentric world exploration framework that allows an agent to mentally explore a large-scale 3D world (e.g., urban scenes) and acquire imagined observations to update its belief. This updated belief will then help the agent to make a more informed decision at the current step. To train $\textit{Genex}$, we create a synthetic urban scene dataset, Genex-DB. Our experimental results demonstrate that (1) $\textit{Genex}$ can generate high-quality and consistent observations during long-horizon exploration of a large virtual physical world and (2) the beliefs updated with the generated observations can inform an existing decision-making model (e.g., an LLM agent) to make better plans.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: generative-world-explorer.github.io</p></details> |

However, existing datasets and benchmarks for situated understanding are limited in data modality, diversity, scale, and task scope. To address these limitations, we propose Multi-modal Situated Question Answering (MSQA), a large-scale multi-modal situated reasoning dataset, scalably collected leveraging 3D scene graphs and vision-language models (VLMs) across a diverse range of real-world 3D scenes. MSQA includes 251K situated question-answering pairs across 9 distinct question categories, covering complex scenarios within 3D scenes. We introduce a novel interleaved multi-modal input setting in our benchmark to provide text, image, and point cloud for situation and question description, resolving ambiguity in previous single-modality convention (e.g., text). Additionally, we devise the Multi-modal Situated Next-step Navigation (MSNN) benchmark to evaluate models' situated reasoning for navigation. Comprehensive evaluations on MSQA and MSNN highlight the limitations of existing vision-language models and underscore the importance of handling multi-modal interleaved inputs and situation modeling. Experiments on data scaling and cross-domain transfer further demonstrate the efficacy of leveraging MSQA as a pre-training dataset for developing more powerful situated reasoning models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024 Datasets and Benchmarks Track.

| **[Software-Hardware Co-Design For Embodied AI Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04292v4)** | 2024-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI robots have the potential to fundamentally improve the way human beings live and manufacture. Continued progress in the burgeoning field of using large language models to control robots depends critically on an efficient computing substrate. In particular, today's computing systems for embodied AI robots are designed purely based on the interest of algorithm developers, where robot actions are divided into a discrete frame-basis. Such an execution pipeline creates high latency and energy consumption. This paper proposes Corki, an algorithm-architecture co-design framework for real-time embodied AI robot control. Our idea is to decouple LLM inference, robotic control and data communication in the embodied AI robots compute pipeline. Instead of predicting action for one single frame, Corki predicts the trajectory for the near future to reduce the frequency of LLM inference. The algorithm is coupled with a hardware that accelerates transforming trajectory into actual torque signals used to control robots and an execution pipeline that parallels data communication with computation. Corki largely reduces LLM inference frequency by up to 8.0x, resulting in up to 3.6x speed up. The success rate improvement can be up to 17.3%. Code is provided for re-implementation. https://github.com/hyy0613/Corki</p></details> |  |

Generated models frequently fail to maintain balance when placed in physics-based simulations or 3D printed. This balance is crucial for satisfying user design intentions in interactive gaming, embodied AI, and robotics, where stable models are needed for reliable interaction. Additionally, stable models ensure that 3D-printed objects, such as figurines for home decoration, can stand on their own without requiring additional supports. To fill this gap, we introduce Atlas3D, an automatic and easy-to-implement method that enhances existing Score Distillation Sampling (SDS)-based text-to-3D tools. Atlas3D ensures the generation of self-supporting 3D models that adhere to physical laws of stability under gravity, contact, and friction. Our approach combines a novel differentiable simulation-based loss function with physically inspired regularization, serving as either a refinement or a post-processing module for existing frameworks. We verify Atlas3D's efficacy through extensive generation tasks and validate the resulting 3D models in both simulated and real-world environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://yunuoch.github.io/Atlas3D/</p></details> |
| **[Architect: Generating Vivid and Interactive 3D Scenes with Hierarchical 2D Inpainting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09823v1)** | 2024-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Creating large-scale interactive 3D environments is essential for the development of Robotics and Embodied AI research. Current methods, including manual design, procedural generation, diffusion-based scene generation, and large language model (LLM) guided scene design, are hindered by limitations such as excessive human effort, reliance on predefined rules or training datasets, and limited 3D spatial reasoning ability. Since pre-trained 2D image generative models better capture scene and object configuration than LLMs, we address these challenges by introducing Architect, a generative framework that creates complex and realistic 3D embodied environments leveraging diffusion-based 2D image inpainting. In detail, we utilize foundation visual perception models to obtain each generated object from the image and leverage pre-trained depth estimation models to lift the generated 2D image to 3D space. Our pipeline is further extended to a hierarchical and iterative inpainting process to continuously generate placement of large furniture and small objects to enrich the scene. This iterative structure brings the flexibility for our method to generate or refine scenes from various starting points, such as text, floor plans, or pre-arranged environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Autoregressive Models in Vision: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05902v1)** | 2024-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive modeling has been a huge success in the field of natural language processing (NLP). Recently, autoregressive models have emerged as a significant area of focus in computer vision, where they excel in producing high-quality visual content. Autoregressive models in NLP typically operate on subword tokens. However, the representation strategy in computer vision can vary in different levels, \textit{i.e.}, pixel-level, token-level, or scale-level, reflecting the diverse and hierarchical nature of visual data compared to the sequential structure of language. This survey comprehensively examines the literature on autoregressive models applied to vision. To improve readability for researchers from diverse research backgrounds, we start with preliminary sequence representation and modeling in vision. Next, we divide the fundamental frameworks of visual autoregressive models into three general sub-categories, including pixel-based, token-based, and scale-based models based on the strategy of representation. We then explore the interconnections between autoregressive models and other generative models. Furthermore, we present a multi-faceted categorization of autoregressive models in computer vision, including image generation, video generation, 3D generation, and multi-modal generation. We also elaborate on their applications in diverse domains, including emerging domains such as embodied AI and 3D medical AI, with about 250 related references. Finally, we highlight the current challenges to autoregressive models in vision with suggestions about potential research directions. We have also set up a Github repository to organize the papers included in this survey at: \url{https://github.com/ChaofanTao/Autoregressive-Models-in-Vision-Survey}.</p></details> |  |
| **["Where am I?" Scene Retrieval with Language](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14565v2)** | 2024-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural language interfaces to embodied AI are becoming more ubiquitous in our daily lives. This opens up further opportunities for language-based interaction with embodied agents, such as a user verbally instructing an agent to execute some task in a specific location. For example, "put the bowls back in the cupboard next to the fridge" or "meet me at the intersection under the red sign." As such, we need methods that interface between natural language and map representations of the environment. To this end, we explore the question of whether we can use an open-set natural language query to identify a scene represented by a 3D scene graph. We define this task as "language-based scene-retrieval" and it is closely related to "coarse-localization," but we are instead searching for a match from a collection of disjoint scenes and not necessarily a large-scale continuous map. We present Text2SceneGraphMatcher, a "scene-retrieval" pipeline that learns joint embeddings between text descriptions and scene graphs to determine if they are a match. The code, trained models, and datasets will be made public.</p></details> |  |

Despite advancements in motion quality and physical plausibility, two pivotal factors, versatile interaction control and the development of a user-friendly interface, require further exploration before the practical application of HSI. This paper presents a unified HSI framework, UniHSI, which supports unified control of diverse interactions through language commands. This framework is built upon the definition of interaction as Chain of Contacts (CoC): steps of human joint-object part pairs, which is inspired by the strong correlation between interaction types and human-object contact regions. Based on the definition, UniHSI constitutes a Large Language Model (LLM) Planner to translate language prompts into task plans in the form of CoC, and a Unified Controller that turns CoC into uniform task execution. To facilitate training and evaluation, we collect a new dataset named ScenePlan that encompasses thousands of task plans generated by LLMs based on diverse scenarios. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in versatile task execution and generalizability to real scanned scenes.

| **[3D Audio-Visual Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02236v1)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recognizing the sounding objects in scenes is a longstanding objective in embodied AI, with diverse applications in robotics and AR/VR/MR. To that end, Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS), taking as condition an audio signal to identify the masks of the target sounding objects in an input image with synchronous camera and microphone sensors, has been recently advanced. However, this paradigm is still insufficient for real-world operation, as the mapping from 2D images to 3D scenes is missing. To address this fundamental limitation, we introduce a novel research problem, 3D Audio-Visual Segmentation, extending the existing AVS to the 3D output space. This problem poses more challenges due to variations in camera extrinsics, audio scattering, occlusions, and diverse acoustics across sounding object categories. To facilitate this research, we create the very first simulation based benchmark, 3DAVS-S34-O7, providing photorealistic 3D scene environments with grounded spatial audio under single-instance and multi-instance settings, across 34 scenes and 7 object categories. This is made possible by re-purposing the Habitat simulator to generate comprehensive annotations of sounding object locations and corresponding 3D masks. Subsequently, we propose a new approach, EchoSegnet, characterized by integrating the ready-to-use knowledge from pretrained 2D audio-visual foundation models synergistically with 3D visual scene representation through spatial audio-aware mask alignment and refinement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EchoSegnet can effectively segment sounding objects in 3D space on our new benchmark, representing a significant advancement in the field of embodied AI.

However, current VLN frameworks often rely on static environments and optimal expert supervision, limiting their real-world applicability. To address this, we introduce Human-Aware Vision-and-Language Navigation (HA-VLN), extending traditional VLN by incorporating dynamic human activities and relaxing key assumptions. We propose the Human-Aware 3D (HA3D) simulator, which combines dynamic human activities with the Matterport3D dataset, and the Human-Aware Room-to-Room (HA-R2R) dataset, extending R2R with human activity descriptions. To tackle HA-VLN challenges, we present the Expert-Supervised Cross-Modal (VLN-CM) and Non-Expert-Supervised Decision Transformer (VLN-DT) agents, utilizing cross-modal fusion and diverse training strategies for effective navigation in dynamic human environments. A comprehensive evaluation, including metrics considering human activities, and systematic analysis of HA-VLN's unique challenges, underscores the need for further research to enhance HA-VLN agents' real-world robustness and adaptability. Ultimately, this work provides benchmarks and insights for future research on embodied AI and Sim2Real transfer, paving the way for more realistic and applicable VLN systems in human-populated environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Spotl...</summary><p>Spotlight at NeurIPS 2024 D&B Track. 32 pages, 18 figures, Project Page: https://lpercc.github.io/HA3D_simulator/</p></details> |

Our system is modular: it deploys state of the art Large Language Models for task planning,Vision-Language models for semantic perception, and Point Cloud transformers for grasping. With semantic and physical safety in mind, these modules are interfaced with a real-time trajectory optimizer and a compliant tracking controller to enable human-robot proximity. We demonstrate performance for the following tasks: bi-arm sorting, bottle opening, and trash disposal tasks. These are done zero-shot where the models used have not been trained with any real world data from this bi-arm robot, scenes or workspace. Composing both learning- and non-learning-based components in a modular fashion with interpretable inputs and outputs allows the user to easily debug points of failures and fragilities. One may also in-place swap modules to improve the robustness of the overall platform, for instance with imitation-learned policies.

At present, many evaluation platforms with rich scenes, high visual fidelity and various application scenarios have been developed. In this paper, we present a hybrid framework named NeuronsGym that can be used for policy learning of robot tasks, covering a simulation platform for training policy, and a physical system for studying sim2real problems. Unlike most current single-task, slow-moving robotic platforms, our framework provides agile physical robots with a wider range of speeds, and can be employed to train robotic navigation and confrontation policies. At the same time, in order to evaluate the safety of robot navigation, we propose a safety-weighted path length (SFPL) to improve the safety evaluation in the current mobile robot navigation. Based on this platform, we build a new benchmark for navigation and confrontation tasks under this platform by comparing the current mainstream sim2real methods, and hold the 2022 IEEE Conference on Games (CoG) RoboMaster sim2real challenge. We release the codes of this framework\footnote{\url{https://github.com/DRL-CASIA/NeuronsGym}} and hope that this platform can promote the development of more flexible and agile general mobile agent algorithms.</p></details> | 16 pages, 10 figures |

A promising solution is interactive imitation learning from human intervention, where a human expert observes the policy's execution and provides interventions as feedback. However, existing methods often fail to utilize the prior policy efficiently to facilitate learning, thus hindering sample efficiency. In this work, we introduce MEReQ (Maximum-Entropy Residual-Q Inverse Reinforcement Learning), designed for sample-efficient alignment from human intervention. Instead of inferring the complete human behavior characteristics, MEReQ infers a residual reward function that captures the discrepancy between the human expert's and the prior policy's underlying reward functions. It then employs Residual Q-Learning (RQL) to align the policy with human preferences using this residual reward function. Extensive evaluations on simulated and real-world tasks demonstrate that MEReQ achieves sample-efficient policy alignment from human intervention.</p></details> |  |

One notably promising application of LLM agents is robotic manipulation. Recent research has shown that LLMs can generate text planning or control code for robots, providing substantial flexibility and interaction capabilities. However, these methods still face challenges in terms of flexibility and applicability across different environments, limiting their ability to adapt autonomously. Current approaches typically fall into two categories: those relying on environment-specific policy training, which restricts their transferability, and those generating code actions based on fixed prompts, which leads to diminished performance when confronted with new environments. These limitations significantly constrain the generalizability of agents in robotic manipulation. To address these limitations, we propose a novel method called EnvBridge. This approach involves the retention and transfer of successful robot control codes from source environments to target environments. EnvBridge enhances the agent's adaptability and performance across diverse settings by leveraging insights from multiple environments. Notably, our approach alleviates environmental constraints, offering a more flexible and generalizable solution for robotic manipulation tasks. We validated the effectiveness of our method using robotic manipulation benchmarks: RLBench, MetaWorld, and CALVIN. Our experiments demonstrate that LLM agents can successfully leverage diverse knowledge sources to solve complex tasks. Consequently, our approach significantly enhances the adaptability and robustness of robotic manipulation agents in planning across diverse environments.</p></details> |  |

When integrated into an embodied agent, existing embodied VLM works either output detailed action sequences at the manipulation level or only provide plans at an abstract level, leaving a gap between high-level planning and real-world manipulation. To bridge this gap, we introduce Octopus, an embodied vision-language programmer that uses executable code generation as a medium to connect planning and manipulation. Octopus is designed to 1) proficiently comprehend an agent's visual and textual task objectives, 2) formulate intricate action sequences, and 3) generate executable code. To facilitate Octopus model development, we introduce OctoVerse: a suite of environments tailored for benchmarking vision-based code generators on a wide spectrum of tasks, ranging from mundane daily chores in simulators to sophisticated interactions in complex video games such as Grand Theft Auto (GTA) and Minecraft. To train Octopus, we leverage GPT-4 to control an explorative agent that generates training data, i.e., action blueprints and corresponding executable code. We also collect feedback that enables an enhanced training scheme called Reinforcement Learning with Environmental Feedback (RLEF). Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate Octopus's functionality and present compelling results, showing that the proposed RLEF refines the agent's decision-making. By open-sourcing our simulation environments, dataset, and model architecture, we aspire to ignite further innovation and foster collaborative applications within the broader embodied AI community.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://choiszt.github.io/Octopus/, Codebase: https://github.com/dongyh20/Octopus</p></details> |

More recently, multi-agent systems with LLM-based agents (Multi-LLM) have been utilized increasingly more for QA. In these scenarios, the models may each answer the question and reach a consensus or each model is specialized to answer different domain questions. However, most prior work dealing with Multi-LLM QA has focused on scenarios where the models are asked in a zero-shot manner or are given information sources to extract the answer. For question answering of an unknown environment, embodied exploration of the environment is first needed to answer the question. This skill is necessary for personalizing embodied AI to environments such as households. There is a lack of insight into whether a Multi-LLM system can handle question-answering based on observations from embodied exploration. In this work, we address this gap by investigating the use of Multi-Embodied LLM Explorers (MELE) for QA in an unknown environment. Multiple LLM-based agents independently explore and then answer queries about a household environment. We analyze different aggregation methods to generate a single, final answer for each query: debating, majority voting, and training a central answer module (CAM). Using CAM, we observe a $46\%$ higher accuracy compared against the other non-learning-based aggregation methods. We provide code and the query dataset for further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 9 Figures, 5 Tables</p></details> |

Through this unified latent action space, IGOR enables knowledge transfer among large-scale robot and human activity data. We achieve this by compressing visual changes between an initial image and its goal state into latent actions. IGOR allows us to generate latent action labels for internet-scale video data. This unified latent action space enables the training of foundation policy and world models across a wide variety of tasks performed by both robots and humans. We demonstrate that: (1) IGOR learns a semantically consistent action space for both human and robots, characterizing various possible motions of objects representing the physical interaction knowledge; (2) IGOR can "migrate" the movements of the object in the one video to other videos, even across human and robots, by jointly using the latent action model and world model; (3) IGOR can learn to align latent actions with natural language through the foundation policy model, and integrate latent actions with a low-level policy model to achieve effective robot control. We believe IGOR opens new possibilities for human-to-robot knowledge transfer and control.</p></details> |  |

Building on previous work, EgoThink, we introduce VidEgoThink, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating egocentric video understanding capabilities. To bridge the gap between MLLMs and low-level control in Embodied AI, we design four key interrelated tasks: video question-answering, hierarchy planning, visual grounding and reward modeling. To minimize manual annotation costs, we develop an automatic data generation pipeline based on the Ego4D dataset, leveraging the prior knowledge and multimodal capabilities of GPT-4o. Three human annotators then filter the generated data to ensure diversity and quality, resulting in the VidEgoThink benchmark. We conduct extensive experiments with three types of models: API-based MLLMs, open-source image-based MLLMs, and open-source video-based MLLMs. Experimental results indicate that all MLLMs, including GPT-4o, perform poorly across all tasks related to egocentric video understanding. These findings suggest that foundation models still require significant advancements to be effectively applied to first-person scenarios in Embodied AI.

Despite significant achievements in complex robotic locomotion and skills, mobile manipulation-a capability that requires the coordination of navigation and manipulation-remains a challenge for generative AI techniques. This is primarily due to the high-dimensional action space, extended motion trajectories, and interactions with the surrounding environment. In this paper, we introduce M2Diffuser, a diffusion-based, scene-conditioned generative model that directly generates coordinated and efficient whole-body motion trajectories for mobile manipulation based on robot-centric 3D scans. M2Diffuser first learns trajectory-level distributions from mobile manipulation trajectories provided by an expert planner. Crucially, it incorporates an optimization module that can flexibly accommodate physical constraints and task objectives, modeled as cost and energy functions, during the inference process. This enables the reduction of physical violations and execution errors at each denoising step in a fully differentiable manner. Through benchmarking on three types of mobile manipulation tasks across over 20 scenes, we demonstrate that M2Diffuser outperforms state-of-the-art neural planners and successfully transfers the generated trajectories to a real-world robot. Our evaluations underscore the potential of generative AI to enhance the generalization of traditional planning and learning-based robotic methods, while also highlighting the critical role of enforcing physical constraints for safe and robust execution.</p></details> |  |
| **[EgoChoir: Capturing 3D Human-Object Interaction Regions from Egocentric Views](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13659v2)** | 2024-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding egocentric human-object interaction (HOI) is a fundamental aspect of human-centric perception, facilitating applications like AR/VR and embodied AI. For the egocentric HOI, in addition to perceiving semantics e.g., ''what'' interaction is occurring, capturing ''where'' the interaction specifically manifests in 3D space is also crucial, which links the perception and operation. Existing methods primarily leverage observations of HOI to capture interaction regions from an exocentric view. However, incomplete observations of interacting parties in the egocentric view introduce ambiguity between visual observations and interaction contents, impairing their efficacy. From the egocentric view, humans integrate the visual cortex, cerebellum, and brain to internalize their intentions and interaction concepts of objects, allowing for the pre-formulation of interactions and making behaviors even when interaction regions are out of sight. In light of this, we propose harmonizing the visual appearance, head motion, and 3D object to excavate the object interaction concept and subject intention, jointly inferring 3D human contact and object affordance from egocentric videos. To achieve this, we present EgoChoir, which links object structures with interaction contexts inherent in appearance and head motion to reveal object affordance, further utilizing it to model human contact. Additionally, a gradient modulation is employed to adopt appropriate clues for capturing interaction regions across various egocentric scenarios. Moreover, 3D contact and affordance are annotated for egocentric videos collected from Ego-Exo4D and GIMO to support the task. Extensive experiments on them demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of EgoChoir.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS2024, project: https://yyvhang.github.io/EgoChoir/</p></details> |
| **[Scaling Instructable Agents Across Many Simulated Worlds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10179v3)** | 2024-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building embodied AI systems that can follow arbitrary language instructions in any 3D environment is a key challenge for creating general AI. Accomplishing this goal requires learning to ground language in perception and embodied actions, in order to accomplish complex tasks. The Scalable, Instructable, Multiworld Agent (SIMA) project tackles this by training agents to follow free-form instructions across a diverse range of virtual 3D environments, including curated research environments as well as open-ended, commercial video games. Our goal is to develop an instructable agent that can accomplish anything a human can do in any simulated 3D environment. Our approach focuses on language-driven generality while imposing minimal assumptions. Our agents interact with environments in real-time using a generic, human-like interface: the inputs are image observations and language instructions and the outputs are keyboard-and-mouse actions. This general approach is challenging, but it allows agents to ground language across many visually complex and semantically rich environments while also allowing us to readily run agents in new environments. In this paper we describe our motivation and goal, the initial progress we have made, and promising preliminary results on several diverse research environments and a variety of commercial video games.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in Robotics and Embodied AI make public urban spaces no longer exclusive to humans. Food delivery bots and electric wheelchairs have started sharing sidewalks with pedestrians, while robot dogs and humanoids have recently emerged in the street. Micromobility enabled by AI for short-distance travel in public urban spaces plays a crucial component in the future transportation system. Ensuring the generalizability and safety of AI models maneuvering mobile machines is essential. In this work, we present MetaUrban, a compositional simulation platform for the AI-driven urban micromobility research. MetaUrban can construct an infinite number of interactive urban scenes from compositional elements, covering a vast array of ground plans, object placements, pedestrians, vulnerable road users, and other mobile agents' appearances and dynamics. We design point navigation and social navigation tasks as the pilot study using MetaUrban for urban micromobility research and establish various baselines of Reinforcement Learning and Imitation Learning. We conduct extensive evaluation across mobile machines, demonstrating that heterogeneous mechanical structures significantly influence the learning and execution of AI policies. We perform a thorough ablation study, showing that the compositional nature of the simulated environments can substantially improve the generalizability and safety of the trained mobile agents. MetaUrban will be made publicly available to provide research opportunities and foster safe and trustworthy embodied AI and micromobility in cities. The code and dataset will be publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical report. Project page: https://metadriverse.github.io/metaurban/</p></details> |

Our approach leverages differentiable neural rendering on multi-view images to endow a vanilla Vision Transformer (ViT) with intrinsic spatial understanding. We present the most comprehensive evaluation of embodied representation learning to date, covering 268 tasks across 8 simulators with diverse policies in both single-task and language-conditioned multi-task scenarios. The results are compelling: SPA consistently outperforms more than 10 state-of-the-art representation methods, including those specifically designed for embodied AI, vision-centric tasks, and multi-modal applications, while using less training data. Furthermore, we conduct a series of real-world experiments to confirm its effectiveness in practical scenarios. These results highlight the critical role of 3D spatial awareness for embodied representation learning. Our strongest model takes more than 6000 GPU hours to train and we are committed to open-sourcing all code and model weights to foster future research in embodied representation learning.

Hand motion models with the sophistication to accurately recreate piano playing have a wide range of applications in character animation, embodied AI, biomechanics, and VR/AR. In this paper, we construct a first-of-its-kind large-scale dataset that contains approximately 10 hours of 3D hand motion and audio from 15 elite-level pianists playing 153 pieces of classical music. To capture natural performances, we designed a markerless setup in which motions are reconstructed from multi-view videos using state-of-the-art pose estimation models. The motion data is further refined via inverse kinematics using the high-resolution MIDI key-pressing data obtained from sensors in a specialized Yamaha Disklavier piano. Leveraging the collected dataset, we developed a pipeline that can synthesize physically-plausible hand motions for musical scores outside of the dataset. Our approach employs a combination of imitation learning and reinforcement learning to obtain policies for physics-based bimanual control involving the interaction between hands and piano keys. To solve the sampling efficiency problem with the large motion dataset, we use a diffusion model to generate natural reference motions, which provide high-level trajectory and fingering (finger order and placement) information. However, the generated reference motion alone does not provide sufficient accuracy for piano performance modeling. We then further augmented the data by using musical similarity to retrieve similar motions from the captured dataset to boost the precision of the RL policy. With the proposed method, our model generates natural, dexterous motions that generalize to music from outside the training dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>SIGGR...</summary><p>SIGGRAPH Asia 2024.

| **[Learning the Generalizable Manipulation Skills on Soft-body Tasks via Guided Self-attention Behavior Cloning Policy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05756v1)** | 2024-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI represents a paradigm in AI research where artificial agents are situated within and interact with physical or virtual environments. Despite the recent progress in Embodied AI, it is still very challenging to learn the generalizable manipulation skills that can handle large deformation and topological changes on soft-body objects, such as clay, water, and soil. In this work, we proposed an effective policy, namely GP2E behavior cloning policy, which can guide the agent to learn the generalizable manipulation skills from soft-body tasks, including pouring, filling, hanging, excavating, pinching, and writing. Concretely, we build our policy from three insights:(1) Extracting intricate semantic features from point cloud data and seamlessly integrating them into the robot's end-effector frame; (2) Capturing long-distance interactions in long-horizon tasks through the incorporation of our guided self-attention module; (3) Mitigating overfitting concerns and facilitating model convergence to higher accuracy levels via the introduction of our two-stage fine-tuning strategy. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by achieving the 1st prize in the soft-body track of the ManiSkill2 Challenge at the CVPR 2023 4th Embodied AI workshop. Our findings highlight the potential of our method to improve the generalization abilities of Embodied AI models and pave the way for their practical applications in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causality-Aware Transformer Networks for Robotic Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02669v2)** | 2024-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current research in Visual Navigation reveals opportunities for improvement. First, the direct adoption of RNNs and Transformers often overlooks the specific differences between Embodied AI and traditional sequential data modelling, potentially limiting its performance in Embodied AI tasks. Second, the reliance on task-specific configurations, such as pre-trained modules and dataset-specific logic, compromises the generalizability of these methods. We address these constraints by initially exploring the unique differences between Navigation tasks and other sequential data tasks through the lens of Causality, presenting a causal framework to elucidate the inadequacies of conventional sequential methods for Navigation. By leveraging this causal perspective, we propose Causality-Aware Transformer (CAT) Networks for Navigation, featuring a Causal Understanding Module to enhance the models's Environmental Understanding capability. Meanwhile, our method is devoid of task-specific inductive biases and can be trained in an End-to-End manner, which enhances the method's generalizability across various contexts. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our methodology consistently surpasses benchmark performances across a spectrum of settings, tasks and simulation environments. Extensive ablation studies reveal that the performance gains can be attributed to the Causal Understanding Module, which demonstrates effectiveness and efficiency in both Reinforcement Learning and Supervised Learning settings.</p></details> |  |

Exploring Backdoor Attacks against Embodied LLM-based Decision-Making Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20774v2)** | 2024-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant promise in real-world decision-making tasks for embodied artificial intelligence, especially when fine-tuned to leverage their inherent common sense and reasoning abilities while being tailored to specific applications. However, this fine-tuning process introduces considerable safety and security vulnerabilities, especially in safety-critical cyber-physical systems. In this work, we propose the first comprehensive framework for Backdoor Attacks against LLM-based Decision-making systems (BALD) in embodied AI, systematically exploring the attack surfaces and trigger mechanisms. Specifically, we propose three distinct attack mechanisms: word injection, scenario manipulation, and knowledge injection, targeting various components in the LLM-based decision-making pipeline. We perform extensive experiments on representative LLMs (GPT-3.5, LLaMA2, PaLM2) in autonomous driving and home robot tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness and stealthiness of our backdoor triggers across various attack channels, with cases like vehicles accelerating toward obstacles and robots placing knives on beds. Our word and knowledge injection attacks achieve nearly 100% success rate across multiple models and datasets while requiring only limited access to the system. Our scenario manipulation attack yields success rates exceeding 65%, reaching up to 90%, and does not require any runtime system intrusion. We also assess the robustness of these attacks against defenses, revealing their resilience. Our findings highlight critical security vulnerabilities in embodied LLM systems and emphasize the urgent need for safeguarding these systems to mitigate potential risks.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, including main paper, references, and appendix</p></details> |

However, there is still lack of study on how vision language models~(VLMs) behave when multi-modal task inputs are considered. Counterfactual planning that evaluates the model's reasoning ability over alternative task situations are also under exploited. In order to evaluate the planning ability of both multi-modal and counterfactual aspects, we propose ActPlan-1K. ActPlan-1K is a multi-modal planning benchmark constructed based on ChatGPT and household activity simulator iGibson2. The benchmark consists of 153 activities and 1,187 instances. Each instance describing one activity has a natural language task description and multiple environment images from the simulator. The gold plan of each instance is action sequences over the objects in provided scenes. Both the correctness and commonsense satisfaction are evaluated on typical VLMs. It turns out that current VLMs are still struggling at generating human-level procedural plans for both normal activities and counterfactual activities. We further provide automatic evaluation metrics by finetuning over BLEURT model to facilitate future research on our benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 9 figures, 8 tables, accepted to EMNLP 2024 main conference</p></details> |

With the advancement of embodied AI, robots are increasingly capable of satisfying human demands. Demand-driven navigation (DDN) is a task in which an agent must locate an object to satisfy a specified demand instruction, such as ``I am thirsty.'' The previous study typically assumes that each demand instruction requires only one object to be fulfilled and does not consider individual preferences. However, the realistic human demand may involve multiple objects. In this paper, we introduce the Multi-object Demand-driven Navigation (MO-DDN) benchmark, which addresses these nuanced aspects, including multi-object search and personal preferences, thus making the MO-DDN task more reflective of real-life scenarios compared to DDN. Building upon previous work, we employ the concept of ``attribute'' to tackle this new task. However, instead of solely relying on attribute features in an end-to-end manner like DDN, we propose a modular method that involves constructing a coarse-to-fine attribute-based exploration agent (C2FAgent). Our experimental results illustrate that this coarse-to-fine exploration strategy capitalizes on the advantages of attributes at various decision-making levels, resulting in superior performance compared to baseline methods.

For instance, a robot in an unfamiliar house initially wouldn't know the locations of objects needed for tasks and might perform inefficiently. However, as it gathers more experience, it should learn the layout of its environment and remember where objects are, allowing it to complete new tasks more efficiently. To enable such rapid adaptation to new tasks, we present ReLIC, a new approach for in-context reinforcement learning (RL) for embodied agents. With ReLIC, agents are capable of adapting to new environments using 64,000 steps of in-context experience with full attention while being trained through self-generated experience via RL. We achieve this by proposing a novel policy update scheme for on-policy RL called "partial updates'' as well as a Sink-KV mechanism that enables effective utilization of a long observation history for embodied agents. Our method outperforms a variety of meta-RL baselines in adapting to unseen houses in an embodied multi-object navigation task. In addition, we find that ReLIC is capable of few-shot imitation learning despite never being trained with expert demonstrations. We also provide a comprehensive analysis of ReLIC, highlighting that the combination of large-scale RL training, the proposed partial updates scheme, and the Sink-KV are essential for effective in-context learning. The code for ReLIC and all our experiments is at https://github.com/aielawady/relic</p></details> |  |

Large Language Model (LLM), which exhibits powerful language understanding abilities, has been extensively employed in embodied AI by facilitating sophisticated task planning. However, a critical safety issue remains overlooked: could these embodied LLMs perpetrate harmful behaviors? In response, we introduce BadRobot, a novel attack paradigm aiming to make embodied LLMs violate safety and ethical constraints through typical voice-based user-system interactions. Specifically, three vulnerabilities are exploited to achieve this type of attack: (i) manipulation of LLMs within robotic systems, (ii) misalignment between linguistic outputs and physical actions, and (iii) unintentional hazardous behaviors caused by world knowledge's flaws. Furthermore, we construct a benchmark of various malicious physical action queries to evaluate BadRobot's attack performance. Based on this benchmark, extensive experiments against existing prominent embodied LLM frameworks (e.g., Voxposer, Code as Policies, and ProgPrompt) demonstrate the effectiveness of our BadRobot. Warning: This paper contains harmful AI-generated language and aggressive actions.</p></details> | 38 pages, 16 figures |

However, real-world datasets often contain insufficient data to meet the training and evaluation requirements of models. Although synthetic datasets offer a larger volume of data, their acoustic simulations lack realism. Consequently, neither real-world nor synthetic datasets effectively fulfill practical needs. To address these issues, we introduce SonicSim, a synthetic toolkit de-designed to generate highly customizable data for moving sound sources. SonicSim is developed based on the embodied AI simulation platform, Habitat-sim, supporting multi-level adjustments, including scene-level, microphone-level, and source-level, thereby generating more diverse synthetic data. Leveraging SonicSim, we constructed a moving sound source benchmark dataset, SonicSet, using the Librispeech, the Freesound Dataset 50k (FSD50K) and Free Music Archive (FMA), and 90 scenes from the Matterport3D to evaluate speech separation and enhancement models. Additionally, to validate the differences between synthetic data and real-world data, we randomly selected 5 hours of raw data without reverberation from the SonicSet validation set to record a real-world speech separation dataset, which was then compared with the corresponding synthetic datasets. Similarly, we utilized the real-world speech enhancement dataset RealMAN to validate the acoustic gap between other synthetic datasets and the SonicSet dataset for speech enhancement. The results indicate that the synthetic data generated by SonicSim can effectively generalize to real-world scenarios. Demo and code are publicly available at https://cslikai.cn/SonicSim/.</p></details> | Technical report |

This evolution has led to the development of the Vehicular Embodied AI NETwork (VEANET), where advanced AI capabilities are integrated into vehicular systems to enhance autonomous operations and decision-making. Embodied agents, such as Autonomous Vehicles (AVs), are autonomous entities that can perceive their environment and take actions to achieve specific goals, actively interacting with the physical world. Embodied twins are digital models of these embodied agents, with various embodied AI twins for intelligent applications in cyberspace. In VEANET, embodied AI twins act as in-vehicle AI assistants to perform diverse tasks supporting autonomous driving using generative AI models. Due to limited computational resources of AVs, these AVs often offload computationally intensive tasks, such as constructing and updating embodied AI twins, to nearby RSUs. However, since the rapid mobility of AVs and the limited provision coverage of a single RSU, embodied AI twins require dynamic migrations from current RSU to other RSUs in real-time, resulting in the challenge of selecting suitable RSUs for efficient embodied AI twins migrations. Given information asymmetry, AVs cannot know the detailed information of RSUs. To this end, in this paper, we construct a multi-dimensional contract theoretical model between AVs and alternative RSUs. Considering that AVs may exhibit irrational behavior, we utilize prospect theory instead of expected utility theory to model the actual utilities of AVs. Finally, we employ a generative diffusion model-based algorithm to identify the optimal contract designs. Compared with traditional deep reinforcement learning algorithms, numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.</p></details> |  |

We also develop a means to parse human feedback expressed in natural language into local navigation waypoints and integrate it into a global planning system, by leveraging a map of semantic features and an aligned obstacle map. Extensive testing in simulation and physical hardware experiments with a resource-constrained wheeled robot tasked to navigate in a real-world environment validate the efficacy and robustness of our method. This work can support applications like precision agriculture and construction, where persistent monitoring of the environment provides a human with information about the environment state.</p></details> |  |

To address this challenge, we aim to achieve both high model performance and practical deployability. Specifically, we focus on Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN), a core task in Embodied AI. This paper introduces a two-stage knowledge distillation framework, producing a student model, MiniVLN, and showcasing the significant potential of distillation techniques in developing lightweight models. The proposed method aims to capture fine-grained knowledge during the pretraining phase and navigation-specific knowledge during the fine-tuning phase. Our findings indicate that the two-stage distillation approach is more effective in narrowing the performance gap between the teacher model and the student model compared to single-stage distillation. On the public R2R and REVERIE benchmarks, MiniVLN achieves performance on par with the teacher model while having only about 12% of the teacher model's parameter count.</p></details> |  |

While Next Best View (NBV) planning and Learning-based approaches offer solutions, they are often limited by predefined criteria and fail to manage occlusions with human-like common sense. To address these problems, we present AIR-Embodied, a novel framework that integrates embodied AI agents with large-scale pretrained multi-modal language models to improve active 3DGS reconstruction. AIR-Embodied utilizes a three-stage process: understanding the current reconstruction state via multi-modal prompts, planning tasks with viewpoint selection and interactive actions, and employing closed-loop reasoning to ensure accurate execution. The agent dynamically refines its actions based on discrepancies between the planned and actual outcomes. Experimental evaluations across virtual and real-world environments demonstrate that AIR-Embodied significantly enhances reconstruction efficiency and quality, providing a robust solution to challenges in active 3D reconstruction.</p></details> |  |

To accomplish long-horizon tasks, agents need to decompose abstract instructions into detailed steps. Prior works mostly rely on GPT-4V for task decomposition into predefined actions, which limits task diversity due to GPT-4V's finite understanding of larger skillsets. Therefore, we present ReLEP, a groundbreaking framework for Real world Long-horizon Embodied Planning, which can accomplish a wide range of daily tasks. At its core lies a fine-tuned large vision language model that formulates plans as sequences of skill functions according to input instruction and scene image. These functions are selected from a carefully designed skill library. ReLEP is also equipped with a Memory module for plan and status recall, and a Robot Configuration module for versatility across robot types. In addition, we propose a semi-automatic data generation pipeline to tackle dataset scarcity. Real-world off-line experiments across eight daily embodied tasks demonstrate that ReLEP is able to accomplish long-horizon embodied tasks and outperforms other state-of-the-art baseline methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[KARMA: Augmenting Embodied AI Agents with Long-and-short Term Memory Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14908v1)** | 2024-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI agents responsible for executing interconnected, long-sequence household tasks often face difficulties with in-context memory, leading to inefficiencies and errors in task execution. To address this issue, we introduce KARMA, an innovative memory system that integrates long-term and short-term memory modules, enhancing large language models (LLMs) for planning in embodied agents through memory-augmented prompting. KARMA distinguishes between long-term and short-term memory, with long-term memory capturing comprehensive 3D scene graphs as representations of the environment, while short-term memory dynamically records changes in objects' positions and states. This dual-memory structure allows agents to retrieve relevant past scene experiences, thereby improving the accuracy and efficiency of task planning. Short-term memory employs strategies for effective and adaptive memory replacement, ensuring the retention of critical information while discarding less pertinent data. Compared to state-of-the-art embodied agents enhanced with memory, our memory-augmented embodied AI agent improves success rates by 1.3x and 2.3x in Composite Tasks and Complex Tasks within the AI2-THOR simulator, respectively, and enhances task execution efficiency by 3.4x and 62.7x. Furthermore, we demonstrate that KARMA's plug-and-play capability allows for seamless deployment on real-world robotic systems, such as mobile manipulation platforms.Through this plug-and-play memory system, KARMA significantly enhances the ability of embodied agents to generate coherent and contextually appropriate plans, making the execution of complex household tasks more efficient.

This task introduces distinct challenges in multimodal comprehension, spatial reasoning, and decision-making. To address these challenges, we introduce Cog-GA, a generative agent founded on large language models (LLMs) tailored for VLN-CE tasks. Cog-GA employs a dual-pronged strategy to emulate human-like cognitive processes. Firstly, it constructs a cognitive map, integrating temporal, spatial, and semantic elements, thereby facilitating the development of spatial memory within LLMs. Secondly, Cog-GA employs a predictive mechanism for waypoints, strategically optimizing the exploration trajectory to maximize navigational efficiency. Each waypoint is accompanied by a dual-channel scene description, categorizing environmental cues into 'what' and 'where' streams as the brain. This segregation enhances the agent's attentional focus, enabling it to discern pertinent spatial information for navigation. A reflective mechanism complements these strategies by capturing feedback from prior navigation experiences, facilitating continual learning and adaptive replanning. Extensive evaluations conducted on VLN-CE benchmarks validate Cog-GA's state-of-the-art performance and ability to simulate human-like navigation behaviors. This research significantly contributes to the development of strategic and interpretable VLN-CE agents.</p></details> |  |

| **[P-RAG: Progressive Retrieval Augmented Generation For Planning on Embodied Everyday Task](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11279v1)** | 2024-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied Everyday Task is a popular task in the embodied AI community, requiring agents to make a sequence of actions based on natural language instructions and visual observations. Traditional learning-based approaches face two challenges. Firstly, natural language instructions often lack explicit task planning. Secondly, extensive training is required to equip models with knowledge of the task environment. Previous works based on Large Language Model (LLM) either suffer from poor performance due to the lack of task-specific knowledge or rely on ground truth as few-shot samples. To address the above limitations, we propose a novel approach called Progressive Retrieval Augmented Generation (P-RAG), which not only effectively leverages the powerful language processing capabilities of LLMs but also progressively accumulates task-specific knowledge without ground-truth. Compared to the conventional RAG methods, which retrieve relevant information from the database in a one-shot manner to assist generation, P-RAG introduces an iterative approach to progressively update the database. In each iteration, P-RAG retrieves the latest database and obtains historical information from the previous interaction as experiential references for the current interaction. Moreover, we also introduce a more granular retrieval scheme that not only retrieves similar tasks but also incorporates retrieval of similar situations to provide more valuable reference experiences. Extensive experiments reveal that P-RAG achieves competitive results without utilizing ground truth and can even further improve performance through self-iterations.</p></details> |  |

While current models show promising results, they are typically trained and tested on clean data, potentially overlooking the corruption during real-world deployment and thus posing safety risks in practical scenarios. To address this issue, we introduce PoseBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the robustness of pose estimation models against real-world corruption. We evaluated 60 representative models, including top-down, bottom-up, heatmap-based, regression-based, and classification-based methods, across three datasets for human and animal pose estimation. Our evaluation involves 10 types of corruption in four categories: 1) blur and noise, 2) compression and color loss, 3) severe lighting, and 4) masks. Our findings reveal that state-of-the-art models are vulnerable to common real-world corruptions and exhibit distinct behaviors when tackling human and animal pose estimation tasks. To improve model robustness, we delve into various design considerations, including input resolution, pre-training datasets, backbone capacity, post-processing, and data augmentations. We hope that our benchmark will serve as a foundation for advancing research in robust pose estimation.

We present a new dataset, OC-VLN, in order to distinctly evaluate grounding object-centric natural language navigation instructions in a method for performing landmark-based navigation. We also propose Natural Language grounded SLAM (NL-SLAM), a method to ground natural language instruction to robot observations and poses. We actively perform NL-SLAM in order to follow object-centric natural language navigation instructions. Our methods leverage pre-trained vision and language foundation models and require no task-specific training. We construct two strong baselines from state-of-the-art methods on related tasks, Object Goal Navigation and Vision Language Navigation, and we show that our approach, NL-SLAM, outperforms these baselines across all our metrics of success on OC-VLN. Finally, we successfully demonstrate the effectiveness of NL-SLAM for performing navigation instruction following in the real world on a Boston Dynamics Spot robot.</p></details> |  |

VLN is a challenging task that involves an agent following human instructions and navigating in a previously unknown environment to reach a specified goal. Recent work in literature focuses on different ways to augment the available datasets of instructions for improving navigation performance by exploiting synthetic training data. In this work, we propose AIGeN, a novel architecture inspired by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) that produces meaningful and well-formed synthetic instructions to improve navigation agents' performance. The model is composed of a Transformer decoder (GPT-2) and a Transformer encoder (BERT). During the training phase, the decoder generates sentences for a sequence of images describing the agent's path to a particular point while the encoder discriminates between real and fake instructions. Experimentally, we evaluate the quality of the generated instructions and perform extensive ablation studies. Additionally, we generate synthetic instructions for 217K trajectories using AIGeN on Habitat-Matterport 3D Dataset (HM3D) and show an improvement in the performance of an off-the-shelf VLN method.

But: does that noise matter? We find that nonsensical or irrelevant language instructions during pretraining can have little effect on downstream performance for both HAMT and VLN-BERT on R2R, and is still better than only using clean, human data. To underscore these results, we concoct an efficient augmentation method, Unigram + Object, which generates nonsensical instructions that nonetheless improve downstream performance. Our findings suggest that what matters for VLN R2R pretraining is the quantity of visual trajectories, not the quality of instructions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by O-DRUM @ CVPR 2023</p></details> |

While this is a trivial task for most humans, it is still an open problem for AI models. In this work, we hypothesize that poor use of the visual information available is at the core of the low performance of current models. To support this hypothesis, we provide experimental evidence showing that state-of-the-art models are not severely affected when they receive just limited or even no visual data, indicating a strong overfitting to the textual instructions. To encourage a more suitable use of the visual information, we propose a new data augmentation method that fosters the inclusion of more explicit visual information in the generation of textual navigational instructions. Our main intuition is that current VLN datasets include textual instructions that are intended to inform an expert navigator, such as a human, but not a beginner visual navigational agent, such as a randomly initialized DL model. Specifically, to bridge the visual semantic gap of current VLN datasets, we take advantage of metadata available for the Matterport3D dataset that, among others, includes information about object labels that are present in the scenes. Training a state-of-the-art model with the new set of instructions increase its performance by 8% in terms of success rate on unseen environments, demonstrating the advantages of the proposed data augmentation method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ECCV 2022.

The widespread adoption of instruction-tuned image-to-text vision-language assistants (VLAs) like LLaVA and InternVL necessitates evaluating gender biases. We study gender bias in 22 popular open-source VLAs with respect to personality traits, skills, and occupations. Our results show that VLAs replicate human biases likely present in the data, such as real-world occupational imbalances. Similarly, they tend to attribute more skills and positive personality traits to women than to men, and we see a consistent tendency to associate negative personality traits with men. To eliminate the gender bias in these models, we find that finetuning-based debiasing methods achieve the best tradeoff between debiasing and retaining performance on downstream tasks. We argue for pre-deploying gender bias assessment in VLAs and motivate further development of debiasing strategies to ensure equitable societal outcomes.</p></details> |  |

However, achieving efficient real-time performance remains challenging due to the high computational demands of existing models. To overcome this, we propose Dual Process VLA (DP-VLA), a hierarchical framework inspired by dual-process theory. DP-VLA utilizes a Large System 2 Model (L-Sys2) for complex reasoning and decision-making, while a Small System 1 Model (S-Sys1) handles real-time motor control and sensory processing. By leveraging Vision-Language Models (VLMs), the L-Sys2 operates at low frequencies, reducing computational overhead, while the S-Sys1 ensures fast and accurate task execution. Experimental results on the RoboCasa dataset demonstrate that DP-VLA achieves faster inference and higher task success rates, providing a scalable solution for advanced robotic applications.</p></details> | 10 page |

To achieve this, we study a widely useful category of navigation tasks we call Multimodal Instruction Navigation with demonstration Tours (MINT), in which the environment prior is provided through a previously recorded demonstration video. Recent advances in Vision Language Models (VLMs) have shown a promising path in achieving this goal as it demonstrates capabilities in perceiving and reasoning about multimodal inputs. However, VLMs are typically trained to predict textual output and it is an open research question about how to best utilize them in navigation. To solve MINT, we present Mobility VLA, a hierarchical Vision-Language-Action (VLA) navigation policy that combines the environment understanding and common sense reasoning power of long-context VLMs and a robust low-level navigation policy based on topological graphs. The high-level policy consists of a long-context VLM that takes the demonstration tour video and the multimodal user instruction as input to find the goal frame in the tour video. Next, a low-level policy uses the goal frame and an offline constructed topological graph to generate robot actions at every timestep. We evaluated Mobility VLA in a 836m^2 real world environment and show that Mobility VLA has a high end-to-end success rates on previously unsolved multimodal instructions such as "Where should I return this?" while holding a plastic bin.

The optical system's point spread function (PSF) and common CLSM image degradation mechanisms namely photon shot noise, dark current noise, motion blur, speckle noise, and undersampling were modeled and were directly included into model architecture. The model reconstructs high fidelity images from heavily noisy inputs by using convolutional and transposed convolutional layers. Following the advances in compressed sensing, our approach significantly reduces data acquisition requirements without compromising image resolution. The proposed method was extensively evaluated on simulated CLSM images of diverse structures, including lipid droplets, neuronal networks, and fibrillar systems. Comparisons with traditional deconvolution algorithms such as Richardson-Lucy (RL), non-negative least squares (NNLS), and other methods like Total Variation (TV) regularization, Wiener filtering, and Wavelet denoising demonstrate the superiority of the network in restoring fine structural details with high fidelity. Assessment metrics like Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) and Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), underlines that the AdaptivePhysicsAutoencoder achieved robust image enhancement across diverse CLSM conditions, helping faster acquisition, reduced photodamage, and reliable performance in low light and sparse sampling scenarios holding promise for applications in live cell imaging, dynamic biological studies, and high throughput material characterization.</p></details> |  |

The reasons for their remarkable ability to generalize are not well understood yet. It has also been known that deep networks possess the ability to memorize training data, as evidenced by perfect or high training accuracies on models trained with corrupted data that have class labels shuffled to varying degrees. Concomitantly, such models are known to generalize poorly, i.e. they suffer from poor test accuracies, due to which it is thought that the act of memorizing substantially degrades the ability to generalize. It has, however, been unclear why the poor generalization that accompanies such memorization, comes about. One possibility is that in the process of training with corrupted data, the layers of the network irretrievably reorganize their representations in a manner that makes generalization difficult. The other possibility is that the network retains significant ability to generalize, but the trained network somehow chooses to readout in a manner that is detrimental to generalization. Here, we provide evidence for the latter possibility by demonstrating, empirically, that such models possess information in their representations for substantially improved generalization, even in the face of memorization. Furthermore, such generalization abilities can be easily decoded from the internals of the trained model, and we build a technique to do so from the outputs of specific layers of the network. We demonstrate results on multiple models trained with a number of standard datasets.</p></details> |  |

However, their extensive inference time and high memory demands pose challenges for application to large datasets with limited computing resources. Inspired by the state space model in computer vision, we introduce the attention-free Vision Mamba (Vim) to spherical surfaces, presenting a domain-agnostic architecture for analyzing data on spherical manifolds. Our method achieves surface patching by representing spherical data as a sequence of triangular patches derived from a subdivided icosphere. The proposed Surface Vision Mamba (SiM) is evaluated on multiple neurodevelopmental phenotype regression tasks using cortical surface metrics from neonatal brains. Experimental results demonstrate that SiM outperforms both attention- and GDL-based methods, delivering 4.8 times faster inference and achieving 91.7% lower memory consumption compared to the Surface Vision Transformer (SiT) under the Ico-4 grid partitioning. Sensitivity analysis further underscores the potential of SiM to identify subtle cognitive developmental patterns.

This is particularly important for models that need to be robust or are costly to train. LiDAR perception in autonomous driving is impacted by both of these concerns, leading to the emergence of various approaches. This work addresses the challenge by proposing a geometry-based approach, leveraging the sequential structure of LiDAR sensors, which sets it apart from the learning-based methods commonly found in the literature. The proposed method, called 3DLabelProp, is applied on the task of LiDAR Semantic Segmentation (LSS). Through extensive experimentation on seven datasets, it is demonstrated to be a state-of-the-art approach, outperforming both naive and other domain generalization methods.</p></details> |  |

In particular, roto-translations are crucial for effectively modeling geometric graphs and molecules, where understanding the 3D structures enhances generalization. However, equivariant models often pose challenges due to their high computational complexity. In this paper, we introduce REMUL, a training procedure for approximating equivariance with multitask learning. We show that unconstrained models (which do not build equivariance into the architecture) can learn approximate symmetries by minimizing an additional simple equivariance loss. By formulating equivariance as a new learning objective, we can control the level of approximate equivariance in the model. Our method achieves competitive performance compared to equivariant baselines while being $10 \times$ faster at inference and $2.5 \times$ at training.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a novel localization pipeline that directly integrates PV module detection with UAV navigation, allowing precise positioning during inspection. Detections are used to identify the power plant structures in the image and associate these with the power plant model. We define visually recognizable anchor points for the initial association and use object tracking to discern global associations. We present three distinct methods for visual segmentation of PV modules based on traditional computer vision, deep learning, and their fusion, and we evaluate their performance in relation to the proposed localization pipeline. The presented methods were verified and evaluated using custom aerial inspection data sets, demonstrating their robustness and applicability for real-time navigation. Additionally, we evaluate the influence of the power plant model's precision on the localization methods.</p></details> | 47 pages, 22 figures |

As further miniaturization of digital CMOS processors becomes increasingly challenging, alternative computing paradigms, such as analog computing, are gaining consideration. Particularly for compute-intensive tasks such as matrix multiplication, analog computing presents a promising alternative due to its potential for significantly higher energy efficiency compared to conventional digital technology. However, analog computations are inherently noisy, which makes it challenging to maintain high accuracy on deep neural networks. This work investigates the effectiveness of training neural networks with quantization to increase the robustness against noise. Experimental results across various network architectures show that quantization-aware training with constant scaling factors enhances robustness. We compare these methods with noisy training, which incorporates a noise injection during training that mimics the noise encountered during inference. While both two methods increase tolerance against noise, noisy training emerges as the superior approach for achieving robust neural network performance, especially in complex neural architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at AccML workshop co-located HiPEAC 2025</p></details> |

While idiom detection has seen significant progress across various languages, the Kurdish language faces a considerable research gap in this area despite the importance of idioms in tasks like machine translation and sentiment analysis. This study addresses idiom detection in Sorani Kurdish by approaching it as a text classification task using deep learning techniques. To tackle this, we developed a dataset containing 10,580 sentences embedding 101 Sorani Kurdish idioms across diverse contexts. Using this dataset, we developed and evaluated three deep learning models: KuBERT-based transformer sequence classification, a Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network (RCNN), and a BiLSTM model with an attention mechanism. The evaluations revealed that the transformer model, the fine-tuned BERT, consistently outperformed the others, achieving nearly 99% accuracy while the RCNN achieved 96.5% and the BiLSTM 80%. These results highlight the effectiveness of Transformer-based architectures in low-resource languages like Kurdish. This research provides a dataset, three optimized models, and insights into idiom detection, laying a foundation for advancing Kurdish NLP.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 8 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

User interactions with neural networks on hardware accelerators are commonly considered privacy-sensitive. Substantial efforts have been made to uncover vulnerabilities and enhance privacy protection at the level of machine learning algorithms, including membership inference attacks, differential privacy, and federated learning. However, neural networks are ultimately implemented and deployed on physical devices, and current research pays comparatively less attention to privacy protection at the implementation level. In this paper, we introduce a generic physical side-channel attack, ScaAR, that extracts user interactions with neural networks by leveraging electromagnetic (EM) emissions of physical devices. Our proposed attack is implementation-agnostic, meaning it does not require the adversary to possess detailed knowledge of the hardware or software implementations, thanks to the capabilities of deep learning-based side-channel analysis (DLSCA). Experimental results demonstrate that, through the EM side channel, ScaAR can effectively extract the class label of user interactions with neural classifiers, including inputs and outputs, on the AMD-Xilinx MPSoC ZCU104 FPGA and Raspberry Pi 3 B. In addition, for the first time, we provide side-channel analysis on edge Large Language Model (LLM) implementations on the Raspberry Pi 5, showing that EM side channel leaks interaction data, and different LLM tokens can be distinguishable from the EM traces.</p></details> |  |

The main contributions of this work are: (1) demonstrating that a deep learning model, trained on a mix of real and synthetic images, can accurately predict camera and lens parameters from a single image, and (2) developing a comprehensive synthetic dataset using the AILiveSim simulation platform. This dataset includes variations in focal length and lens distortion parameters, providing a robust foundation for model training and testing. The training process predominantly relied on these synthetic images, complemented by a small subset of real images, to explore how well models trained on synthetic data can perform calibration tasks on real-world images. Traditional calibration methods require multiple images of a calibration object from various orientations, which is often not feasible due to the lack of such images in publicly available datasets. A deep learning network based on the ResNet architecture was trained on this synthetic dataset to predict camera calibration parameters following the Brown-Conrady lens model. The ResNet architecture, adapted for regression tasks, is capable of predicting continuous values essential for accurate camera calibration in applications such as autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality. Keywords: Camera calibration, distortion, synthetic data, deep learning, residual networks (ResNet), AILiveSim, horizontal field-of-view, principal point, Brown-Conrady Model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward Improved Deep Learning-based Vulnerability Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03024v2)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning (DL) has been a common thread across several recent techniques for vulnerability detection. The rise of large, publicly available datasets of vulnerabilities has fueled the learning process underpinning these techniques. While these datasets help the DL-based vulnerability detectors, they also constrain these detectors' predictive abilities. Vulnerabilities in these datasets have to be represented in a certain way, e.g., code lines, functions, or program slices within which the vulnerabilities exist. We refer to this representation as a base unit. The detectors learn how base units can be vulnerable and then predict whether other base units are vulnerable. We have hypothesized that this focus on individual base units harms the ability of the detectors to properly detect those vulnerabilities that span multiple base units (or MBU vulnerabilities). For vulnerabilities such as these, a correct detection occurs when all comprising base units are detected as vulnerable. Verifying how existing techniques perform in detecting all parts of a vulnerability is important to establish their effectiveness for other downstream tasks. To evaluate our hypothesis, we conducted a study focusing on three prominent DL-based detectors: ReVeal, DeepWukong, and LineVul. Our study shows that all three detectors contain MBU vulnerabilities in their respective datasets. Further, we observed significant accuracy drops when detecting these types of vulnerabilities. We present our study and a framework that can be used to help DL-based detectors toward the proper inclusion of MBU vulnerabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Classification of Major Depressive Disorder Using Vertex-Wise Brain Sulcal Depth, Curvature, and Thickness with a Deep and a Shallow Learning Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11046v2)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a complex psychiatric disorder that affects the lives of hundreds of millions of individuals around the globe. Even today, researchers debate if morphological alterations in the brain are linked to MDD, likely due to the heterogeneity of this disorder. The application of deep learning tools to neuroimaging data, capable of capturing complex non-linear patterns, has the potential to provide diagnostic and predictive biomarkers for MDD. However, previous attempts to demarcate MDD patients and healthy controls (HC) based on segmented cortical features via linear machine learning approaches have reported low accuracies. Here, we used globally representative data from the ENIGMA-MDD working group containing 7,012 participants from 30 sites (N=2,772 MDD and N=4,240 HC), which allows a comprehensive analysis with generalizable results. Based on the hypothesis that integration of vertex-wise cortical features can improve classification performance, we evaluated the classification of a DenseNet and a Support Vector Machine (SVM), with the expectation that the former would outperform the latter. We found that both classifiers exhibited close to chance performance (balanced accuracy DenseNet: 51%; SVM: 53%), when estimated on unseen sites. Slightly higher classification performance (balanced accuracy DenseNet: 58%; SVM: 55%) was found when the cross-validation folds contained subjects from all sites, indicating site effect. In conclusion, the integration of vertex-wise morphometric features and the use of the non-linear classifier did not lead to the differentiability between MDD and HC. Our results support the notion that MDD classification on this combination of such features and classifiers is unfeasible. Perhaps more sophisticated integration of multimodal information may lead to a higher performance in this diagnostic task.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2206.08122</p></details> |

In recent years, Few-Shot Learning (FSL) has emerged as a learning paradigm that aims to address these limitations by leveraging prior knowledge to enable rapid adaptation to novel learning tasks. Due to its properties that highly complement deep learning's data-intensive needs, FSL has seen significant growth in the past few years. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of both well-established methods as well as recent advancements in the FSL field. The presented taxonomy extends previously proposed ones by incorporating emerging FSL paradigms, such as in-context learning, along with novel categories within the meta-learning paradigm for FSL, including neural processes and probabilistic meta-learning. Furthermore, a holistic overview of FSL is provided by discussing hybrid FSL approaches that extend FSL beyond the typically examined supervised learning setting. The survey also explores FSL's diverse applications across various domains. Finally, recent trends shaping the field, outstanding challenges, and promising future research directions are discussed.</p></details> | <details><summary>63 pa...</summary><p>63 pages, 16 figures.

However, manually quantifying BVs in Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained images is challenging and labor-intensive due to their heterogeneous appearances. We propose a novel approach of constructing guiding maps to improve the performance of state-of-the-art segmentation models for BV segmentation, the guiding maps encourage the models to learn representative features of BVs. This is particularly beneficial for computational pathology, where labeled training data is often limited and large models are prone to overfitting. We have quantitative and qualitative results to demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in improving segmentation accuracy. In future, we plan to validate this method to segment BVs across various tissue types and investigate the role of cellular structures in relation to BVs in the TME.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ISBI 2025</p></details> |

For this reason, deep learning (DL) frameworks are now widely popular. The Holy Grail of DL and one of the most mysterious challenges in all of modern ML is to develop a fundamental understanding of DL optimization and generalization. While numerous optimization techniques have been introduced in the literature to navigate the exploration of the highly non-convex DL optimization landscape, many survey papers reviewing them primarily focus on summarizing these methodologies, often overlooking the critical theoretical analyses of these methods. In this paper, we provide an extensive summary of the theoretical foundations of optimization methods in DL, including presenting various methodologies, their convergence analyses, and generalization abilities. This paper not only includes theoretical analysis of popular generic gradient-based first-order and second-order methods, but it also covers the analysis of the optimization techniques adapting to the properties of the DL loss landscape and explicitly encouraging the discovery of well-generalizing optimal points. Additionally, we extend our discussion to distributed optimization methods that facilitate parallel computations, including both centralized and decentralized approaches. We provide both convex and non-convex analysis for the optimization algorithms considered in this survey paper. Finally, this paper aims to serve as a comprehensive theoretical handbook on optimization methods for DL, offering insights and understanding to both novice and seasoned researchers in the field.</p></details> |  |
| **[Impact of Batch Normalization on Convolutional Network Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14441v1)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Batch normalization (BatchNorm) is a popular layer normalization technique used when training deep neural networks. It has been shown to enhance the training speed and accuracy of deep learning models. However, the mechanics by which BatchNorm achieves these benefits is an active area of research, and different perspectives have been proposed. In this paper, we investigate the effect of BatchNorm on the resulting hidden representations, that is, the vectors of activation values formed as samples are processed at each hidden layer. Specifically, we consider the sparsity of these representations, as well as their implicit clustering -- the creation of groups of representations that are similar to some extent. We contrast image classification models trained with and without batch normalization and highlight consistent differences observed. These findings highlight that BatchNorm's effect on representational sparsity is not a significant factor affecting generalization, while the representations of models trained with BatchNorm tend to show more advantageous clustering characteristics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data-efficient Performance Modeling via Pre-training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14438v1)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Performance models are essential for automatic code optimization, enabling compilers to predict the effects of code transformations on performance and guide search for optimal transformations. Building state-of-the-art performance models with deep learning, however, requires vast labeled datasets of random programs -- an expensive and time-consuming process, stretching over months. This paper introduces a self-supervised pre-training scheme with autoencoders to reduce the need for labeled data. By pre-training on a large dataset of random programs, the autoencoder learns representations of code and transformations, which are then used to embed programs for the performance model. Implemented in the Tiramisu autoscheduler, our approach improves model accuracy with less data. For example, to achieve a MAPE of 20.72%, the original model requires 18 million data points, whereas our method achieves a similar MAPE of 22.44% with only 3.6 million data points, reducing data requirements by 5x.</p></details> |  |

Traditional manual inspection methods are labor-intensive and inconsistent, while existing deep learning models struggle with fine-grained segmentation and computational efficiency. To address these challenges, this study proposes Context-CrackNet, a novel encoder-decoder architecture featuring the Region-Focused Enhancement Module (RFEM) and Context-Aware Global Module (CAGM). These innovations enhance the model's ability to capture fine-grained local details and global contextual dependencies, respectively. Context-CrackNet was rigorously evaluated on ten publicly available crack segmentation datasets, covering diverse pavement distress scenarios. The model consistently outperformed 9 state-of-the-art segmentation frameworks, achieving superior performance metrics such as mIoU and Dice score, while maintaining competitive inference efficiency. Ablation studies confirmed the complementary roles of RFEM and CAGM, with notable improvements in mIoU and Dice score when both modules were integrated. Additionally, the model's balance of precision and computational efficiency highlights its potential for real-time deployment in large-scale pavement monitoring systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[ECTIL: Label-efficient Computational Tumour Infiltrating Lymphocyte (TIL) assessment in breast cancer: Multicentre validation in 2,340 patients with breast cancer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14379v1)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The level of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) is a prognostic factor for patients with (triple-negative) breast cancer (BC). Computational TIL assessment (CTA) has the potential to assist pathologists in this labour-intensive task, but current CTA models rely heavily on many detailed annotations. We propose and validate a fundamentally simpler deep learning based CTA that can be trained in only ten minutes on hundredfold fewer pathologist annotations. We collected whole slide images (WSIs) with TILs scores and clinical data of 2,340 patients with BC from six cohorts including three randomised clinical trials. Morphological features were extracted from whole slide images (WSIs) using a pathology foundation model. Our label-efficient Computational stromal TIL assessment model (ECTIL) directly regresses the TILs score from these features. ECTIL trained on only a few hundred samples (ECTIL-TCGA) showed concordance with the pathologist over five heterogeneous external cohorts (r=0.54-0.74, AUROC=0.80-0.94). Training on all slides of five cohorts (ECTIL-combined) improved results on a held-out test set (r=0.69, AUROC=0.85). Multivariable Cox regression analyses indicated that every 10% increase of ECTIL scores was associated with improved overall survival independent of clinicopathological variables (HR 0.86, p<0.01), similar to the pathologist score (HR 0.87, p<0.001). We demonstrate that ECTIL is highly concordant with an expert pathologist and obtains a similar hazard ratio. ECTIL has a fundamentally simpler design than existing methods and can be trained on orders of magnitude fewer annotations. Such a CTA may be used to pre-screen patients for, e.g., immunotherapy clinical trial inclusion, or as a tool to assist clinicians in the diagnostic work-up of patients with BC. Our model is available under an open source licence (https://github.com/nki-ai/ectil).</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review. 54 pages including supplementary materials, 2 main tables, 3 main figures, 14 supplementary figures, 4 supplementary tables</p></details> |

When the cluster's core count increases, a flat all-to-all interconnect between cores and L1 memory banks becomes a physical implementation bottleneck, and hierarchical network topologies are required. However, hierarchical, multi-level intra-cluster networks are subject to internal contention which may lead to significant performance degradation, especially for SIMD or vector cores, as their memory access is bursty. We present the TCDM Burst Access architecture, a software-transparent burst transaction support to improve bandwidth utilization in clusters with many vector cores tightly coupled to a multi-banked L1 data memory. In our solution, a Burst Manager dispatches burst requests to L1 memory banks, multiple 32b words from burst responses are retired in parallel on channels with parametric data-width. We validate our design on a RISC-V Vector (RVV) many-core cluster, evaluating the benefits on different core counts. With minimal logic area overhead (less than 8%), we improve the bandwidth of a 16-, a 256-, and a 1024--Floating Point Unit (FPU) baseline clusters, without Tightly Coupled Data Memory (TCDM) Burst Access, by 118%, 226%, and 77% respectively. Reaching up to 80% of the cores-memory peak bandwidth, our design demonstrates ultra-high bandwidth utilization and enables efficient performance scaling. Implemented in 12-nm FinFET technology node, compared to the serialized access baseline, our solution achieves up to 1.9x energy efficiency and 2.76x performance in real-world kernel benchmarkings.</p></details> |  |

However, previous studies on its efficient GPU implementation are mostly merge-based and rely heavily on the fast but size-limited on-chip memory, thereby limiting the scalability with a restricted upper bound on k. This work introduces a scalable and optimized GPU-parallel radix top-k selection that supports significantly larger k values than existing methods without compromising efficiency, regardless of input length and batch size. Our method incorporates a novel optimization framework tailored for high memory bandwidth and resource utilization, achieving up to 2.5x speedup over the prior art for non-batch queries and up to 4.8x speedup for batch queries. In addition, we propose an adaptive scaling technique that strengthens the robustness, which further provides up to 2.7x speedup on highly adversarial input distributions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at the 38th ACM International Conference on Supercomputing (ICS '24)</p></details> |

Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the field of code summarization, providing sophisticated methods for generating concise and accurate summaries of source code. This study aims to perform a comparative analysis of several open-source LLMs, namely LLaMA-3, Phi-3, Mistral, and Gemma. These models' performance is assessed using important metrics such as BLEU\textsubscript{3.1} and ROUGE\textsubscript{3.2}. Through this analysis, we seek to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each model, offering insights into their applicability and effectiveness in code summarization tasks. Our findings contribute to the ongoing development and refinement of LLMs, supporting their integration into tools that enhance software development and maintenance processes.</p></details> |  |

Recent advancements in deep learning offer a promising solution for predicting changes in AMD from optical coherence tomography (OCT) retinal volumes. In this work, we proposed deep learning models for the two tasks of the public MARIO Challenge at MICCAI 2024, designed to detect and forecast changes in nAMD severity with longitudinal retinal OCT. For the first task, we employ a Vision Transformer (ViT) based Siamese Network to detect changes in AMD severity by comparing scan embeddings of a patient from different time points. To train a model to forecast the change after 3 months, we exploit, for the first time, an Earth Mover (Wasserstein) Distance-based loss to harness the ordinal relation within the severity change classes. Both models ranked high on the preliminary leaderboard, demonstrating that their predictive capabilities could facilitate nAMD treatment management.</p></details> | <details><summary>Solut...</summary><p>Solution to the MICCAI 2024 MARIO Challange.

However, the domain of road damage detection remains relatively under explored, despite its critical significance for applications such as infrastructure maintenance and road safety. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a novel top down benchmark that offers a complementary perspective to existing datasets, specifically tailored for road damage detection. Our proposed Top Down Road Damage Detection Dataset (TDRD) includes three primary categories of road damage cracks, potholes, and patches captured from a top down viewpoint. The dataset consists of 7,088 high resolution images, encompassing 12,882 annotated instances of road damage. Additionally, we present a novel real time object detection framework, TDYOLOV10, designed to handle the unique challenges posed by the TDRD dataset. Comparative studies with state of the art models demonstrate competitive baseline results. By releasing TDRD, we aim to accelerate research in this crucial area. A sample of the dataset will be made publicly available upon the paper's acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-aspect Knowledge Distillation with Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13341v2)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in deep learning have significantly improved performance on computer vision tasks. Previous image classification methods primarily modify model architectures or add features, and they optimize models using cross-entropy loss on class logits. Since they focus on classifying images with considering class labels, these methods may struggle to learn various \emph{aspects} of classes (e.g., natural positions and shape changes). Rethinking the previous approach from a novel view, we propose a multi-aspect knowledge distillation method using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Our approach involves: 1) querying Large Language Model with multi-aspect questions relevant to the knowledge we want to transfer to the model, 2) extracting corresponding logits from MLLM, and 3) expanding the model's output dimensions to distill these multi-aspect logits. We then apply cross-entropy loss to class logits and binary cross-entropy loss to multi-aspect logits. Through our method, the model can learn not only the knowledge about visual aspects but also the abstract and complex aspects that require a deeper understanding. We primarily apply our method to image classification, and to explore the potential for extending our model, we expand it to other tasks, such as object detection. In all experimental results, our method improves the performance of the baselines. Additionally, we analyze the effect of multi-aspect knowledge distillation. These results demonstrate that our method can transfer knowledge about various aspects to the model and the aspect knowledge can enhance model performance in computer vision tasks. This paper demonstrates the great potential of multi-aspect knowledge distillation, and we believe it offers a promising direction for future research in computer vision and beyond.</p></details> | Preprint |

While obtaining these relevance labels from real users is ideal, scaling such data collection is challenging. Consequently, third-party annotators are employed, but their inconsistent accuracy demands costly auditing, training, and monitoring. We propose an LLM-based modular classification pipeline that divides the relevance assessment task into multiple stages, each utilising different prompts and models of varying sizes and capabilities. Applied to TREC Deep Learning (TREC-DL), one of our approaches showed an 18.4% Krippendorff's $\alpha$ accuracy increase over OpenAI's GPT-4o mini while maintaining a cost of about 0.2 USD per million input tokens, offering a more efficient and scalable solution for relevance assessment. This approach beats the baseline performance of GPT-4o (5 USD). With a pipeline approach, even the accuracy of the GPT-4o flagship model, measured in $\alpha$, could be improved by 9.7%.</p></details> | WebConf'25, WWW'25 |

Traditional statistical TPPs have a long-standing history, with numerous models proposed and successfully applied across diverse domains. In recent years, advances in deep learning have spurred the development of neural TPPs, enabling greater flexibility and expressiveness in capturing complex temporal dynamics.

This survey presents a comprehensive review of recent research on TPPs from three perspectives: Bayesian, deep learning, and LLM approaches. We begin with a review of the fundamental concepts of TPPs, followed by an in-depth discussion of model design and parameter estimation techniques in these three frameworks. We also revisit classic application areas of TPPs to highlight their practical relevance. Finally, we outline challenges and promising directions for future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhanced Encoder-Decoder Architecture for Accurate Monocular Depth Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11610v5)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating depth from a single 2D image is a challenging task due to the lack of stereo or multi-view data, which are typically required for depth perception. In state-of-the-art architectures, the main challenge is to efficiently capture complex objects and fine-grained details, which are often difficult to predict. This paper introduces a novel deep learning-based approach using an enhanced encoder-decoder architecture, where the Inception-ResNet-v2 model serves as the encoder. This is the first instance of utilizing Inception-ResNet-v2 as an encoder for monocular depth estimation, demonstrating improved performance over previous models. It incorporates multi-scale feature extraction to enhance depth prediction accuracy across various object sizes and distances. We propose a composite loss function comprising depth loss, gradient edge loss, and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) loss, with fine-tuned weights to optimize the weighted sum, ensuring a balance across different aspects of depth estimation. Experimental results on the KITTI dataset show that our model achieves a significantly faster inference time of 0.019 seconds, outperforming vision transformers in efficiency while maintaining good accuracy. On the NYU Depth V2 dataset, the model establishes state-of-the-art performance, with an Absolute Relative Error (ARE) of 0.064, a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.228, and an accuracy of 89.3% for $\delta$ < 1.25. These metrics demonstrate that our model can accurately and efficiently predict depth even in challenging scenarios, providing a practical solution for real-time applications.</p></details> |  |

Here, we introduce a snapshot multi-spectral imaging approach employing a standard monochrome image sensor with no additional spectral filters or customized components. Our system leverages the inherent chromatic aberration of wavelength-dependent defocusing as a natural source of physical encoding of multi-spectral information; this encoded image information is rapidly decoded via a deep learning-based multi-spectral Fourier Imager Network (mFIN). We experimentally tested our method with six illumination bands and demonstrated an overall accuracy of 92.98% for predicting the illumination channels at the input and achieved a robust multi-spectral image reconstruction on various test objects. This deep learning-powered framework achieves high-quality multi-spectral image reconstruction using snapshot image acquisition with a monochrome image sensor and could be useful for applications in biomedicine, industrial quality control, and agriculture, among others.</p></details> | 22 Pages, 7 Figures |

Severe class imbalance and the complexity of medical images hinder automated analysis. This study leverages deep learning techniques, including transfer learning on pre-trained models (AlexNet, ResNet, and InceptionNet), to enhance disease detection and classification. By fine-tuning these models and incorporating focal loss to address class imbalance, significant performance improvements were achieved. Grad-CAM visualizations further enhance model interpretability, providing insights into clinically relevant regions influencing predictions. The InceptionV3 model, for instance, achieved a 28% improvement in AUC and a 15% increase in F1-Score. These findings highlight the potential of deep learning to improve diagnostic workflows and support clinical decision-making.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Applicable and Comprehensive Knowledge Tracing in Large-Scale Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14256v1)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge Tracing (KT) is a fundamental component of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS), enabling the modeling of students' knowledge states to predict future performance. The introduction of Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT), the first deep learning-based KT (DLKT) model, has brought significant advantages in terms of applicability and comprehensiveness. However, recent DLKT models, such as Attentive Knowledge Tracing (AKT), have often prioritized predictive performance at the expense of these benefits. While deep sequential models like DKT have shown potential, they face challenges related to parallel computing, storage decision modification, and limited storage capacity. To address these limitations, we propose DKT2, a novel KT model that leverages the recently developed xLSTM architecture. DKT2 enhances input representation using the Rasch model and incorporates Item Response Theory (IRT) for interpretability, allowing for the decomposition of learned knowledge into familiar and unfamiliar knowledge. By integrating this knowledge with predicted questions, DKT2 generates comprehensive knowledge states. Extensive experiments conducted across three large-scale datasets demonstrate that DKT2 consistently outperforms 17 baseline models in various prediction tasks, underscoring its potential for real-world educational applications. This work bridges the gap between theoretical advancements and practical implementation in KT.Our code and datasets will be available at https://github.com/codebase-2025/DKT2.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distributionally Robust Coreset Selection under Covariate Shift](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14253v1)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coreset selection, which involves selecting a small subset from an existing training dataset, is an approach to reducing training data, and various approaches have been proposed for this method. In practical situations where these methods are employed, it is often the case that the data distributions differ between the development phase and the deployment phase, with the latter being unknown. Thus, it is challenging to select an effective subset of training data that performs well across all deployment scenarios. We therefore propose Distributionally Robust Coreset Selection (DRCS). DRCS theoretically derives an estimate of the upper bound for the worst-case test error, assuming that the future covariate distribution may deviate within a defined range from the training distribution. Furthermore, by selecting instances in a way that suppresses the estimate of the upper bound for the worst-case test error, DRCS achieves distributionally robust training instance selection. This study is primarily applicable to convex training computation, but we demonstrate that it can also be applied to deep learning under appropriate approximations. In this paper, we focus on covariate shift, a type of data distribution shift, and demonstrate the effectiveness of DRCS through experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[In-Situ Fine-Tuning of Wildlife Models in IoT-Enabled Camera Traps for Efficient Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07796v2)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Resource-constrained IoT devices increasingly rely on deep learning models for inference tasks in remote environments. However, these models experience significant accuracy drops due to domain shifts when encountering variations in lighting, weather, and seasonal conditions. While cloud-based retraining can address this issue, many IoT deployments operate with limited connectivity and energy constraints, making traditional fine-tuning approaches impractical. We explore this challenge through the lens of wildlife ecology, where camera traps must maintain accurate species classification across changing seasons, weather, and habitats without reliable connectivity. We introduce WildFit, an autonomous in-situ adaptation framework that leverages the key insight that background scenes change more frequently than the visual characteristics of monitored species. WildFit combines background-aware synthesis to generate training samples on-device with drift-aware fine-tuning that triggers model updates only when necessary to conserve resources. Through extensive evaluation on multiple camera trap deployments, we demonstrate that WildFit significantly improves accuracy while greatly reducing adaptation overhead compared to traditional approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[GreedyPixel: Fine-Grained Black-Box Adversarial Attack Via Greedy Algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14230v1)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A critical requirement for deep learning models is ensuring their robustness against adversarial attacks. These attacks commonly introduce noticeable perturbations, compromising the visual fidelity of adversarial examples. Another key challenge is that while white-box algorithms can generate effective adversarial perturbations, they require access to the model gradients, limiting their practicality in many real-world scenarios. Existing attack mechanisms struggle to achieve similar efficacy without access to these gradients. In this paper, we introduce GreedyPixel, a novel pixel-wise greedy algorithm designed to generate high-quality adversarial examples using only query-based feedback from the target model. GreedyPixel improves computational efficiency in what is typically a brute-force process by perturbing individual pixels in sequence, guided by a pixel-wise priority map. This priority map is constructed by ranking gradients obtained from a surrogate model, providing a structured path for perturbation. Our results demonstrate that GreedyPixel achieves attack success rates comparable to white-box methods without the need for gradient information, and surpasses existing algorithms in black-box settings, offering higher success rates, reduced computational time, and imperceptible perturbations. These findings underscore the advantages of GreedyPixel in terms of attack efficacy, time efficiency, and visual quality.</p></details> |  |

However,its diagnosis is both arduous and time consuming. This study proposes a novel approach for diagnosing leukemia across four stages Benign,Early,Pre,and Pro using deep learning techniques.We employed two Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models as MobileNetV2 with an altered head and a custom model. The custom model consists of multiple convolutional layers,each paired with corresponding max pooling layers.We utilized MobileNetV2 with ImageNet weights,adjusting the head to integrate the final results.The dataset used is the publicly available "Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) Image Dataset", and we applied the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) to augment and balance the training dataset.The custom model achieved an accuracy of 98.6%, while MobileNetV2 attained a superior accuracy of 99.69%. The pretrained model showed promising results,indicating an increased likelihood of real-world application.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 4 figures, Submitted to UCICS</p></details> |

Accurate tracking of these layers is essential to calculate their thicknesses, which are required to investigate the contribution of polar ice cap melt to sea-level rise. However, automatically processing the radar echograms to detect the underlying snow layers is a challenging problem. In our work, we develop wavelet-based multi-scale deep learning architectures for these radar echograms to improve snow layer detection. These architectures estimate the layer depths with a mean absolute error of 3.31 pixels and 94.3% average precision, achieving higher generalizability as compared to state-of-the-art snow layer detection networks. These depth estimates also agree well with physically drilled stake measurements. Such robust architectures can be used on echograms from future missions to efficiently trace snow layers, estimate their individual thicknesses and thus support sea-level rise projection models.</p></details> |  |

For our study, we selected SqueezeNet1.1 as it is one of the most popular lightweight architectures. SqueezeNet1.1 is a later version of SqueezeNet1.0 and is 2.4 times more computationally efficient than the original model. We proposed and implemented three ultra-lightweight architecture variants to SqueezeNet1.1 architecture, namely Variant 1 (one fire module), Variant 2 (two fire modules), and Variant 3 (four fire modules), which are even more compact than SqueezeNetV1.1 (eight fire modules). These models were implemented to evaluate the best performing variant that achieves superior computational efficiency without sacrificing accuracy in malaria blood cell classification. The models were trained and evaluated using the NIH Malaria dataset. We assessed each model's performance based on metrics including accuracy, recall, precision, F1-score, and Area Under the Curve (AUC). The results show that the SqueezeNet1.1 model achieves the highest performance across all metrics, with a classification accuracy of 97.12%. Variant 3 (four fire modules) offers a competitive alternative, delivering almost identical results (accuracy 96.55%) with a 6x reduction in computational overhead compared to SqueezeNet1.1. Variant 2 and Variant 1 perform slightly lower than Variant 3, with Variant 2 (two fire modules) reducing computational overhead by 28x, and Variant 1 (one fire module) achieving a 54x reduction in trainable parameters compared to SqueezeNet1.1. These findings demonstrate that our SqueezeNet1.1 architecture variants provide a flexible approach to malaria detection, enabling the selection of a variant that balances resource constraints and performance.</p></details> |  |

However, its long acquisition times can lead to patient discomfort, motion artifacts, and limiting real-time applications. To address these challenges, strategies such as parallel imaging have been applied, which utilize multiple receiver coils to speed up the data acquisition process. Additionally, compressed sensing (CS) is a method that facilitates image reconstruction from sparse data, significantly reducing image acquisition time by minimizing the amount of data collection needed. Recently, deep learning (DL) has emerged as a powerful tool for improving MRI reconstruction. It has been integrated with parallel imaging and CS principles to achieve faster and more accurate MRI reconstructions. This review comprehensively examines DL-based techniques for MRI reconstruction. We categorize and discuss various DL-based methods, including end-to-end approaches, unrolled optimization, and federated learning, highlighting their potential benefits. Our systematic review highlights significant contributions and underscores the potential of DL in MRI reconstruction. Additionally, we summarize key results and trends in DL-based MRI reconstruction, including quantitative metrics, the dataset, acceleration factors, and the progress of and research interest in DL techniques over time. Finally, we discuss potential future directions and the importance of DL-based MRI reconstruction in advancing medical imaging. To facilitate further research in this area, we provide a GitHub repository that includes up-to-date DL-based MRI reconstruction publications and public datasets-https://github.com/mosaf/Awesome-DL-based-CS-MRI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Prescriptive Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14152v1)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a multimodal deep learning framework, Prescriptive Neural Networks (PNNs), that combines ideas from optimization and machine learning, and is, to the best of our knowledge, the first prescriptive method to handle multimodal data. The PNN is a feedforward neural network trained on embeddings to output an outcome-optimizing prescription. In two real-world multimodal datasets, we demonstrate that PNNs prescribe treatments that are able to significantly improve estimated outcomes in transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) procedures by reducing estimated postoperative complication rates by 32% and in liver trauma injuries by reducing estimated mortality rates by over 40%. In four real-world, unimodal tabular datasets, we demonstrate that PNNs outperform or perform comparably to other well-known, state-of-the-art prescriptive models; importantly, on tabular datasets, we also recover interpretability through knowledge distillation, fitting interpretable Optimal Classification Tree models onto the PNN prescriptions as classification targets, which is critical for many real-world applications. Finally, we demonstrate that our multimodal PNN models achieve stability across randomized data splits comparable to other prescriptive methods and produce realistic prescriptions across the different datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Spatio-Temporal State-Space Modeling for fMRI Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13074v2)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in deep learning structured state space models, especially the Mamba architecture, have demonstrated remarkable performance improvements while maintaining linear complexity. In this study, we introduce functional spatiotemporal Mamba (FST-Mamba), a Mamba-based model designed for discovering neurological biomarkers using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We focus on dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC) derived from fMRI and propose a hierarchical spatiotemporal Mamba-based network that processes spatial and temporal information separately using Mamba-based encoders. Leveraging the topological uniqueness of the FNC matrix, we introduce a component-wise varied-scale aggregation (CVA) mechanism to aggregate connectivity across individual components within brain networks, enabling the model to capture component-level and network-level information. Additionally, we propose symmetric rotary position encoding (SymRope) to encode the relative positions of each functional connection while considering the symmetric nature of the FNC matrix. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in the proposed FST-Mamba model on various brain-based classification and regression tasks. We further show brain connectivities and dynamics that are crucial for the prediction. Our work reveals the substantial potential of attention-free sequence modeling in brain discovery.

| **[Prior Knowledge Injection into Deep Learning Models Predicting Gene Expression from Whole Slide Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14056v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cancer diagnosis and prognosis primarily depend on clinical parameters such as age and tumor grade, and are increasingly complemented by molecular data, such as gene expression, from tumor sequencing. However, sequencing is costly and delays oncology workflows. Recent advances in Deep Learning allow to predict molecular information from morphological features within Whole Slide Images (WSIs), offering a cost-effective proxy of the molecular markers. While promising, current methods lack the robustness to fully replace direct sequencing. Here we aim to improve existing methods by introducing a model-agnostic framework that allows to inject prior knowledge on gene-gene interactions into Deep Learning architectures, thereby increasing accuracy and robustness. We design the framework to be generic and flexibly adaptable to a wide range of architectures. In a case study on breast cancer, our strategy leads to an average increase of 983 significant genes (out of 25,761) across all 18 experiments, with 14 generalizing to an increase on an independent dataset. Our findings reveal a high potential for injection of prior knowledge to increase gene expression prediction performance from WSIs across a wide range of architectures.</p></details> |  |

During recovery, older adults frequently face social isolation and functional decline, complicating rehabilitation and adversely affecting physical and mental health. Multi-modal sensor platforms that continuously collect data and analyze it using machine-learning algorithms can remotely monitor this population and infer health outcomes. They can also alert clinicians to individuals at risk of isolation and decline. This paper presents a new publicly available multi-modal sensor dataset, MAISON-LLF, collected from older adults recovering from LLF in community settings. The dataset includes data from smartphone and smartwatch sensors, motion detectors, sleep-tracking mattresses, and clinical questionnaires on isolation and decline. The dataset was collected from ten older adults living alone at home for eight weeks each, totaling 560 days of 24-hour sensor data. For technical validation, supervised machine-learning and deep-learning models were developed using the sensor and clinical questionnaire data, providing a foundational comparison for the research community.</p></details> |  |

State-of-the-art architectures, while producing promising results on the UCR and the UEA archives , present a high number of trainable parameters. This can lead to long training with high CO2 emission, power consumption and possible increase in the number of FLoating-point Operation Per Second (FLOPS). In this paper, we present a new architecture for TSC, the Light Inception with boosTing tEchnique (LITE) with only 2.34% of the number of parameters of the state-of-the-art InceptionTime model, while preserving performance. This architecture, with only 9, 814 trainable parameters due to the usage of DepthWise Separable Convolutions (DWSC), is boosted by three techniques: multiplexing, custom filters, and dilated convolution. The LITE architecture, trained on the UCR, is 2.78 times faster than InceptionTime and consumes 2.79 times less CO2 and power. To evaluate the performance of the proposed architecture on multivariate time series data, we adapt LITE to handle multivariate time series, we call this version LITEMV. To bring theory into application, we also conducted experiments using LITEMV on multivariate time series representing human rehabilitation movements, showing that LITEMV not only is the most efficient model but also the best performing for this application on the Kimore dataset, a skeleton based human rehabilitation exercises dataset. Moreover, to address the interpretability of LITEMV, we present a study using Class Activation Maps to understand the classification decision taken by the model during evaluation.</p></details> |  |

However, the geometry of coupled constraints hampers the well-developed low-rank structure and makes the problem intricate. To this end, we propose a space-decoupling framework for optimization on bounded-rank matrices with orthogonally invariant constraints. The ``space-decoupling" is reflected in several ways. We show that the tangent cone of coupled constraints is the intersection of tangent cones of each constraint. Moreover, we decouple the intertwined bounded-rank and orthogonally invariant constraints into two spaces, leading to optimization on a smooth manifold. Implementing Riemannian algorithms on this manifold is painless as long as the geometry of additional constraints is known. In addition, we unveil the equivalence between the reformulated problem and the original problem. Numerical experiments on real-world applications -- spherical data fitting, graph similarity measuring, low-rank SDP, model reduction of Markov processes, reinforcement learning, and deep learning -- validate the superiority of the proposed framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>48 pa...</summary><p>48 pages, 12 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

The majority of results in AI thus far have been achieved using deep neural networks trained with the error backpropagation learning algorithm. However, the ubiquitous adoption of this approach has highlighted some important limitations such as substantial computational cost, difficulty in quantifying uncertainty, lack of robustness, unreliability, and biological implausibility. It is possible that addressing these limitations may require schemes that are inspired and guided by neuroscience theories. One such theory, called predictive coding (PC), has shown promising performance in machine intelligence tasks, exhibiting exciting properties that make it potentially valuable for the machine learning community: PC can model information processing in different brain areas, can be used in cognitive control and robotics, and has a solid mathematical grounding in variational inference, offering a powerful inversion scheme for a specific class of continuous-state generative models. With the hope of foregrounding research in this direction, we survey the literature that has contributed to this perspective, highlighting the many ways that PC might play a role in the future of machine learning and computational intelligence at large.</p></details> | 37 Pages, 9 Figures |
| **[How to Efficiently Annotate Images for Best-Performing Deep Learning Based Segmentation Models: An Empirical Study with Weak and Noisy Annotations and Segment Anything Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10600v3)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated exceptional performance across various image segmentation tasks. However, the process of preparing datasets for training segmentation DNNs is both labor-intensive and costly, as it typically requires pixel-level annotations for each object of interest. To mitigate this challenge, alternative approaches such as using weak labels (e.g., bounding boxes or scribbles) or less precise (noisy) annotations can be employed. Noisy and weak labels are significantly quicker to generate, allowing for more annotated images within the same time frame. However, the potential decrease in annotation quality may adversely impact the segmentation performance of the resulting model. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive cost-effectiveness evaluation on six variants of annotation strategies (9~10 sub-variants in total) across 4 datasets and conclude that the common practice of precisely outlining objects of interest is virtually never the optimal approach when annotation budget is limited. Both noisy and weak annotations showed usage cases that yield similar performance to the perfectly annotated counterpart, yet had significantly better cost-effectiveness. We hope our findings will help researchers be aware of the different available options and use their annotation budgets more efficiently, especially in cases where accurately acquiring labels for target objects is particularly costly.

In this process, embedding models transform raw text into numerical vectors. However, the embedding models that currently excel on text embedding benchmarks, like the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB), often have numerous parameters and high vector dimensionality. This poses challenges for their application in real-world scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a novel multi-stage distillation framework that enables a smaller student embedding model to distill multiple larger teacher embedding models through three carefully designed losses. Meanwhile, we utilize Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) to reduce the vector dimensionality of the student embedding model effectively. Our student model named Jasper with 2 billion parameters, built upon the Stella embedding model, obtained the No.3 position on the MTEB leaderboard (as of December 24, 2024), achieving an average 71.54 score across 56 datasets. We have released the model and data on the Hugging Face Hub (https://huggingface.co/infgrad/jasper_en_vision_language_v1) (https://huggingface.co/datasets/infgrad/jasper_text_distill_dataset), and the training codes are available in this project repository (https://github.com/NLPJCL/RAG-Retrieval).</p></details> | 7 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Integrating Causality with Neurochaos Learning: Proposed Approach and Research Agenda](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13763v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning implemented via neural networks, has revolutionized machine learning by providing methods for complex tasks such as object detection/classification and prediction. However, architectures based on deep neural networks have started to yield diminishing returns, primarily due to their statistical nature and inability to capture causal structure in the training data. Another issue with deep learning is its high energy consumption, which is not that desirable from a sustainability perspective. Therefore, alternative approaches are being considered to address these issues, both of which are inspired by the functioning of the human brain. One approach is causal learning, which takes into account causality among the items in the dataset on which the neural network is trained. It is expected that this will help minimize the spurious correlations that are prevalent in the learned representations of deep neural networks. The other approach is Neurochaos Learning, a recent development, which draws its inspiration from the nonlinear chaotic firing intrinsic to neurons in biological neural networks (brain/central nervous system). Both approaches have shown improved results over just deep learning alone. To that end, in this position paper, we investigate how causal and neurochaos learning approaches can be integrated together to produce better results, especially in domains that contain linked data. We propose an approach for this integration to enhance classification, prediction and reinforcement learning. We also propose a set of research questions that need to be investigated in order to make this integration a reality.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[Invariance Principle Meets Vicinal Risk Minimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05765v2)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models excel in computer vision tasks but often fail to generalize to out-of-distribution (OOD) domains. Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) aims to address OOD generalization by learning domain-invariant features. However, IRM struggles with datasets exhibiting significant diversity shifts. While data augmentation methods like Mixup and Semantic Data Augmentation (SDA) enhance diversity, they risk over-augmentation and label instability. To address these challenges, we propose a domain-shared Semantic Data Augmentation (SDA) module, a novel implementation of Variance Risk Minimization (VRM) designed to enhance dataset diversity while maintaining label consistency. We further provide a Rademacher complexity analysis, establishing a tighter generalization error bound compared to baseline methods. Extensive evaluations on OOD benchmarks, including PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome, and TerraIncognita, demonstrate consistent performance improvements over state-of-the-art domain generalization methods.</p></details> |  |

The continuous advancements in deep learning, particularly pre-trained models, have empowered the code generation task to achieve remarkable performance. One main challenge of pre-trained models for code generation is the semantic gap between natural language requirements and source code. To address the issue, prior studies typically adopt a retrieval-augmented framework for the task, where the similar code snippets collected by a retrieval process can be leveraged to help understand the requirements and provide guidance for the generation process. However, there is a lack of systematic study on the application of this framework for code generation, including the impact of the final generated results and the specific usage of the framework. In this paper, we choose three popular pre-trained code models, namely CodeGen, UniXcoder, and CodeT5, to assess the impact of the quality and utilization of retrieved code on the retrieval-augmented framework. Our analysis shows that the retrieval-augmented framework is beneficial for improving the performance of the existing pre-trained models. We also provide suggestions on the utilization of the retrieval-augmented code generation framework: BM25 and Sequential Integration Fusion are recommended due to their convenience and superior performance. Sketch Filling Fusion, which extracts a sketch of relevant code, could help the model improve its performance further. Additionally, we conduct experiments to investigate the influence of the retrieval-augmented framework on large language models for code generation, showing the effectiveness of the framework, and we discuss the trade-off between performance improvement and computational costs in each phase within the framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by TOSEM</p></details> |

However, intermittently powered batteryless systems often suffer from incomplete sensor data due to the stochastic nature of energy harvesting. Existing methods struggle with missing channels, leading to significant performance degradation. In this paper, we propose $\textit{LOCUS}$, a novel deep learning-based system designed to recover corrupted features for SSL in batteryless systems. $\textit{LOCUS}$ addresses missing data by leveraging information entropy estimation and conditional interpolation, combining three modules: (1) Information-Weighted Focus (InFo), which identifies and quantifies corrupted data elements, (2) Latent Feature Synthesizer (LaFS), which synthesizes missing features, and (3) Guided Replacement (GRep), which intelligently replaces missing elements while preserving valid data. We demonstrate significant performance improvements using two datasets: DCASE and LargeSet, where $\textit{LOCUS}$ achieves up to $36.91\%$ lower DoA error compared to existing methods. Real-world evaluations across three environments with intermittent power sources show a $25.87-59.46\%$ improvement in performance when channels are stochastically missing. Additionally, we release a 50-hour multichannel dataset to support further research in SSL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sample complexity of data-driven tuning of model hyperparameters in neural networks with structured parameter-dependent dual function](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13734v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern machine learning algorithms, especially deep learning based techniques, typically involve careful hyperparameter tuning to achieve the best performance. Despite the surge of intense interest in practical techniques like Bayesian optimization and random search based approaches to automating this laborious and compute-intensive task, the fundamental learning theoretic complexity of tuning hyperparameters for deep neural networks is poorly understood. Inspired by this glaring gap, we initiate the formal study of hyperparameter tuning complexity in deep learning through a recently introduced data driven setting. We assume that we have a series of deep learning tasks, and we have to tune hyperparameters to do well on average over the distribution of tasks. A major difficulty is that the utility function as a function of the hyperparameter is very volatile and furthermore, it is given implicitly by an optimization problem over the model parameters. This is unlike previous work in data driven design, where one can typically explicitly model the algorithmic behavior as a function of the hyperparameters. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a new technique to characterize the discontinuities and oscillations of the utility function on any fixed problem instance as we vary the hyperparameter, our analysis relies on subtle concepts including tools from differential/algebraic geometry and constrained optimization. This can be used to show that the learning theoretic complexity of the corresponding family of utility functions is bounded. We instantiate our results and provide sample complexity bounds for concrete applications tuning a hyperparameter that interpolates neural activation functions and setting the kernel parameter in graph neural networks.</p></details> | 48 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Validating Deep Learning Weather Forecast Models on Recent High-Impact Extreme Events](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17652v2)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The forecast accuracy of machine learning (ML) weather prediction models is improving rapidly, leading many to speak of a "second revolution in weather forecasting". With numerous methods being developed and limited physical guarantees offered by ML models, there is a critical need for a comprehensive evaluation of these emerging techniques. While this need has been partly fulfilled by benchmark datasets, they provide little information on rare and impactful extreme events or on compound impact metrics, for which model accuracy might degrade due to misrepresented dependencies between variables. To address these issues, we compare ML weather prediction models (GraphCast, PanguWeather, and FourCastNet) and ECMWF's high-resolution forecast system (HRES) in three case studies: the 2021 Pacific Northwest heatwave, the 2023 South Asian humid heatwave, and the North American winter storm in 2021. We find that ML weather prediction models locally achieve similar accuracy to HRES on the record-shattering Pacific Northwest heatwave but underperform when aggregated over space and time. However, they forecast the compound winter storm substantially better. We also highlight structural differences in how the errors of HRES and the ML models build up to that event. The ML forecasts lack important variables for a detailed assessment of the health risks of the 2023 humid heatwave. Using a possible substitute variable, prediction errors show spatial patterns with the highest danger levels over Bangladesh being underestimated by the ML models. Generally, case-study-driven, impact-centric evaluation can complement existing research, increase public trust, and aid in developing reliable ML weather prediction models.</p></details> |  |

Despite its competitive performance on numerous benchmarks, it still follows a `one-size-fits-all' approach, which aims to train a single, monolithic architecture that generalises across different noises and environments. However, its limited size and computation budget can hamper its generalisability. Recent work has shown that in-context adaptation can improve performance by conditioning the denoising process on additional information extracted from background recordings to mitigate this. These recordings can be offloaded outside the hearing aid, thus improving performance while adding minimal computational overhead. We introduce these principles to the DFN model, thus proposing the DFingerNet (DFiN) model, which shows superior performance on various benchmarks inspired by the DNS Challenge.</p></details> | <details><summary>Comme...</summary><p>Comments: Accepted at ICASSP 2025. 5 pages, 3 figures</p></details> |

Some skin diseases, such as Actinic Keratosis and Psoriasis, can be fatal if not treated in time. Early identification is crucial, but the diagnostic methods for these conditions are often expensive and not widely accessible. In this study, we propose a novel and efficient method for diagnosing skin diseases using deep learning techniques. This approach employs a modified VGG16 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The model includes several convolutional layers and utilizes ImageNet weights with modified top layers. The top layer is updated with fully connected layers and a final softmax activation layer to classify skin diseases. The dataset used, titled "Skin Disease Dataset," is publicly available. While the VGG16 architecture does not include data augmentation by default, preprocessing techniques such as rotation, shifting, and zooming were applied to augment the data prior to model training.

| **[One Transformer for All Time Series: Representing and Training with Time-Dependent Heterogeneous Tabular Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06375v3)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There is a recent growing interest in applying Deep Learning techniques to tabular data, in order to replicate the success of other Artificial Intelligence areas in this structured domain. Specifically interesting is the case in which tabular data have a time dependence, such as, for instance financial transactions. However, the heterogeneity of the tabular values, in which categorical elements are mixed with numerical items, makes this adaptation difficult. In this paper we propose a Transformer architecture to represent heterogeneous time-dependent tabular data, in which numerical features are represented using a set of frequency functions and the whole network is uniformly trained with a unique loss function.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 2 figures, 16 tables</p></details> |
| **[Regularizing cross entropy loss via minimum entropy and K-L divergence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13709v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>I introduce two novel loss functions for classification in deep learning. The two loss functions extend standard cross entropy loss by regularizing it with minimum entropy and Kullback-Leibler (K-L) divergence terms. The first of the two novel loss functions is termed mixed entropy loss (MIX-ENT for short), while the second one is termed minimum entropy regularized cross-entropy loss (MIN-ENT for short). The MIX-ENT function introduces a regularizer that can be shown to be equivalent to the sum of a minimum entropy term and a K-L divergence term. However, it should be noted that the K-L divergence term here is different from that in the standard cross-entropy loss function, in the sense that it swaps the roles of the target probability and the hypothesis probability. The MIN-ENT function simply adds a minimum entropy regularizer to the standard cross entropy loss function. In both MIX-ENT and MIN-ENT, the minimum entropy regularizer minimizes the entropy of the hypothesis probability distribution which is output by the neural network. Experiments on the EMNIST-Letters dataset shows that my implementation of MIX-ENT and MIN-ENT lets the VGG model climb from its previous 3rd position on the paperswithcode leaderboard to reach the 2nd position on the leaderboard, outperforming the Spinal-VGG model in so doing. Specifically, using standard cross-entropy, VGG achieves 95.86% while Spinal-VGG achieves 95.88% classification accuracies, whereas using VGG (without Spinal-VGG) our MIN-ENT achieved 95.933%, while our MIX-ENT achieved 95.927% accuracies. The pre-trained models for both MIX-ENT and MIN-ENT are at https://github.com/rahmanoladi/minimum entropy project.</p></details> | 5 pages |

| **[Learning Hemodynamic Scalar Fields on Coronary Artery Meshes: A Benchmark of Geometric Deep Learning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09046v2)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coronary artery disease, caused by the narrowing of coronary vessels due to atherosclerosis, is the leading cause of death worldwide. The diagnostic gold standard, fractional flow reserve (FFR), measures the trans-stenotic pressure ratio during maximal vasodilation but is invasive and costly. This has driven the development of virtual FFR (vFFR) using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to simulate coronary flow. Geometric deep learning algorithms have shown promise for learning features on meshes, including cardiovascular research applications. This study empirically analyzes various backends for predicting vFFR fields in coronary arteries as CFD surrogates, comparing six backends for learning hemodynamics on meshes using CFD solutions as ground truth. The study has two parts: i) Using 1,500 synthetic left coronary artery bifurcations, models were trained to predict pressure-related fields for vFFR reconstruction, comparing different learning variables. ii) Using 427 patient-specific CFD simulations, experiments were repeated focusing on the best-performing learning variable from the synthetic dataset. Most backends performed well on the synthetic dataset, especially when predicting pressure drop over the manifold. Transformer-based backends outperformed others when predicting pressure and vFFR fields and were the only models achieving strong performance on patient-specific data, excelling in both average per-point error and vFFR accuracy in stenotic lesions. These results suggest geometric deep learning backends can effectively replace CFD for simple geometries, while transformer-based networks are superior for complex, heterogeneous datasets. Pressure drop was identified as the optimal network output for learning pressure-related fields.</p></details> |  |

Physical attacks present a greater threat to deployed systems as adversaries can easily access the input channel, allowing them to provide malicious inputs to impersonate a victim. This paper addresses the limitations of existing projector-camera-based adversarial light attacks in practical FR setups. By incorporating device-aware adaptations into the digital attack algorithm, such as resolution-aware and color-aware adjustments, we mitigate the degradation from digital to physical domains. Experimental validation showcases the efficacy of our proposed algorithm against real and spoof adversaries, achieving high physical similarity scores in FR models and state-of-the-art commercial systems. On average, there is only a 14% reduction in scores from digital to physical attacks, with high attack success rate in both white- and black-box scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[HFGCN:Hypergraph Fusion Graph Convolutional Networks for Skeleton-Based Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11007v2)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, action recognition has received much attention and wide application due to its important role in video understanding. Most of the researches on action recognition methods focused on improving the performance via various deep learning methods rather than the classification of skeleton points. The topological modeling between skeleton points and body parts was seldom considered. Although some studies have used a data-driven approach to classify the topology of the skeleton point, the nature of the skeleton point in terms of kinematics has not been taken into consideration. Therefore, in this paper, we draw on the theory of kinematics to adapt the topological relations of the skeleton point and propose a topological relation classification based on body parts and distance from core of body. To synthesize these topological relations for action recognition, we propose a novel Hypergraph Fusion Graph Convolutional Network (HFGCN). In particular, the proposed model is able to focus on the human skeleton points and the different body parts simultaneously, and thus construct the topology, which improves the recognition accuracy obviously. We use a hypergraph to represent the categorical relationships of these skeleton points and incorporate the hypergraph into a graph convolution network to model the higher-order relationships among the skeleton points and enhance the feature representation of the network. In addition, our proposed hypergraph attention module and hypergraph graph convolution module optimize topology modeling in temporal and channel dimensions, respectively, to further enhance the feature representation of the network. We conducted extensive experiments on three widely used datasets.The results validate that our proposed method can achieve the best performance when compared with the state-of-the-art skeleton-based methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantification via Gaussian Latent Space Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13638v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantification, or prevalence estimation, is the task of predicting the prevalence of each class within an unknown bag of examples. Most existing quantification methods in the literature rely on prior probability shift assumptions to create a quantification model that uses the predictions of an underlying classifier to make optimal prevalence estimates. In this work, we present an end-to-end neural network that uses Gaussian distributions in latent spaces to obtain invariant representations of bags of examples. This approach addresses the quantification problem using deep learning, enabling the optimization of specific loss functions relevant to the problem and avoiding the need for an intermediate classifier, tackling the quantification problem as a direct optimization problem. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results, both against traditional quantification methods and other deep learning approaches for quantification. The code needed to reproduce all our experiments is publicly available at https://github.com/AICGijon/gmnet.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep-Relative-Trust-Based Diffusion for Decentralized Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03162v3)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decentralized learning strategies allow a collection of agents to learn efficiently from local data sets without the need for central aggregation or orchestration. Current decentralized learning paradigms typically rely on an averaging mechanism to encourage agreement in the parameter space. We argue that in the context of deep neural networks, which are often over-parameterized, encouraging consensus of the neural network outputs, as opposed to their parameters can be more appropriate. This motivates the development of a new decentralized learning algorithm, termed DRT diffusion, based on deep relative trust (DRT), a recently introduced similarity measure for neural networks. We provide convergence analysis for the proposed strategy, and numerically establish its benefit to generalization, especially with sparse topologies, in an image classification task.</p></details> |  |
| **[PaMMA-Net: Plasmas magnetic measurement evolution based on data-driven incremental accumulative prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14003v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An accurate evolution model is crucial for effective control and in-depth study of fusion plasmas. Evolution methods based on physical models often encounter challenges such as insufficient robustness or excessive computational costs. Given the proven strong fitting capabilities of deep learning methods across various fields, including plasma research, this paper introduces a deep learning-based magnetic measurement evolution method named PaMMA-Net (Plasma Magnetic Measurements Incremental Accumulative Prediction Network). This network is capable of evolving magnetic measurements in tokamak discharge experiments over extended periods or, in conjunction with equilibrium reconstruction algorithms, evolving macroscopic parameters such as plasma shape. Leveraging a incremental prediction approach and data augmentation techniques tailored for magnetic measurements, PaMMA-Net achieves superior evolution results compared to existing studies. The tests conducted on real experimental data from EAST validate the high generalization capability of the proposed method.</p></details> | 20 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Deep learning methods for stochastic Galerkin approximations of elliptic random PDEs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08063v2)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work considers stochastic Galerkin approximations of linear elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs) with stochastic forcing terms and stochastic diffusion coefficients, that cannot be bounded uniformly away from zero and infinity. A traditional numerical method for solving the resulting high-dimensional coupled system of PDEs is replaced by deep learning techniques. In order to achieve this, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), which typically operate on the strong residual of the PDE and can therefore be applied in a wide range of settings, are considered. As a second approach, the Deep Ritz method, which is a neural network that minimizes the Ritz energy functional to find the weak solution, is employed. While the second approach only works in special cases, it overcomes the necessity of testing in variational problems while maintaining mathematical rigor and ensuring the existence of a unique solution. Furthermore, the residual is of a lower differentiation order, reducing the training cost considerably. The efficiency of the method is demonstrated on several model problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[OmniHD-Scenes: A Next-Generation Multimodal Dataset for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10734v4)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of deep learning has intensified the need for comprehensive data for use by autonomous driving algorithms. High-quality datasets are crucial for the development of effective data-driven autonomous driving solutions. Next-generation autonomous driving datasets must be multimodal, incorporating data from advanced sensors that feature extensive data coverage, detailed annotations, and diverse scene representation. To address this need, we present OmniHD-Scenes, a large-scale multimodal dataset that provides comprehensive omnidirectional high-definition data. The OmniHD-Scenes dataset combines data from 128-beam LiDAR, six cameras, and six 4D imaging radar systems to achieve full environmental perception. The dataset comprises 1501 clips, each approximately 30-s long, totaling more than 450K synchronized frames and more than 5.85 million synchronized sensor data points. We also propose a novel 4D annotation pipeline. To date, we have annotated 200 clips with more than 514K precise 3D bounding boxes. These clips also include semantic segmentation annotations for static scene elements. Additionally, we introduce a novel automated pipeline for generation of the dense occupancy ground truth, which effectively leverages information from non-key frames. Alongside the proposed dataset, we establish comprehensive evaluation metrics, baseline models, and benchmarks for 3D detection and semantic occupancy prediction. These benchmarks utilize surround-view cameras and 4D imaging radar to explore cost-effective sensor solutions for autonomous driving applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our low-cost sensor configuration and its robustness under adverse conditions. Data will be released at https://www.2077ai.com/OmniHD-Scenes.</p></details> |  |
| **[CHaRNet: Conditioned Heatmap Regression for Robust Dental Landmark Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13073v2)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying anatomical landmarks in 3D dental models is crucial for orthodontic treatment. Manually placing these key points is complex, time-consuming, and requires expert knowledge. While some machine learning methods have been proposed for automatic tooth landmark detection in 3D Intraoral Scans (IOS), research remains limited, with no fully end-to-end approaches that avoid teeth segmentation. We propose CHaRNet (Conditioned Heatmap Regression Network), the first end-to-end deep learning method for tooth landmark detection in 3D IOS. Unlike traditional two-stage methods that segment teeth before detecting landmarks, CHaRNet directly detects landmarks on the input point cloud. It consists of four key modules: (1) a point cloud encoder, (2) a point cloud decoder with a heatmap regression head, (3) a teeth presence classification head, and (4) the innovative Conditioned Heatmap Regression (CHaR) module. The CHaR module refines landmark regression by leveraging teeth presence classification, enabling dynamic adaptation to cases with missing teeth and improving accuracy in complex dental models. We evaluate CHaRNet using five point cloud learning algorithms to validate the effectiveness of the CHaR module and test it on a clinical dataset of 1,214 annotated 3D dental models. Both the dataset and code will be publicly released to address the lack of open datasets in orthodontics, promote benchmarking, and inspire new research. CHaRNet achieves a Mean Euclidean Distance Error (MEDE) of 1.28 mm and a Mean Success Ratio (MSR) of 82.40%, demonstrating robust performance. Notably, it excels in handling irregular dental geometries, such as models with missing teeth. This end-to-end approach streamlines orthodontic workflows, improves 3D IOS analysis precision, and facilitates efficient computer-assisted treatment planning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Explainable AI-aided Feature Selection and Model Reduction for DRL-based V2X Resource Allocation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13552v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to significantly enhance radio resource management (RRM) in sixth-generation (6G) networks. However, the lack of explainability in complex deep learning (DL) models poses a challenge for practical implementation. This paper proposes a novel explainable AI (XAI)- based framework for feature selection and model complexity reduction in a model-agnostic manner. Applied to a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) setting, our approach addresses the joint sub-band assignment and power allocation problem in cellular vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications. We propose a novel two-stage systematic explainability framework leveraging feature relevance-oriented XAI to simplify the DRL agents. While the former stage generates a state feature importance ranking of the trained models using Shapley additive explanations (SHAP)-based importance scores, the latter stage exploits these importance-based rankings to simplify the state space of the agents by removing the least important features from the model input. Simulation results demonstrate that the XAI-assisted methodology achieves 97% of the original MADRL sum-rate performance while reducing optimal state features by 28%, average training time by 11%, and trainable weight parameters by 46% in a network with eight vehicular pairs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Propensity-driven Uncertainty Learning for Sample Exploration in Source-Free Active Domain Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13517v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Source-free active domain adaptation (SFADA) addresses the challenge of adapting a pre-trained model to new domains without access to source data while minimizing the need for target domain annotations. This scenario is particularly relevant in real-world applications where data privacy, storage limitations, or labeling costs are significant concerns. Key challenges in SFADA include selecting the most informative samples from the target domain for labeling, effectively leveraging both labeled and unlabeled target data, and adapting the model without relying on source domain information. Additionally, existing methods often struggle with noisy or outlier samples and may require impractical progressive labeling during training. To effectively select more informative samples without frequently requesting human annotations, we propose the Propensity-driven Uncertainty Learning (ProULearn) framework. ProULearn utilizes a novel homogeneity propensity estimation mechanism combined with correlation index calculation to evaluate feature-level relationships. This approach enables the identification of representative and challenging samples while avoiding noisy outliers. Additionally, we develop a central correlation loss to refine pseudo-labels and create compact class distributions during adaptation. In this way, ProULearn effectively bridges the domain gap and maximizes adaptation performance. The principles of informative sample selection underlying ProULearn have broad implications beyond SFADA, offering benefits across various deep learning tasks where identifying key data points or features is crucial. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that ProULearn outperforms state-of-the-art methods in domain adaptation scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Efficient Sparse Kernel Generator for O(3)-Equivariant Deep Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13986v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rotation equivariant graph neural networks, i.e., networks designed to guarantee certain geometric relations between their inputs and outputs, yield state-of-the-art performance on spatial deep learning tasks. They exhibit high data efficiency during training and significantly reduced inference time for interatomic potential calculations compared to classical approaches. Key to these models is the Clebsch-Gordon (CG) tensor product, a kernel that contracts two dense feature vectors with a highly structured sparse tensor to produce a dense output vector. The operation, which may be repeated millions of times for typical equivariant models, is a costly and inefficient bottleneck. We introduce a GPU sparse kernel generator for the CG tensor product that provides significant speedup over the best existing open and closed-source implementations. Our implementation achieves high performance by carefully managing GPU shared memory through static analysis at model compile-time, minimizing reads and writes to global memory. We break the tensor product into a series of kernels with operands that fit entirely into registers, enabling us to emit long arithmetic instruction streams that maximize instruction-level parallelism. By fusing the CG tensor product with a subsequent graph convolution, we reduce both intermediate storage and global memory traffic over naive approaches that duplicate input data. We also provide optimized kernels for the gradient of the CG tensor product and a novel identity for the higher partial derivatives required to predict interatomic forces. Our fused kernels offer up to 4.5x speedup for the forward pass and 3x for the backward pass over NVIDIA cuEquivariance, as well as >10x speedup over the widely-used e3nn package. We offer up to 5.3x inference-time speedup for the MACE chemistry foundation model over the original unoptimized version.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 9 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

While these approaches effectively detect partial obstructions and adapt to varying lighting conditions, their performance significantly diminishes when haze is present. This paper proposes a novel hybrid model with a pre-trained feature extractor and a Pinball Generalized Twin Support Vector Machine (Pin-GTSVM) classifier, which removes the need for a dehazing system from the current State-of-The-Art hazy parking slot classification systems and is also insensitive to any atmospheric noise. The proposed system can seamlessly integrate with conventional smart parking infrastructures, leveraging a minimal number of cameras to monitor and manage hundreds of parking spaces efficiently. Its effectiveness has been evaluated against established parking space detection methods using the CNRPark Patches, PKLot, and a custom dataset specific to hazy parking scenarios. Furthermore, empirical results indicate a significant improvement in accuracy on a hazy parking system, thus emphasizing efficient atmospheric noise handling.</p></details> |  |

Physical models and statistical techniques were the previous approaches employed for this kind of forecasting tasks. In forecasting renewable energy, machine learning and deep learning techniques have recently demonstrated encouraging results. More specifically, the deep learning techniques like CNN and LSTM and the conventional machine learning techniques like regression that are mostly utilized for load and renewable energy forecasting tasks.

With respect to deep learning models, YOLO is also the one that is evolving the most rapidly. Unfortunately, not every YOLO model possesses scholarly publications. Moreover, there exists a YOLO model that lacks a publicly accessible official architectural diagram. Naturally, this engenders challenges, such as complicating the understanding of how the model operates in practice.

We show the effectiveness of our model, where it demonstrates a high accuracy of 0.9134 and an AUC of 0.8656 to predict the NDWI. Additionally, we observe promising results with an R2 score of 0.4984 (for regressing the NDWI values) and a Mean IoU of 0.4139 (for the underlying segmentation task). In conclusion, our model offers a first and robust solution for generating NDWI images directly from Sentinel-1 images and subsequent use for various applications even under challenging conditions such as cloud cover and nighttime.</p></details> |  |
| **[Polyhedra Encoding Transformers: Enhancing Diffusion MRI Analysis Beyond Voxel and Volumetric Embedding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13352v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (dMRI) is an essential tool in neuroimaging. It is arguably the sole noninvasive technique for examining the microstructural properties and structural connectivity of the brain. Recent years have seen the emergence of machine learning and data-driven approaches that enhance the speed, accuracy, and consistency of dMRI data analysis. However, traditional deep learning models often fell short, as they typically utilize pixel-level or volumetric patch-level embeddings similar to those used in structural MRI, and do not account for the unique distribution of various gradient encodings. In this paper, we propose a novel method called Polyhedra Encoding Transformer (PE-Transformer) for dMRI, designed specifically to handle spherical signals. Our approach involves projecting an icosahedral polygon onto a unit sphere to resample signals from predetermined directions. These resampled signals are then transformed into embeddings, which are processed by a transformer encoder that incorporates orientational information reflective of the icosahedral structure. Through experimental validation with various gradient encoding protocols, our method demonstrates superior accuracy in estimating multi-compartment models and Fiber Orientation Distributions (FOD), outperforming both conventional CNN architectures and standard transformers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tensor-Var: Variational Data Assimilation in Tensor Product Feature Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13312v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Variational data assimilation estimates the dynamical system states by minimizing a cost function that fits the numerical models with observational data. The widely used method, four-dimensional variational assimilation (4D-Var), has two primary challenges: (1) computationally demanding for complex nonlinear systems and (2) relying on state-observation mappings, which are often not perfectly known. Deep learning (DL) has been used as a more expressive class of efficient model approximators to address these challenges. However, integrating such models into 4D-Var remains challenging due to their inherent nonlinearities and the lack of theoretical guarantees for consistency in assimilation results. In this paper, we propose \textit{Tensor-Var} to address these challenges using kernel Conditional Mean Embedding (CME). Tensor-Var improves optimization efficiency by characterizing system dynamics and state-observation mappings as linear operators, leading to a convex cost function in the feature space. Furthermore, our method provides a new perspective to incorporate CME into 4D-Var, offering theoretical guarantees of consistent assimilation results between the original and feature spaces. To improve scalability, we propose a method to learn deep features (DFs) using neural networks within the Tensor-Var framework. Experiments on chaotic systems and global weather prediction with real-time observations show that Tensor-Var outperforms conventional and DL hybrid 4D-Var baselines in accuracy while achieving efficiency comparable to the static 3D-Var method.</p></details> |  |

In connectionist systems, the field of disentanglement has gained prominence for its ability to produce explicitly compositional representations; however, it relies on a fundamentally symbolic, concatenative representation of compositional structure that clashes with the continuous, distributed foundations of deep learning. To resolve this tension, we extend Smolensky's Tensor Product Representation (TPR) and introduce Soft TPR, a representational form that encodes compositional structure in an inherently distributed, flexible manner, along with Soft TPR Autoencoder, a theoretically-principled architecture designed specifically to learn Soft TPRs. Comprehensive evaluations in the visual representation learning domain demonstrate that the Soft TPR framework consistently outperforms conventional disentanglement alternatives -- achieving state-of-the-art disentanglement, boosting representation learner convergence, and delivering superior sample efficiency and low-sample regime performance in downstream tasks. These findings highlight the promise of a distributed and flexible approach to representing compositional structure by potentially enhancing alignment with the core principles of deep learning over the conventional symbolic approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Neurips 2024. 10 pages + supplementary</p></details> |

We developed two distinct CAE architectures to process simulated STM images of simple cubic, body-centered cubic (BCC), face-centered cubic (FCC), and hexagonal lattices. Our models were trained on $17\times17$ pixel patches extracted from $256\times256$ simulated STM images, incorporating realistic noise characteristics. We evaluated the models' performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Structural Similarity (SSIM) index, and analyzed the learned latent space representations. The results demonstrate the potential of deep learning techniques in STM image analysis, while also highlighting challenges in latent space interpretability and full image reconstruction. This work lays the foundation for future advancements in automated analysis of atomic-scale imaging data, with potential applications in materials science and nanotechnology.</p></details> | 18 pages |
| **[Hybrid Two-Stage Reconstruction of Multiscale Subsurface Flow with Physics-informed Residual Connected Neural Operator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13271v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The novel neural networks show great potential in solving partial differential equations. For single-phase flow problems in subsurface porous media with high-contrast coefficients, the key is to develop neural operators with accurate reconstruction capability and strict adherence to physical laws. In this study, we proposed a hybrid two-stage framework that uses multiscale basis functions and physics-guided deep learning to solve the Darcy flow problem in high-contrast fractured porous media. In the first stage, a data-driven model is used to reconstruct the multiscale basis function based on the permeability field to achieve effective dimensionality reduction while preserving the necessary multiscale features. In the second stage, the physics-informed neural network, together with Transformer-based global information extractor is used to reconstruct the pressure field by integrating the physical constraints derived from the Darcy equation, ensuring consistency with the physical laws of the real world. The model was evaluated on datasets with different combinations of permeability and basis functions and performed well in terms of reconstruction accuracy. Specifically, the framework achieves R2 values above 0.9 in terms of basis function fitting and pressure reconstruction, and the residual indicator is on the order of $1\times 10^{-4}$. These results validate the ability of the proposed framework to achieve accurate reconstruction while maintaining physical consistency.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 14 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

We present a sequence-invariant self-supervised framework leveraging quantitative MRI (qMRI). By simulating multiple MRI contrasts from a single 3D qMRI scan and enforcing consistent representations across these contrasts, we learn anatomy-centric rather than sequence-specific features. This yields a robust 3D encoder that performs strongly across varied tasks and protocols. Experiments on healthy brain segmentation (IXI), stroke lesion segmentation (ARC), and MRI denoising show significant gains over baseline SSL approaches, especially in low-data settings (up to +8.3% Dice, +4.2 dB PSNR). Our model also generalises effectively to unseen sites, demonstrating potential for more scalable and clinically reliable volumetric analysis. All code and trained models are publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[DCT-CryptoNets: Scaling Private Inference in the Frequency Domain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15231v2)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The convergence of fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) and machine learning offers unprecedented opportunities for private inference of sensitive data. FHE enables computation directly on encrypted data, safeguarding the entire machine learning pipeline, including data and model confidentiality. However, existing FHE-based implementations for deep neural networks face significant challenges in computational cost, latency, and scalability, limiting their practical deployment. This paper introduces DCT-CryptoNets, a novel approach that operates directly in the frequency-domain to reduce the burden of computationally expensive non-linear activations and homomorphic bootstrap operations during private inference. It does so by utilizing the discrete cosine transform (DCT), commonly employed in JPEG encoding, which has inherent compatibility with remote computing services where images are generally stored and transmitted in this encoded format. DCT-CryptoNets demonstrates a substantial latency reductions of up to 5.3$\times$ compared to prior work on benchmark image classification tasks. Notably, it demonstrates inference on the ImageNet dataset within 2.5 hours (down from 12.5 hours on equivalent 96-thread compute resources). Furthermore, by learning perceptually salient low-frequency information DCT-CryptoNets improves the reliability of encrypted predictions compared to RGB-based networks by reducing error accumulating homomorphic bootstrap operations. DCT-CryptoNets also demonstrates superior scalability to RGB-based networks by further reducing computational cost as image size increases. This study demonstrates a promising avenue for achieving efficient and practical private inference of deep learning models on high resolution images seen in real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025; 10 pages content, 5 pages appendix, 4 figures, 9 tables; Code @ https://github.com/ar-roy/dct-cryptonets</p></details> |
| **[Stochastic Deep Learning Surrogate Models for Uncertainty Propagation in Microstructure-Properties of Ceramic Aerogels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13255v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning surrogate models have become pivotal in enabling model-driven materials discovery to achieve exceptional properties. However, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of predictions from these models, trained on limited and sparse material datasets remains a significant challenge. This study introduces an integrated deep learning framework for predicting the synthesis, microstructure, and mechanical properties of ceramic aerogels, leveraging physics-based models such as Lattice Boltzmann simulations for microstructure formation and stochastic finite element methods for mechanical property calculations. To address the computational demands of repeated physics-based simulations required for experimental calibration and material design, a linked surrogate model is developed, leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for stochastic microstructure generation and microstructure-to-mechanical property mapping. To overcome challenges associated with limited training datasets from expensive physical modeling, CNN training is formulated within a Bayesian inference framework, enabling robust uncertainty quantification in predictions. Numerical results highlight the strengths and limitations of the linked surrogate framework, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting properties of aerogels with pore sizes and morphologies similar to the training data (in-distribution) and its ability to interpolate to new microstructural features between training data (out-of-distribution).</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalizable and Robust Spectral Method for Multi-view Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02138v2)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-view representation learning (MvRL) has garnered substantial attention in recent years, driven by the increasing demand for applications that can effectively process and analyze data from multiple sources. In this context, graph Laplacian-based MvRL methods have demonstrated remarkable success in representing multi-view data. However, these methods often struggle with generalization to new data and face challenges with scalability. Moreover, in many practical scenarios, multi-view data is contaminated by noise or outliers. In such cases, modern deep-learning-based MvRL approaches that rely on alignment or contrastive objectives present degraded performance in downstream tasks, as they may impose incorrect consistency between clear and corrupted data sources. We introduce $\textit{SpecRaGE}$, a novel fusion-based framework that integrates the strengths of graph Laplacian methods with the power of deep learning to overcome these challenges. SpecRage uses neural networks to learn parametric mapping that approximates a joint diagonalization of graph Laplacians. This solution bypasses the need for alignment while enabling generalizable and scalable learning of informative and meaningful representations. Moreover, it incorporates a meta-learning fusion module that dynamically adapts to data quality, ensuring robustness against outliers and noisy views. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that SpecRaGE outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in scenarios with data contamination, paving the way for more reliable and efficient multi-view learning.</p></details> |  |

These patterns arise in sequential data, such as video frames, which are often essential to accurately distinguish actions that would be ambiguous in a single image. HAR has garnered considerable interest due to its broad applicability, ranging from robotics and surveillance systems to sports motion analysis, healthcare, and the burgeoning field of autonomous vehicles. While several taxonomies have been proposed to categorize HAR approaches in surveys, they often overlook hybrid methodologies and fail to demonstrate how different models incorporate various architectures and modalities. In this comprehensive survey, we present the novel SMART-Vision taxonomy, which illustrates how innovations in deep learning for HAR complement one another, leading to hybrid approaches beyond traditional categories. Our survey provides a clear roadmap from foundational HAR works to current state-of-the-art systems, highlighting emerging research directions and addressing unresolved challenges in discussion sections for architectures within the HAR domain. We provide details of the research datasets that various approaches used to measure and compare goodness HAR approaches. We also explore the rapidly emerging field of Open-HAR systems, which challenges HAR systems by presenting samples from unknown, novel classes during test time.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we examine the consistency of responses provided by LLMs to health-related questions across English, German, Turkish, and Chinese. We largely expand the HealthFC dataset by categorizing health-related questions by disease type and broadening its multilingual scope with Turkish and Chinese translations. We reveal significant inconsistencies in responses that could spread healthcare misinformation. Our main contributions are 1) a multilingual health-related inquiry dataset with meta-information on disease categories, and 2) a novel prompt-based evaluation workflow that enables sub-dimensional comparisons between two languages through parsing. Our findings highlight key challenges in deploying LLM-based tools in multilingual contexts and emphasize the need for improved cross-lingual alignment to ensure accurate and equitable healthcare information.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages.

| **[An Empirical Study on LLM-based Classification of Requirements-related Provisions in Food-safety Regulations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14683v1)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Industry 4.0 transforms the food industry, the role of software in achieving compliance with food-safety regulations is becoming increasingly critical. Food-safety regulations, like those in many legal domains, have largely been articulated in a technology-independent manner to ensure their longevity and broad applicability. However, this approach leaves a gap between the regulations and the modern systems and software increasingly used to implement them. In this article, we pursue two main goals. First, we conduct a Grounded Theory study of food-safety regulations and develop a conceptual characterization of food-safety concepts that closely relate to systems and software requirements. Second, we examine the effectiveness of two families of large language models (LLMs) -- BERT and GPT -- in automatically classifying legal provisions based on requirements-related food-safety concepts. Our results show that: (a) when fine-tuned, the accuracy differences between the best-performing models in the BERT and GPT families are relatively small. Nevertheless, the most powerful model in our experiments, GPT-4o, still achieves the highest accuracy, with an average Precision of 89% and an average Recall of 87%; (b) few-shot learning with GPT-4o increases Recall to 97% but decreases Precision to 65%, suggesting a trade-off between fine-tuning and few-shot learning; (c) despite our training examples being drawn exclusively from Canadian regulations, LLM-based classification performs consistently well on test provisions from the US, indicating a degree of generalizability across regulatory jurisdictions; and (d) for our classification task, LLMs significantly outperform simpler baselines constructed using long short-term memory (LSTM) networks and automatic keyword extraction.</p></details> |  |
| **[MedAgentBench: Dataset for Benchmarking LLMs as Agents in Medical Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14654v1)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant advancements, particularly in their ability to serve as agents thereby surpassing their traditional role as chatbots. These agents can leverage their planning and tool utilization capabilities to address tasks specified at a high level. However, a standardized dataset to benchmark the agent capabilities of LLMs in medical applications is currently lacking, making the evaluation of LLMs on complex tasks in interactive healthcare environments challenging. To address this gap, we introduce MedAgentBench, a broad evaluation suite designed to assess the agent capabilities of large language models within medical records contexts. MedAgentBench encompasses 100 patient-specific clinically-derived tasks from 10 categories written by human physicians, realistic profiles of 100 patients with over 700,000 data elements, a FHIR-compliant interactive environment, and an accompanying codebase. The environment uses the standard APIs and communication infrastructure used in modern EMR systems, so it can be easily migrated into live EMR systems. MedAgentBench presents an unsaturated agent-oriented benchmark that current state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit some ability to succeed at. The best model (GPT-4o) achieves a success rate of 72%. However, there is still substantial space for improvement to give the community a next direction to optimize. Furthermore, there is significant variation in performance across task categories. MedAgentBench establishes this and is publicly available at https://github.com/stanfordmlgroup/MedAgentBench , offering a valuable framework for model developers to track progress and drive continuous improvements in the agent capabilities of large language models within the medical domain.</p></details> |  |
| **[Extracting Problem Structure with LLMs for Optimized SAT Local Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14630v1)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Local search preprocessing makes Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL) solvers faster by providing high-quality starting points and modern SAT solvers have incorporated this technique into their preprocessing steps. However, these tools rely on basic strategies that miss the structural patterns in problems. We present a method that applies Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze Python-based encoding code. This reveals hidden structural patterns in how problems convert into SAT. Our method automatically generates specialized local search algorithms that find these patterns and use them to create strong initial assignments. This works for any problem instance from the same encoding type. Our tests show encouraging results, achieving faster solving times compared to baseline preprocessing systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[LaMSUM: Amplifying Voices Against Harassment through LLM Guided Extractive Summarization of User Incident Reports](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15809v4)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Citizen reporting platforms like Safe City in India help the public and authorities stay informed about sexual harassment incidents. However, the high volume of data shared on these platforms makes reviewing each individual case challenging. Therefore, a summarization algorithm capable of processing and understanding various Indian code-mixed languages is essential. In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown exceptional performance in NLP tasks, including summarization. LLMs inherently produce abstractive summaries by paraphrasing the original text, while the generation of extractive summaries - selecting specific subsets from the original text - through LLMs remains largely unexplored. Moreover, LLMs have a limited context window size, restricting the amount of data that can be processed at once. We tackle these challenge by introducing LaMSUM, a novel multi-level framework designed to generate extractive summaries for large collections of Safe City posts using LLMs. LaMSUM integrates summarization with different voting methods to achieve robust summaries. Extensive evaluation using three popular LLMs (Llama, Mistral and GPT-4o) demonstrates that LaMSUM outperforms state-of-the-art extractive summarization methods for Safe City posts. Overall, this work represents one of the first attempts to achieve extractive summarization through LLMs, and is likely to support stakeholders by offering a comprehensive overview and enabling them to develop effective policies to minimize incidents of unwarranted harassment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Accelerated Preference Elicitation with LLM-Based Proxies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14625v1)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bidders in combinatorial auctions face significant challenges when describing their preferences to an auctioneer. Classical work on preference elicitation focuses on query-based techniques inspired from proper learning--often via proxies that interface between bidders and an auction mechanism--to incrementally learn bidder preferences as needed to compute efficient allocations. Although such elicitation mechanisms enjoy theoretical query efficiency, the amount of communication required may still be too cognitively taxing in practice. We propose a family of efficient LLM-based proxy designs for eliciting preferences from bidders using natural language. Our proposed mechanism combines LLM pipelines and DNF-proper-learning techniques to quickly approximate preferences when communication is limited. To validate our approach, we create a testing sandbox for elicitation mechanisms that communicate in natural language. In our experiments, our most promising LLM proxy design reaches approximately efficient outcomes with five times fewer queries than classical proper learning based elicitation mechanisms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Human-Guided, Data-Centric LLM Co-Pilots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10321v2)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning (ML) has the potential to revolutionize various domains, but its adoption is often hindered by the disconnect between the needs of domain experts and translating these needs into robust and valid ML tools. Despite recent advances in LLM-based co-pilots to democratize ML for non-technical domain experts, these systems remain predominantly focused on model-centric aspects while overlooking critical data-centric challenges. This limitation is problematic in complex real-world settings where raw data often contains complex issues, such as missing values, label noise, and domain-specific nuances requiring tailored handling. To address this we introduce CliMB-DC, a human-guided, data-centric framework for LLM co-pilots that combines advanced data-centric tools with LLM-driven reasoning to enable robust, context-aware data processing. At its core, CliMB-DC introduces a novel, multi-agent reasoning system that combines a strategic coordinator for dynamic planning and adaptation with a specialized worker agent for precise execution. Domain expertise is then systematically incorporated to guide the reasoning process using a human-in-the-loop approach. To guide development, we formalize a taxonomy of key data-centric challenges that co-pilots must address. Thereafter, to address the dimensions of the taxonomy, we integrate state-of-the-art data-centric tools into an extensible, open-source architecture, facilitating the addition of new tools from the research community. Empirically, using real-world healthcare datasets we demonstrate CliMB-DC's ability to transform uncurated datasets into ML-ready formats, significantly outperforming existing co-pilot baselines for handling data-centric challenges. CliMB-DC promises to empower domain experts from diverse domains -- healthcare, finance, social sciences and more -- to actively participate in driving real-world impact using ML.</p></details> | <details><summary>Savel...</summary><p>Saveliev, Liu & Seedat contributed equally</p></details> |
| **[An Investigation of Prompt Variations for Zero-shot LLM-based Rankers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14117v3)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We provide a systematic understanding of the impact of specific components and wordings used in prompts on the effectiveness of rankers based on zero-shot Large Language Models (LLMs). Several zero-shot ranking methods based on LLMs have recently been proposed. Among many aspects, methods differ across (1) the ranking algorithm they implement, e.g., pointwise vs. listwise, (2) the backbone LLMs used, e.g., GPT3.5 vs. FLAN-T5, (3) the components and wording used in prompts, e.g., the use or not of role-definition (role-playing) and the actual words used to express this. It is currently unclear whether performance differences are due to the underlying ranking algorithm, or because of spurious factors such as better choice of words used in prompts. This confusion risks to undermine future research. Through our large-scale experimentation and analysis, we find that ranking algorithms do contribute to differences between methods for zero-shot LLM ranking. However, so do the LLM backbones -- but even more importantly, the choice of prompt components and wordings affect the ranking. In fact, in our experiments, we find that, at times, these latter elements have more impact on the ranker's effectiveness than the actual ranking algorithms, and that differences among ranking methods become more blurred when prompt variations are considered.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-playing Adversarial Language Game Enhances LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10642v3)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We explore the potential of self-play training for large language models (LLMs) in a two-player adversarial language game called Adversarial Taboo. In this game, an attacker and a defender communicate around a target word only visible to the attacker. The attacker aims to induce the defender to speak the target word unconsciously, while the defender tries to infer the target word from the attacker's utterances. To win the game, both players must have sufficient knowledge about the target word and high-level reasoning ability to infer and express in this information-reserved conversation. Hence, we are curious about whether LLMs' reasoning ability can be further enhanced by Self-Playing this Adversarial language Game (SPAG). With this goal, we select several open-source LLMs and let each act as the attacker and play with a copy of itself as the defender on an extensive range of target words. Through reinforcement learning on the game outcomes, we observe that the LLMs' performances uniformly improve on a broad range of reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore, iteratively adopting this self-play process can continuously promote LLMs' reasoning abilities. The code is available at https://github.com/Linear95/SPAG.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

However, current approaches face significant limitations, including poor generalizability due to task-specific prompts, inefficiencies caused by the lack of separation between knowledge and queries, and restricted inferential capabilities. These shortcomings hinder their scalability and applicability across diverse domains. In this paper, we introduce VERUS-LM, a novel framework designed to address these challenges. VERUS-LM employs a generic prompting mechanism, clearly separates domain knowledge from queries, and supports a wide range of different logical reasoning tasks. This framework enhances adaptability, reduces computational cost, and allows for richer forms of reasoning, such as optimization and constraint satisfaction. We show that our approach succeeds in diverse reasoning on a novel dataset, markedly outperforming LLMs. Additionally, our system achieves competitive results on common reasoning benchmarks when compared to other state-of-the-art approaches, and significantly surpasses them on the difficult AR-LSAT dataset. By pushing the boundaries of hybrid reasoning, VERUS-LM represents a significant step towards more versatile neurosymbolic AI systems</p></details> |  |
| **[RoboHorizon: An LLM-Assisted Multi-View World Model for Long-Horizon Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06605v3)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient control in long-horizon robotic manipulation is challenging due to complex representation and policy learning requirements. Model-based visual reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great potential in addressing these challenges but still faces notable limitations, particularly in handling sparse rewards and complex visual features in long-horizon environments. To address these limitations, we propose the Recognize-Sense-Plan-Act (RSPA) pipeline for long-horizon tasks and further introduce RoboHorizon, an LLM-assisted multi-view world model tailored for long-horizon robotic manipulation. In RoboHorizon, pre-trained LLMs generate dense reward structures for multi-stage sub-tasks based on task language instructions, enabling robots to better recognize long-horizon tasks. Keyframe discovery is then integrated into the multi-view masked autoencoder (MAE) architecture to enhance the robot's ability to sense critical task sequences, strengthening its multi-stage perception of long-horizon processes. Leveraging these dense rewards and multi-view representations, a robotic world model is constructed to efficiently plan long-horizon tasks, enabling the robot to reliably act through RL algorithms. Experiments on two representative benchmarks, RLBench and FurnitureBench, show that RoboHorizon outperforms state-of-the-art visual model-based RL methods, achieving a 23.35% improvement in task success rates on RLBench's 4 short-horizon tasks and a 29.23% improvement on 6 long-horizon tasks from RLBench and 3 furniture assembly tasks from FurnitureBench.</p></details> | Under review |

Traditional methods for boundary value test input generation can be time-consuming and may struggle to address all potential error cases effectively, especially in systems with intricate or highly variable boundaries. This paper presents a framework for assessing the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) in generating boundary value test inputs for white-box software testing by examining their potential through prompt engineering. Specifically, we evaluate the effectiveness of LLM-based test input generation by analyzing fault detection rates and test coverage, comparing these LLM-generated test sets with those produced using traditional boundary value analysis methods. Our analysis shows the strengths and limitations of LLMs in boundary value generation, particularly in detecting common boundary-related issues. However, they still face challenges in certain areas, especially when handling complex or less common test inputs. This research provides insights into the role of LLMs in boundary value testing, underscoring both their potential and areas for improvement in automated testing methods.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods to mitigate bias lack a comprehensive understanding of its mechanisms or compromise the model's core capabilities. To address these issues, we propose the CommonWords dataset, to systematically evaluate gender bias in LLMs. Our analysis reveals pervasive bias across models and identifies specific neuron circuits, including gender neurons and general neurons, responsible for this behavior. Notably, editing even a small number of general neurons can disrupt the model's overall capabilities due to hierarchical neuron interactions. Based on these insights, we propose an interpretable neuron editing method that combines logit-based and causal-based strategies to selectively target biased neurons. Experiments on five LLMs demonstrate that our method effectively reduces gender bias while preserving the model's original capabilities, outperforming existing fine-tuning and editing approaches. Our findings contribute a novel dataset, a detailed analysis of bias mechanisms, and a practical solution for mitigating gender bias in LLMs.</p></details> | preprint |

However, current LLMs for high-stakes domain tasks, such as financial investment and legal QA, typically generate brief answers without reasoning processes and explanations. This limits users' confidence in making decisions based on their responses. While original CoT shows promise, it lacks self-correction mechanisms during reasoning. This work introduces Domain$o1$s, which enhances LLMs' reasoning capabilities on domain tasks through supervised fine-tuning and tree search. We construct CoT-stock-2k and CoT-legal-2k datasets for fine-tuning models that activate domain-specific reasoning steps based on their judgment. Additionally, we propose Selective Tree Exploration to spontaneously explore solution spaces and sample optimal reasoning paths to improve performance. We also introduce PROOF-Score, a new metric for evaluating domain models' explainability, complementing traditional accuracy metrics with richer assessment dimensions. Extensive experiments on stock investment recommendation and legal reasoning QA tasks demonstrate Domaino1s's leading performance and explainability.

| **[GraphBC: Improving LLMs for Better Graph Data Processing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14427v1)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The success of Large Language Models (LLMs) in various domains has led researchers to apply them to graph-related problems by converting graph data into natural language text. However, unlike graph data, natural language inherently has sequential order. We observe that when the order of nodes or edges in the natural language description of a graph is shuffled, despite describing the same graph, model performance fluctuates between high performance and random guessing. Additionally, due to the limited input context length of LLMs, current methods typically randomly sample neighbors of target nodes as representatives of their neighborhood, which may not always be effective for accurate reasoning. To address these gaps, we introduce GraphBC. This novel model framework features an Order Selector Module to ensure proper serialization order of the graph and a Subgraph Sampling Module to sample subgraphs with better structure for better reasoning. Furthermore, we propose Graph CoT obtained through distillation, and enhance LLM's reasoning and zero-shot learning capabilities for graph tasks through instruction tuning. Experiments on multiple datasets for node classification and graph question-answering demonstrate that GraphBC improves LLMs' performance and generalization ability on graph tasks.</p></details> |  |

In response, we introduce iLLuMinaTE, a zero-shot, chain-of-prompts LLM-XAI pipeline inspired by Miller's cognitive model of explanation. iLLuMinaTE is designed to deliver theory-driven, actionable feedback to students in online courses. iLLuMinaTE navigates three main stages - causal connection, explanation selection, and explanation presentation - with variations drawing from eight social science theories (e.g. Abnormal Conditions, Pearl's Model of Explanation, Necessity and Robustness Selection, Contrastive Explanation). We extensively evaluate 21,915 natural language explanations of iLLuMinaTE extracted from three LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemma2-9B, Llama3-70B), with three different underlying XAI methods (LIME, Counterfactuals, MC-LIME), across students from three diverse online courses. Our evaluation involves analyses of explanation alignment to the social science theory, understandability of the explanation, and a real-world user preference study with 114 university students containing a novel actionability simulation.

| **[DRESSing Up LLM: Efficient Stylized Question-Answering via Style Subspace Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14371v1)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce DRESS, a novel approach for generating stylized large language model (LLM) responses through representation editing. Existing methods like prompting and fine-tuning are either insufficient for complex style adaptation or computationally expensive, particularly in tasks like NPC creation or character role-playing. Our approach leverages the over-parameterized nature of LLMs to disentangle a style-relevant subspace within the model's representation space to conduct representation editing, ensuring a minimal impact on the original semantics. By applying adaptive editing strengths, we dynamically adjust the steering vectors in the style subspace to maintain both stylistic fidelity and semantic integrity. We develop two stylized QA benchmark datasets to validate the effectiveness of DRESS, and the results demonstrate significant improvements compared to baseline methods such as prompting and ITI. In short, DRESS is a lightweight, train-free solution for enhancing LLMs with flexible and effective style control, making it particularly useful for developing stylized conversational agents.

FireRedASR comprises two variants: FireRedASR-LLM: Designed to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and to enable seamless end-to-end speech interaction. It adopts an Encoder-Adapter-LLM framework leveraging large language model (LLM) capabilities. On public Mandarin benchmarks, FireRedASR-LLM (8.3B parameters) achieves an average Character Error Rate (CER) of 3.05%, surpassing the latest SOTA of 3.33% with an 8.4% relative CER reduction (CERR). It demonstrates superior generalization capability over industrial-grade baselines, achieving 24%-40% CERR in multi-source Mandarin ASR scenarios such as video, live, and intelligent assistant. FireRedASR-AED: Designed to balance high performance and computational efficiency and to serve as an effective speech representation module in LLM-based speech models. It utilizes an Attention-based Encoder-Decoder (AED) architecture. On public Mandarin benchmarks, FireRedASR-AED (1.1B parameters) achieves an average CER of 3.18%, slightly worse than FireRedASR-LLM but still outperforming the latest SOTA model with over 12B parameters. It offers a more compact size, making it suitable for resource-constrained applications. Moreover, both models exhibit competitive results on Chinese dialects and English speech benchmarks and excel in singing lyrics recognition. To advance research in speech processing, we release our models and inference code at https://github.com/FireRedTeam/FireRedASR.</p></details> |  |
| **[Moral Alignment for LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01639v3)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decision-making agents based on pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed across various domains of human activity. While their applications are currently rather specialized, several research efforts are under way to develop more generalist agents. As LLM-based systems become more agentic, their influence on human activity will grow and the transparency of this will decrease. Consequently, developing effective methods for aligning them to human values is vital. The prevailing practice in alignment often relies on human preference data (e.g., in RLHF or DPO), in which values are implicit and are essentially deduced from relative preferences over different model outputs. In this work, instead of relying on human feedback, we introduce the design of reward functions that explicitly encode core human values for Reinforcement Learning-based fine-tuning of foundation agent models. Specifically, we use intrinsic rewards for the moral alignment of LLM agents. We evaluate our approach using the traditional philosophical frameworks of Deontological Ethics and Utilitarianism, quantifying moral rewards for agents in terms of actions and consequences on the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) environment. We also show how moral fine-tuning can be deployed to enable an agent to unlearn a previously developed selfish strategy. Finally, we find that certain moral strategies learned on the IPD game generalize to several other matrix game environments. In summary, we demonstrate that fine-tuning with intrinsic rewards is a promising general solution for aligning LLM agents to human values, and it might represent a more transparent and cost-effective alternative to currently predominant alignment techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at the 13th International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR'25), Singapore, Apr 2025</p></details> |

Deep learning has been used more and more recently in software engineering, particularly for tasks like code creation and summarization. Specifically, it appears that the most current Large Language Models with coding perform well on these tasks. Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the field of code summarization, providing sophisticated methods for generating concise and accurate summaries of source code. This study aims to perform a comparative analysis of several open-source LLMs, namely LLaMA-3, Phi-3, Mistral, and Gemma. These models' performance is assessed using important metrics such as BLEU\textsubscript{3.1} and ROUGE\textsubscript{3.2}. Through this analysis, we seek to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each model, offering insights into their applicability and effectiveness in code summarization tasks. Our findings contribute to the ongoing development and refinement of LLMs, supporting their integration into tools that enhance software development and maintenance processes.</p></details> |  |

Recent research suggests using Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the annotation process, reducing these costs while maintaining data quality. LLMs have shown promising results in annotating downstream tasks like hate speech detection and political framing. Building on the success in these areas, this study investigates whether LLMs are viable for annotating the complex task of media bias detection and whether a downstream media bias classifier can be trained on such data. We create annolexical, the first large-scale dataset for media bias classification with over 48000 synthetically annotated examples. Our classifier, fine-tuned on this dataset, surpasses all of the annotator LLMs by 5-9 percent in Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) and performs close to or outperforms the model trained on human-labeled data when evaluated on two media bias benchmark datasets (BABE and BASIL). This study demonstrates how our approach significantly reduces the cost of dataset creation in the media bias domain and, by extension, the development of classifiers, while our subsequent behavioral stress-testing reveals some of its current limitations and trade-offs.</p></details> |  |

A Study of Token Perplexity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14315v1)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Maintaining consistent model performance across domains is a fundamental challenge in machine learning. While recent work has explored using LLM-generated data for fine-tuning, its impact on cross-domain generalization remains poorly understood. In this paper, we present a systematic analysis revealing that fine-tuning with LLM-generated data not only improves target task performance but also reduces out-of-domain (OOD) degradation compared to fine-tuning with ground truth data. Through analyzing the data sequence in tasks of various domains, we demonstrate that this enhanced OOD robustness stems from a reduced prevalence of high perplexity tokens in LLM-generated sequences. Following this hypothesis we showed that masking high perplexity tokens in ground truth training data also achieves similar OOD preservation comparable to using LLM-generated data. Extensive experiments across diverse model architectures and scales, including Gemma2-2B, Mistral-7B and Llama3-8B, corroborate the consistency of our findings. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides the first mechanistic explanation for the superior OOD robustness conferred by LLM-generated training data, offering valuable insights for developing more robust fine-tuning strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[COAST: Enhancing the Code Debugging Ability of LLMs through Communicative Agent Based Data Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05006v2)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code debugging is a vital stage of software development, essential for ensuring the reliability and performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in code generation task. Human debugging typically follows a multi-stage process, which includes Bug Localization, Bug Identification, Code Repair, and Code Recognition. However, existing code debugging benchmarks predominantly focus on the Code Repair stage, which offers only a limited perspective on evaluating the debugging capabilities of LLMs. In this paper, we introduce DEBUGEVAL, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the debugging abilities of LLMs by emulating the multi-stage human debugging process. Through evaluating on DEBUGEVAL, we observe that 7B-scale models consistently underperform compared to their larger counterparts, highlighting their limitations in comprehending code semantics. In this case, we propose the COmmunicative Agent-based data SynThesis (COAST) framework, which employs a multi-agent system to generate high-quality training data for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Experimental results demonstrate that COAST-generated data outperform human-curated and GPT-4-generated data, enabling 7B-scale LLMs to achieve debugging performance comparable to GPT-3.5.</p></details> |  |
| **[Locality-aware Fair Scheduling in LLM Serving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14312v1)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) inference workload dominates a wide variety of modern AI applications, ranging from multi-turn conversation to document analysis. Balancing fairness and efficiency is critical for managing diverse client workloads with varying prefix patterns. Unfortunately, existing fair scheduling algorithms for LLM serving, such as Virtual Token Counter (VTC), fail to take prefix locality into consideration and thus suffer from poor performance. On the other hand, locality-aware scheduling algorithms in existing LLM serving frameworks tend to maximize the prefix cache hit rate without considering fair sharing among clients. This paper introduces the first locality-aware fair scheduling algorithm, Deficit Longest Prefix Match (DLPM), which can maintain a high degree of prefix locality with a fairness guarantee. We also introduce a novel algorithm, Double Deficit LPM (D$^2$LPM), extending DLPM for the distributed setup that can find a balance point among fairness, locality, and load-balancing. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates the superior performance of DLPM and D$^2$LPM in ensuring fairness while maintaining high throughput (up to 2.87$\times$ higher than VTC) and low per-client (up to 7.18$\times$ lower than state-of-the-art distributed LLM serving system) latency.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Zero-Shot LLM Framework for Automatic Assignment Grading in Higher Education](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14305v1)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated grading has become an essential tool in education technology due to its ability to efficiently assess large volumes of student work, provide consistent and unbiased evaluations, and deliver immediate feedback to enhance learning. However, current systems face significant limitations, including the need for large datasets in few-shot learning methods, a lack of personalized and actionable feedback, and an overemphasis on benchmark performance rather than student experience. To address these challenges, we propose a Zero-Shot Large Language Model (LLM)-Based Automated Assignment Grading (AAG) system. This framework leverages prompt engineering to evaluate both computational and explanatory student responses without requiring additional training or fine-tuning. The AAG system delivers tailored feedback that highlights individual strengths and areas for improvement, thereby enhancing student learning outcomes. Our study demonstrates the system's effectiveness through comprehensive evaluations, including survey responses from higher education students that indicate significant improvements in motivation, understanding, and preparedness compared to traditional grading methods. The results validate the AAG system's potential to transform educational assessment by prioritizing learning experiences and providing scalable, high-quality feedback.</p></details> |  |
| **[MASTER: A Multi-Agent System with LLM Specialized MCTS](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14304v1)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLM) are increasingly being explored for problem-solving tasks. However, their strategic planning capability is often viewed with skepticism. Recent studies have incorporated the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to augment the planning capacity of LLM. Despite its potential, MCTS relies on extensive sampling simulations to approximate the true reward distribution, leading to two primary issues. Firstly, MCTS is effective for tasks like the Game of Go, where simulation results can yield objective rewards (e.g., 1 for a win and 0 for a loss). However, for tasks such as question answering, the result of a simulation is the answer to the question, which cannot obtain an objective reward without the ground truth. Secondly, obtaining statistically significant reward estimations typically requires a sample size exceeding 30 simulations, resulting in excessive token usage and time consumption. To address these challenges, we present Multi-Agent System with Tactical Execution and Reasoning using LLM Specialized MCTS (MASTER), a novel framework that coordinates agent recruitment and communication using LLM specialized MCTS. This system autonomously adjusts the number of agents based on task complexity and ensures focused communication among them. Comprehensive experiments across various tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework. It achieves 76% accuracy on HotpotQA and 80% on WebShop, setting new state-of-the-art performance on these datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by main NAACL 2025</p></details> |
| **[What Did I Do Wrong? Quantifying LLMs' Sensitivity and Consistency to Prompt Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12334v3)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) changed the way we design and interact with software systems. Their ability to process and extract information from text has drastically improved productivity in a number of routine tasks. Developers that want to include these models in their software stack, however, face a dreadful challenge: debugging LLMs' inconsistent behavior across minor variations of the prompt. We therefore introduce two metrics for classification tasks, namely sensitivity and consistency, which are complementary to task performance. First, sensitivity measures changes of predictions across rephrasings of the prompt, and does not require access to ground truth labels. Instead, consistency measures how predictions vary across rephrasings for elements of the same class. We perform an empirical comparison of these metrics on text classification tasks, using them as guideline for understanding failure modes of the LLM. Our hope is that sensitivity and consistency will be helpful to guide prompt engineering and obtain LLMs that balance robustness with performance.</p></details> |  |

Traditional statistical TPPs have a long-standing history, with numerous models proposed and successfully applied across diverse domains. In recent years, advances in deep learning have spurred the development of neural TPPs, enabling greater flexibility and expressiveness in capturing complex temporal dynamics. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has further sparked excitement, offering new possibilities for modeling and analyzing event sequences by leveraging their rich contextual understanding. This survey presents a comprehensive review of recent research on TPPs from three perspectives: Bayesian, deep learning, and LLM approaches. We begin with a review of the fundamental concepts of TPPs, followed by an in-depth discussion of model design and parameter estimation techniques in these three frameworks. We also revisit classic application areas of TPPs to highlight their practical relevance. Finally, we outline challenges and promising directions for future research.</p></details> |  |

However, the training and evaluation of these models are constrained by the limited size and quality of available datasets, as creating large-scale data for such advanced problems requires extensive effort from human experts. In addition, current benchmarks are prone to contamination, leading to unreliable evaluations. In this paper, we present an automated pipeline that leverages the rich resources of the Art of Problem Solving (AoPS) forum, which predominantly features Olympiad-level problems and community-driven solutions. Using open-source LLMs, we develop a method to extract question-answer pairs from the forum, resulting in AoPS-Instruct, a dataset of more than 600,000 high-quality QA pairs. Our experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning LLMs on AoPS-Instruct improves their reasoning abilities across various benchmarks. Moreover, we build an automatic pipeline that introduces LiveAoPSBench, an evolving evaluation set with timestamps, derived from the latest forum data, providing a contamination-resistant benchmark for assessing LLM performance. Notably, we observe a significant decline in LLM performance over time, suggesting their success on older examples may stem from pre-training exposure rather than true reasoning ability. Our work presents a scalable approach to creating and maintaining large-scale, high-quality datasets for advanced math reasoning, offering valuable insights into the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in this domain.

While translating natural language into SQL queries is well-researched, generating Cypher queries for Neo4j remains relatively underexplored. In this work, we present an automated, LLM-Supervised, pipeline to generate high-quality synthetic data for Text2Cypher. Our Cypher data generation pipeline introduces LLM-As-Database-Filler, a novel strategy for ensuring Cypher query correctness, thus resulting in high quality generations. Using our pipeline, we generate high quality Text2Cypher data - SynthCypher containing 29.8k instances across various domains and queries with varying complexities. Training open-source LLMs like LLaMa-3.1-8B, Mistral-7B, and QWEN-7B on SynthCypher results in performance gains of up to 40% on the Text2Cypher test split and 30% on the SPIDER benchmark, adapted for graph databases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NAACL 2025 main conference</p></details> |

Recent research has proposed replacing SiLU with ReLU to induce significant activation sparsity and showed no downstream task accuracy degradation through fine tuning. However, taking full advantage of it required training a predictor to estimate this sparsity. In this paper, we introduce SparseInfer, a simple, light weight, and training free predictor for activation sparsity of ReLU field LLMs, in which activation sparsity is predicted by comparing only the sign bits of inputs and weights. To compensate for possible prediction inaccuracy, an adaptive tuning of the predictor's conservativeness is enabled, which can also serve as a control knob for optimizing LLM inference. The proposed method achieves approximately faster inference speed over the state of the art, with negligible accuracy loss of within 1%p.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |

However, resource-limited mobile edge networks struggle to support long-context LLM serving for LLM agents during multi-round interactions with users. Unlike stateless computation offloading and static service offloading in edge computing, optimizing LLM serving at edge servers is challenging because LLMs continuously learn from context which raises accuracy, latency, and resource consumption dynamics. In this paper, we propose a joint model caching and inference offloading framework that utilizes test-time deep reinforcement learning (T2DRL) to optimize deployment and execution strategies for long-context LLM serving. In this framework, we analyze the performance convergence and design an optimization problem considering the utilization of context windows in LLMs. Furthermore, the T2DRL algorithm can learn in both the training phase and the testing phase to proactively manage cached models and service requests and adapt to context changes and usage patterns during execution. To further enhance resource allocation efficiency, we propose a double Dutch auction (DDA) mechanism, which dynamically matches supply and demand while maximizing social welfare. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that the T2DRL algorithm can reduce system costs by at least 30% compared to baselines while guaranteeing the performance of LLM agents in real-world perception and reasoning tasks.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Transformer-Squared, a novel self-adaptation framework that adapts LLMs for unseen tasks in real-time by selectively adjusting only the singular components of their weight matrices. During inference, Transformer-Squared employs a two-pass mechanism: first, a dispatch system identifies the task properties, and then task-specific 'expert' vectors, trained using reinforcement learning, are dynamically mixed to obtain targeted behavior for the incoming prompt. Our method consistently outperforms ubiquitous approaches such as LoRA, with fewer parameters and greater efficiency. Furthermore, Transformer-Squared demonstrates versatility across different LLM architectures and modalities, including vision-language tasks. Transformer-Squared represents a significant leap forward, offering a scalable, efficient solution for enhancing the adaptability and task-specific performance of LLMs, paving the way for truly dynamic, self-organizing AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at the 13th International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2025)</p></details> |

Existing benchmarks often depend on static datasets, which are vulnerable to data contamination and may get saturated over time, or on binary live human feedback that conflates reasoning with other abilities. As the most prominent dynamic benchmark, Chatbot Arena evaluates open-ended questions in real-world settings, but lacks the granularity in assessing specific reasoning capabilities. We introduce GameArena, a dynamic benchmark designed to evaluate LLM reasoning capabilities through interactive gameplay with humans. GameArena consists of three games designed to test specific reasoning capabilities (e.g., deductive and inductive reasoning), while keeping participants entertained and engaged. We analyze the gaming data retrospectively to uncover the underlying reasoning processes of LLMs and measure their fine-grained reasoning capabilities. We collect over 2000 game sessions and provide detailed assessments of various reasoning capabilities for five state-of-the-art LLMs. Our user study with 100 participants suggests that GameArena improves user engagement compared to Chatbot Arena. For the first time, GameArena enables the collection of step-by-step LLM reasoning data in the wild.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose two novel methods to effectively utilize LLMs for low-resource text summarization: 1) MixSumm, an LLM-based data augmentation regime that synthesizes high-quality documents (short and long) for few-shot text summarization, and 2) PPSL, a prompt-based pseudolabeling strategy for sample-efficient semi-supervised text summarization. Specifically, MixSumm leverages the open-source LLaMA-3-70b-Instruct model to generate new documents by mixing topical information derived from a small seed set, and PPSL leverages the LLaMA-3-70b-Instruct model to generate high-quality pseudo-labels in a semi-supervised learning setup. We evaluate our methods on the TweetSumm, WikiHow, and ArXiv/PubMed datasets and use L-Eval, a LLaMA-3-based evaluation metric, and ROUGE scores to measure the quality of generated summaries. Our experiments on extractive and abstractive summarization show that MixSumm and PPSL achieve competitive ROUGE scores as a fully supervised method with 5% of the labeled data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NAACL 2025 (Findings)</p></details> |

However, leveraging larger datasets requires balancing quality, quantity, and diversity across sources. After evaluating nine baseline methods under both compute- and data-constrained scenarios, we find token-count heuristics outperform manual and learned mixes, indicating that simple approaches accounting for dataset size and diversity are surprisingly effective. Building on this insight, we propose two complementary approaches: UtiliMax, which extends token-based heuristics by incorporating utility estimates from reduced-scale ablations, achieving up to a 10.6x speedup over manual baselines; and Model Estimated Data Utility (MEDU), which leverages LLMs to estimate data utility from small samples, matching ablation-based performance while reducing computational requirements by $\sim$200x. Together, these approaches establish a new framework for automated, compute-efficient data mixing that is robust across training regimes.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures |

Various jailbreaking techniques have been developed to expose the vulnerabilities of these models and improve their safety. This work reveals that many state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source LLMs are vulnerable to malicious requests hidden behind scientific language. Specifically, our experiments with GPT4o, GPT4o-mini, GPT-4, LLama3-405B-Instruct, Llama3-70B-Instruct, Cohere, Gemini models on the StereoSet data demonstrate that, the models' biases and toxicity substantially increase when prompted with requests that deliberately misinterpret social science and psychological studies as evidence supporting the benefits of stereotypical biases. Alarmingly, these models can also be manipulated to generate fabricated scientific arguments claiming that biases are beneficial, which can be used by ill-intended actors to systematically jailbreak even the strongest models like GPT. Our analysis studies various factors that contribute to the models' vulnerabilities to malicious requests in academic language. Mentioning author names and venues enhances the persuasiveness of some models, and the bias scores can increase as dialogues progress. Our findings call for a more careful investigation on the use of scientific data in the training of LLMs.</p></details> | 15 pages |

However, many users remain unaware of the risks. This paper explores methods to increase user awareness of privacy risks associated with LLMs in end-user applications. We conducted five co-design workshops to uncover user privacy concerns and their demand for contextual privacy information within LLMs. Based on these insights, we developed CLEAR (Contextual LLM-Empowered Privacy Policy Analysis and Risk Generation), a just-in-time contextual assistant designed to help users identify sensitive information, summarize relevant privacy policies, and highlight potential risks when sharing information with LLMs. We evaluated the usability and usefulness of CLEAR across two example domains: ChatGPT and the Gemini plugin in Gmail. Our findings demonstrated that CLEAR is easy to use and improves users' understanding of data practices and privacy risks. We also discussed LLM's duality in posing and mitigating privacy risks, offering design and policy implications.</p></details> |  |

This evaluation is used to identify and prioritize Indic languages suited for inclusion in safety benchmarks. We conduct this study by reviewing existing evaluation studies and datasets; and a set of twenty-eight LLMs that support Indic languages. We analyze the LLMs on the basis of the training data, license for model and data, type of access and model developers. We also compare Indic language performance across evaluation datasets and find that significant performance disparities in performance across Indic languages. Hindi is the most widely represented language in models. While model performance roughly correlates with number of speakers for the top five languages, the assessment after that varies.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 2 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

At the core of these agents, an LLM must plan, execute, and respond using external tools, APIs, and custom functions. Research on tool calling has gathered momentum, but evaluation benchmarks and datasets representing the complexity of the tasks have lagged behind. In this work, we focus on one such complexity, nested sequencing, with the goal of extending existing benchmarks and evaluation. Specifically, we present NESTFUL, a benchmark to evaluate LLMs on nested sequences of API calls, i.e., sequences where the output of one API call is passed as input to a subsequent call. NESTFUL contains 1800+ nested sequences where all the function calls are executable. Experimental results on multiple models and settings show that the best-performing model on the dataset has a full sequence match accuracy of 25% and win-rate of 34% necessitating a large scope for improvement in the nested sequencing aspect of function calling. Our analysis of these results provides possible future research directions for the community, in addition to a benchmark to track progress. We have released the NESTFUL dataset under the Apache 2.0 license at https://github.com/IBM/NESTFUL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Finetuned Audio-LLM on Heart Murmur Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13884v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) for audio have excelled in recognizing and analyzing human speech, music, and environmental sounds. However, their potential for understanding other types of sounds, particularly biomedical sounds, remains largely underexplored despite significant scientific interest. In this study, we focus on diagnosing cardiovascular diseases using phonocardiograms, i.e., heart sounds. Most existing deep neural network (DNN) paradigms are restricted to heart murmur classification (healthy vs unhealthy) and do not predict other acoustic features of the murmur such as timing, grading, harshness, pitch, and quality, which are important in helping physicians diagnose the underlying heart conditions. We propose to finetune an audio LLM, Qwen2-Audio, on the PhysioNet CirCor DigiScope phonocardiogram (PCG) dataset and evaluate its performance in classifying 11 expert-labeled murmur features. Additionally, we aim to achieve more noise-robust and generalizable system by exploring a preprocessing segmentation algorithm using an audio representation model, SSAMBA. Our results indicate that the LLM-based model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in 8 of the 11 features and performs comparably in the remaining 3. Moreover, the LLM successfully classifies long-tail murmur features with limited training data, a task that all previous methods have failed to classify. These findings underscore the potential of audio LLMs as assistants to human cardiologists in enhancing heart disease diagnosis.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 1 figure, and 3 tables.

This has led many to propose that LLMs can be used as surrogates or simulations for humans in social science research. However, LLMs differ fundamentally from humans, relying on probabilistic patterns, absent the embodied experiences or survival objectives that shape human cognition. We assess the reasoning depth of LLMs using the 11-20 money request game. Nearly all advanced approaches fail to replicate human behavior distributions across many models. Causes of failure are diverse and unpredictable, relating to input language, roles, and safeguarding. These results advise caution when using LLMs to study human behavior or as surrogates or simulations.</p></details> |  |

In this study we evaluate the potential for LLMs to be part of the solution for mitigating online dis/misinformation rather than the problem. Employing a public expert annotated dataset and a curated sample of social media content we evaluate the performance of proprietary vs. open source LLMs on climate misinformation classification task, comparing them to existing climate-focused computer-assisted tools and expert assessments. Results show (1) state-of-the-art (SOTA) open-source models substantially under-perform in classifying climate misinformation compared to proprietary models, (2) existing climate-focused computer-assisted tools leveraging expert-annotated datasets continues to outperform many of proprietary models, including GPT-4o, and (3) demonstrate the efficacy and generalizability of fine-tuning GPT-3.5-turbo on expert annotated dataset in classifying claims about climate change at the equivalency of climate change experts with over 20 years of experience in climate communication. These findings highlight 1) the importance of incorporating human-oversight, such as incorporating expert-annotated datasets in training LLMs, for governance tasks that require subject-matter expertise like classifying climate misinformation, and 2) the potential for LLMs in facilitating civil society organizations to engage in various governance tasks such as classifying false or misleading claims in domains beyond climate change such as politics and health science.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the AI Governance Workshop at AAAI 2025</p></details> |

Existing XR user analytics frameworks face challenges in handling cross-virtuality - AR, VR, MR - transitions, multi-user collaborative application scenarios, and the complexity of multimodal data. Explainable XR addresses these challenges by providing a virtuality-agnostic solution for the collection, analysis, and visualization of immersive sessions. We propose three main components in our framework: (1) A novel user data recording schema, called User Action Descriptor (UAD), that can capture the users' multimodal actions, along with their intents and the contexts; (2) a platform-agnostic XR session recorder, and (3) a visual analytics interface that offers LLM-assisted insights tailored to the analysts' perspectives, facilitating the exploration and analysis of the recorded XR session data. We demonstrate the versatility of Explainable XR by demonstrating five use-case scenarios, in both individual and collaborative XR applications across virtualities. Our technical evaluation and user studies show that Explainable XR provides a highly usable analytics solution for understanding user actions and delivering multifaceted, actionable insights into user behaviors in immersive environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 8 figures.

| **[Can LLMs Solve longer Math Word Problems Better?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14804v2)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Math Word Problems (MWPs) play a vital role in assessing the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet current research primarily focuses on questions with concise contexts. The impact of longer contexts on mathematical reasoning remains under-explored. This study pioneers the investigation of Context Length Generalizability (CoLeG), which refers to the ability of LLMs to solve MWPs with extended narratives. We introduce Extended Grade-School Math (E-GSM), a collection of MWPs featuring lengthy narratives, and propose two novel metrics to evaluate the efficacy and resilience of LLMs in tackling these problems. Our analysis of existing zero-shot prompting techniques with proprietary LLMs along with open-source LLMs reveals a general deficiency in CoLeG. To alleviate these issues, we propose tailored approaches for different categories of LLMs. For proprietary LLMs, we introduce a new instructional prompt designed to mitigate the impact of long contexts. For open-source LLMs, we develop a novel auxiliary task for fine-tuning to enhance CoLeG. Our comprehensive results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods, showing improved performance on E-GSM. Additionally, we conduct an in-depth analysis to differentiate the effects of semantic understanding and reasoning efficacy, showing that our methods improves the latter. We also establish the generalizability of our methods across several other MWP benchmarks. Our findings highlight the limitations of current LLMs and offer practical solutions correspondingly, paving the way for further exploration of model generalizability and training methodologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025</p></details> |

In this work, we evaluate the ability of Llama-3 at attributing utterances of direct-speech to their speaker in novels. The LLM shows impressive results on a corpus of 28 novels, surpassing published results with ChatGPT and encoder-based baselines by a large margin. We then validate these results by assessing the impact of book memorization and annotation contamination. We found that these types of memorization do not explain the large performance gain, making Llama-3 the new state-of-the-art for quotation attribution in English literature. We release publicly our code and data.</p></details> | <details><summary>NAACL...</summary><p>NAACL 2025 Main Conference -- short paper</p></details> |

Traditional methods necessitate text-based queries and manual subgraph explorations, often resulting in time-consuming processes. EICopilot, deployed as a chatbot via Baidu Enterprise Search, improves this landscape by utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) to interpret natural language queries. This solution automatically generates and executes Gremlin scripts, providing efficient summaries of complex enterprise relationships. Distinct feature a data pre-processing pipeline that compiles and annotates representative queries into a vector database of examples for In-context learning (ICL), a comprehensive reasoning pipeline combining Chain-of-Thought with ICL to enhance Gremlin script generation for knowledge graph search and exploration, and a novel query masking strategy that improves intent recognition for heightened script accuracy. Empirical evaluations demonstrate the superior performance of EICopilot, including speed and accuracy, over baseline methods, with the \emph{Full Mask} variant achieving a syntax error rate reduction to as low as 10.00% and an execution correctness of up to 82.14%. These components collectively contribute to superior querying capabilities and summarization of intricate datasets, positioning EICopilot as a groundbreaking tool in the exploration and exploitation of large-scale knowledge graphs for enterprise information search.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pseudocode-Injection Magic: Enabling LLMs to Tackle Graph Computational Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13731v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph computational tasks are inherently challenging and often demand the development of advanced algorithms for effective solutions. With the emergence of large language models (LLMs), researchers have begun investigating their potential to address these tasks. However, existing approaches are constrained by LLMs' limited capability to comprehend complex graph structures and their high inference costs, rendering them impractical for handling large-scale graphs. Inspired by human approaches to graph problems, we introduce a novel framework, PIE (Pseudocode-Injection-Enhanced LLM Reasoning for Graph Computational Tasks), which consists of three key steps: problem understanding, prompt design, and code generation. In this framework, LLMs are tasked with understanding the problem and extracting relevant information to generate correct code. The responsibility for analyzing the graph structure and executing the code is delegated to the interpreter. We inject task-related pseudocodes into the prompts to further assist the LLMs in generating efficient code. We also employ cost-effective trial-and-error techniques to ensure that the LLM-generated code executes correctly. Unlike other methods that require invoking LLMs for each individual test case, PIE only calls the LLM during the code generation phase, allowing the generated code to be reused and significantly reducing inference costs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PIE outperforms existing baselines in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency.</p></details> | 24 pages |

Despite the wealth of information in these records, their complexity and volume make it difficult for users to retrieve and interpret crucial health insights. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a solution, enabling semantic question answering (QA) over medical data, allowing users to interact with their health records more effectively. However, ensuring privacy and compliance requires edge and private deployments of LLMs. This paper proposes a novel approach to semantic QA over EHRs by first identifying the most relevant FHIR resources for a user query (Task1) and subsequently answering the query based on these resources (Task2). We explore the performance of privately hosted, fine-tuned LLMs, evaluating them against benchmark models such as GPT-4 and GPT-4o. Our results demonstrate that fine-tuned LLMs, while 250x smaller in size, outperform GPT-4 family models by 0.55% in F1 score on Task1 and 42% on Meteor Task in Task2. Additionally, we examine advanced aspects of LLM usage, including sequential fine-tuning, model self-evaluation (narcissistic evaluation), and the impact of training data size on performance.

We introduce HumorReject, a novel data-driven approach that fundamentally reimagines LLM safety by decoupling it from refusal prefixes through the use of humor as an indirect refusal strategy. Rather than explicitly rejecting harmful instructions, HumorReject responds with contextually appropriate humor that naturally defuses potentially dangerous requests while maintaining engaging interactions. Our approach effectively addresses the common "over-defense" issues in existing safety mechanisms, demonstrating superior robustness against various attack vectors while preserving natural and high-quality interactions on legitimate tasks. Our findings suggest that innovations at the data level are even more fundamental than the alignment algorithm itself in achieving effective LLM safety, opening new directions for developing more resilient and user-friendly AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[How to Complete Domain Tuning while Keeping General Ability in LLM: Adaptive Layer-wise and Element-wise Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13669v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong general-purpose language capabilities. However, fine-tuning these models on domain-specific tasks often leads to catastrophic forgetting, where the model overwrites or loses essential knowledge acquired during pretraining. This phenomenon significantly limits the broader applicability of LLMs. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach to compute the element-wise importance of model parameters crucial for preserving general knowledge during fine-tuning. Our method utilizes a dual-objective optimization strategy: (1) regularization loss to retain the parameter crucial for general knowledge; (2) cross-entropy loss to adapt to domain-specific tasks. Additionally, we introduce layer-wise coefficients to account for the varying contributions of different layers, dynamically balancing the dual-objective optimization. Extensive experiments on scientific, medical, and physical tasks using GPT-J and LLaMA-3 demonstrate that our approach mitigates catastrophic forgetting while enhancing model adaptability. Compared to previous methods, our solution is approximately 20 times faster and requires only 10%-15% of the storage, highlighting the practical efficiency. The code will be released.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[LLMs Can Plan Only If We Tell Them](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13545v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities in natural language processing and reasoning, yet their effectiveness in autonomous planning has been under debate. While existing studies have utilized LLMs with external feedback mechanisms or in controlled environments for planning, these approaches often involve substantial computational and development resources due to the requirement for careful design and iterative backprompting. Moreover, even the most advanced LLMs like GPT-4 struggle to match human performance on standard planning benchmarks, such as the Blocksworld, without additional support. This paper investigates whether LLMs can independently generate long-horizon plans that rival human baselines. Our novel enhancements to Algorithm-of-Thoughts (AoT), which we dub AoT+, help achieve state-of-the-art results in planning benchmarks out-competing prior methods and human baselines all autonomously.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

While previous research has explored the abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to serve as co-creative partners in tasks like writing poetry or creating narratives, the collaborative potential of LLMs in humor-rich and culturally nuanced domains remains an open question. To address this gap, we conducted a user study to explore the potential of LLMs in co-creating memes - a humor-driven and culturally specific form of creative expression. We conducted a user study with three groups of 50 participants each: a human-only group creating memes without AI assistance, a human-AI collaboration group interacting with a state-of-the-art LLM model, and an AI-only group where the LLM autonomously generated memes. We assessed the quality of the generated memes through crowdsourcing, with each meme rated on creativity, humor, and shareability. Our results showed that LLM assistance increased the number of ideas generated and reduced the effort participants felt. However, it did not improve the quality of the memes when humans collaborated with LLM. Interestingly, memes created entirely by AI performed better than both human-only and human-AI collaborative memes in all areas on average. However, when looking at the top-performing memes, human-created ones were better in humor, while human-AI collaborations stood out in creativity and shareability. These findings highlight the complexities of human-AI collaboration in creative tasks. While AI can boost productivity and create content that appeals to a broad audience, human creativity remains crucial for content that connects on a deeper level.</p></details> | <details><summary>to ap...</summary><p>to appear in: 30th International Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces IUI 25 March 2427 2025 Cagliari Italy</p></details> |

However, their reliance on high-quality copyrighted datasets raises concerns about copyright infringements in generated texts. Current research often employs prompt engineering or semantic classifiers to identify copyrighted content, but these approaches have two significant limitations: (1) Challenging to identify which specific sub-dataset (e.g., works from particular authors) influences an LLM's output. (2) Treating the entire training database as copyrighted, hence overlooking the inclusion of non-copyrighted training data. We propose InnerProbe, a lightweight framework designed to evaluate the influence of copyrighted sub-datasets on LLM-generated texts. Unlike traditional methods relying solely on text, we discover that the results of multi-head attention (MHA) during LLM output generation provide more effective information. Thus, InnerProbe performs sub-dataset contribution analysis using a lightweight LSTM-based network trained on MHA results in a supervised manner. Harnessing such a prior, InnerProbe enables non-copyrighted text detection through a concatenated global projector trained with unsupervised contrastive learning. InnerProbe demonstrates 3x improved efficiency compared to semantic model training in sub-dataset contribution analysis on Books3, achieves 15.04%-58.7% higher accuracy over baselines on the Pile, and delivers a 0.104 increase in AUC for non-copyrighted data filtering.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Testing for LLM-Based Applications: A Diversity-based Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13480v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent surge of building software systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to the development of various testing frameworks, primarily focused on treating prompt templates as the unit of testing. Despite the significant costs associated with test input execution and output assessment, the curation of optimized test suites is yet overlooked in these tools, which calls for tailored test selection or prioritization strategies. In this paper, we show that diversity-based testing techniques, such as Adaptive Random Testing (ART) with appropriate string distance metrics, can be effectively applied to the testing of prompt templates. Our proposed adaptive testing approach adjusts the conventional ART process to this context by selecting new test inputs based on scores derived from existing test suite and their labelling results. Our results, obtained using various implementations that explore several string-based distances, confirm that our approach enables the discovery of failures with reduced testing budgets and promotes the generation of more varied outputs.</p></details> | 9 pages |

However, many models and techniques tend to produce excessively verbose and lengthy answers, leading to issues with both conciseness and generation time. To address this, this paper analyzes the impact of output lengths on LLM inference pipelines by introducing and proposing novel metrics to evaluate the \textit{correct conciseness} of a model and related prompting techniques. Then, we examine the impact of controlling output length through a refined prompt engineering strategy, Constrained-CoT (CCoT), which encourages the model to produce more concise outputs. To better understand the effects of such a prompt, we also introduce two additional scores for analyzing the conciseness, measured in terms of redundancy and information flow in generated answers. Experiments on pretrained LLMs and multiple datasets demonstrate the benefits of the proposed metrics and the effectiveness of CCoT across different models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint version, under review</p></details> |

But do RAG implementations leave out important information when answering queries that need an integrated analysis of information (e.g., Tell me good news in the stock market today.)? To address these concerns, RAG developers need to annotate information retrieval (IR) data for their domain of interest, which is challenging because (1) domain-specific queries usually need nuanced definitions of relevance beyond shallow semantic relevance; and (2) human or GPT-4 annotation is costly and cannot cover all (query, document) pairs (i.e., annotation selection bias), thus harming the effectiveness in evaluating IR recall. To address these challenges, we propose DIRAS (Domain-specific Information Retrieval Annotation with Scalability), a manual-annotation-free schema that fine-tunes open-sourced LLMs to consider nuanced relevance definition and annotate (partial) relevance labels with calibrated relevance scores. Extensive evaluation shows that DIRAS enables smaller (8B) LLMs to achieve GPT-4-level performance on annotating and ranking unseen (query, document) pairs, and is helpful for real-world RAG development. All code, LLM generations, and human annotations can be found in \url{https://github.com/EdisonNi-hku/DIRAS}.</p></details> | NAACL 2025 Long |

However, despite their potential, existing works face challenges when applying LLMs to medical settings. Strategies relying on training with medical datasets are highly cost-intensive and may suffer from outdated training data. Leveraging external knowledge bases is a suitable alternative, yet it faces obstacles such as limited retrieval precision and poor effectiveness in answer extraction. These issues collectively prevent LLMs from demonstrating the expected level of proficiency in mastering medical expertise. To address these challenges, we introduce Med-R^2, a novel LLM physician framework that adheres to the Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) process, efficiently integrating retrieval mechanisms as well as the selection and reasoning processes of evidence, thereby enhancing the problem-solving capabilities of LLMs in healthcare scenarios and fostering a trustworthy LLM physician. Our comprehensive experiments indicate that Med-R^2 achieves a 14.87\% improvement over vanilla RAG methods and even a 3.59\% enhancement compared to fine-tuning strategies, without incurring additional training costs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Comprehensive Modeling and Question Answering of Cancer Clinical Practice Guidelines using LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13984v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The updated recommendations on diagnostic procedures and treatment pathways for a medical condition are documented as graphical flows in Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs). For effective use of the CPGs in helping medical professionals in the treatment decision process, it is necessary to fully capture the guideline knowledge, particularly the contexts and their relationships in the graph. While several existing works have utilized these guidelines to create rule bases for Clinical Decision Support Systems, limited work has been done toward directly capturing the full medical knowledge contained in CPGs. This work proposes an approach to create a contextually enriched, faithful digital representation of National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Cancer CPGs in the form of graphs using automated extraction and node & relationship classification. We also implement semantic enrichment of the model by using Large Language Models (LLMs) for node classification, achieving an accuracy of 80.86% and 88.47% with zero-shot learning and few-shot learning, respectively. Additionally, we introduce a methodology for answering natural language questions with constraints to guideline text by leveraging LLMs to extract the relevant subgraph from the guideline knowledge base. By generating natural language answers based on subgraph paths and semantic information, we mitigate the risk of incorrect answers and hallucination associated with LLMs, ensuring factual accuracy in medical domain Question Answering.</p></details> |  |
| **[Catastrophic Failure of LLM Unlearning via Quantization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16454v2)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable proficiency in generating text, benefiting from extensive training on vast textual corpora. However, LLMs may also acquire unwanted behaviors from the diverse and sensitive nature of their training data, which can include copyrighted and private content. Machine unlearning has been introduced as a viable solution to remove the influence of such problematic content without the need for costly and time-consuming retraining. This process aims to erase specific knowledge from LLMs while preserving as much model utility as possible. Despite the effectiveness of current unlearning methods, little attention has been given to whether existing unlearning methods for LLMs truly achieve forgetting or merely hide the knowledge, which current unlearning benchmarks fail to detect. This paper reveals that applying quantization to models that have undergone unlearning can restore the "forgotten" information. To thoroughly evaluate this phenomenon, we conduct comprehensive experiments using various quantization techniques across multiple precision levels. We find that for unlearning methods with utility constraints, the unlearned model retains an average of 21\% of the intended forgotten knowledge in full precision, which significantly increases to 83\% after 4-bit quantization. ...

| **[Each Graph is a New Language: Graph Learning with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11478v2)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent efforts leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for modeling text-attributed graph structures in node classification tasks. These approaches describe graph structures for LLMs to understand or aggregate LLM-generated textual attribute embeddings through graph structure. However, these approaches face two main limitations in modeling graph structures with LLMs. (i) Graph descriptions become verbose in describing high-order graph structure. (ii) Textual attributes alone do not contain adequate graph structure information. It is challenging to model graph structure concisely and adequately with LLMs. LLMs lack built-in mechanisms to model graph structures directly. They also struggle with complex long-range dependencies between high-order nodes and target nodes. Inspired by the observation that LLMs pre-trained on one language can achieve exceptional performance on another with minimal additional training, we propose \textbf{G}raph-\textbf{D}efined \textbf{L}anguage for \textbf{L}arge \textbf{L}anguage \textbf{M}odel (GDL4LLM). This novel framework enables LLMs to transfer their powerful language understanding capabilities to graph-structured data. GDL4LLM translates graphs into a graph language corpus instead of graph descriptions and pre-trains LLMs on this corpus to adequately understand graph structures. During fine-tuning, this corpus describes the structural information of target nodes concisely with only a few tokens. By treating graphs as a new language, GDL4LLM enables LLMs to model graph structures adequately and concisely for node classification tasks. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that GDL4LLM outperforms description-based and textual attribute embeddings-based baselines by efficiently modeling different orders of graph structure with LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving LLM Abilities in Idiomatic Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03518v4)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For large language models (LLMs) like NLLB and GPT, translating idioms remains a challenge. Our goal is to enhance translation fidelity by improving LLM processing of idiomatic language while preserving the original linguistic style. This has a significant social impact, as it preserves cultural nuances and ensures translated texts retain their intent and emotional resonance, fostering better cross-cultural communication. Previous work has utilized knowledge bases like IdiomKB by providing the LLM with the meaning of an idiom to use in translation. Although this method yielded better results than a direct translation, it is still limited in its ability to preserve idiomatic writing style across languages. In this research, we expand upon the knowledge base to find corresponding idioms in the target language. Our research performs translations using two methods: The first method employs the SentenceTransformers model to semantically generate cosine similarity scores between the meanings of the original and target language idioms, selecting the best idiom (Cosine Similarity method). The second method uses an LLM to find a corresponding idiom in the target language for use in the translation (LLM-generated idiom method). As a baseline, we performed a direct translation without providing additional information. Human evaluations on the English -> Chinese, and Chinese -> English show the Cosine Similarity Lookup method out-performed others in all GPT4o translations. To further build upon IdiomKB, we developed a low-resource Urdu dataset containing Urdu idioms and their translations. Despite dataset limitations, the Cosine Similarity Lookup method shows promise, potentially overcoming language barriers and enabling the exploration of diverse literary works in Chinese and Urdu.(LoResLM @ COLING Preprint)</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint for LoResLM Workshop at COLING 2025</p></details> |

Although low-bit quantization techniques, such as 4-bit quantization, present a potential solution, they frequently lead to significant accuracy degradation or require substantial effort for such aggressive quantization approaches. To overcome these challenges, we introduce QRazor, a reliable and effortless quantization scheme designed to enable 4-bit quantization for weights, activations, and KV cache in transformer-based LLMs. The scheme involves two main stages: quantization and compression. During the quantization stage, weights, activations, and KV cache values are quantized with wider 8 or 16-bit integers as a basis to achieve nearly identical accuracy to the original full-precision LLM models, using the absolute max scaling. Subsequently, all data are compressed to 4-bit using our proposed significant data razoring (SDR) technique, which retains only the four most salient bits while discarding the others. Furthermore, we present an integer-based arithmetic unit dedicated to QRazor, enabling direct low-precision arithmetic operations without decompressing the SDR data. Despite the reduced quantization effort, QRazor achieves LLM accuracies better or comparable to state-of-the-art 4-bit methods. By also validating the hardware efficiency, our decompression-free arithmetic unit achieves 61.2% and 57.8% reduction in area and power consumption, respectively.</p></details> | 19 pages |

Methods like prompt-based In-Context Knowledge Editing (IKE) and gradient-based Model Editor Networks (MEND) have been explored but show irregularity and variability; IKE depends on the prompt, leading to variability and sensitivity, while MEND yields inconsistent and gibberish outputs. To address this, we employed Opinion QA Based Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), specifically Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA), to manipulate the Big Five personality traits: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. After PEFT, models such as Mistral-7B-Instruct and LLaMA-2-7B-chat began generating emojis, even though no emojis were present in the PEFT data. For instance, LLaMA-2-7B-chat generated emojis in 99.5% of extraversion-related test instances, while Mistral-7B-Instruct did so in 92.5% of openness-related test instances. ICL Explainability analysis indicated that the LLMs used emojis intentionally to express these traits. Mechanistic Interpretability analysis showed that this latent behaviour of LLMs could be traced to specific neurons that became activated or amplified after PEFT. This paper provides a number of novel contributions. First, introducing an Opinion QA dataset for PEFT-driven personality manipulation; second, developing metric models to benchmark LLM personality traits; third, demonstrating PEFT's superiority over IKE in personality manipulation; and finally, analysing and validating emoji usage through explainability methods such as Mechanistic Interpretability and In-context learning Explainability methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Findi...</summary><p>Findings paper of NAACL 2025 and NeurIPS 2024 Workshop on Behavioral Machine Learning</p></details> |

Training the whole model for downstream tasks is expensive, and could easily result in catastrophic forgetting. By introducing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), the training cost could be reduced, but it still suffers from forgetting, and limits the learning on the downstream tasks. To efficiently fine-tune the LLMs with less limitation to their downstream performance while mitigating the forgetting of general capabilities, we propose a novel mixture of expert (MoE) framework based on Soft LoRA and Identity Mixture (SLIM), that allows dynamic routing between LoRA adapters and skipping connection, enables the suppression of forgetting. We adopt weight-yielding with sliding clustering for better out-of-domain distinguish to enhance the routing. We also propose to convert the mixture of low-rank adapters to the model merging formulation and introduce fast dynamic merging of LoRA adapters to keep the general capabilities of the base model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed SLIM is comparable to the state-of-the-art PEFT approaches on the downstream tasks while achieving the leading performance in mitigating catastrophic forgetting.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 7 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Accurate sidewalk detection is crucial in improving road safety and urban planning. The study evaluated the model's performance on Cityscapes, Ade20k, and the Boston Dataset. The results showed that the ensemble model performed better than the individual models, achieving mean Intersection Over Union (mIOU) scores of 93.1\%, 90.3\%, and 90.6\% on these datasets under ideal conditions. Additionally, the ensemble model maintained a consistent level of performance even in challenging conditions such as Salt-and-Pepper and Speckle noise, with only a gradual decrease in efficiency observed. On the other hand, the ONE-PEACE LLM performed slightly better than the ensemble model in ideal scenarios but experienced a significant decline in performance under noisy conditions. These findings demonstrate the robustness and reliability of the ensemble model, making it a valuable asset for improving urban infrastructure related to road safety and curb space management. This study contributes positively to the broader context of urban health and mobility.</p></details> |  |

Recent research has leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) to accelerate this process. We explore the potential of LLMs to generate viable hypotheses that, once validated, can expedite materials discovery. Collaborating with materials science experts, we curated a novel dataset from recent journal publications, featuring real-world goals, constraints, and methods for designing real-world applications. Using this dataset, we test LLM-based agents that generate hypotheses for achieving given goals under specific constraints. To assess the relevance and quality of these hypotheses, we propose a novel scalable evaluation metric that emulates the process a materials scientist would use to evaluate a hypothesis critically. Our curated dataset, proposed method, and evaluation framework aim to advance future research in accelerating materials discovery and design with LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in NAACL 2025</p></details> |

Applications such as design proposals, technical documentation, and creative writing rely on coherent, instruction-following outputs over extended sequences - a challenge that existing benchmarks do not adequately address. To fill this gap, we introduce LongGenBench, a novel benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate large language models' (LLMs) ability to generate long text while adhering to complex instructions. Through tasks requiring specific events or constraints within generated text, LongGenBench evaluates model performance across four distinct scenarios, three instruction types, and two generation-lengths (16K and 32K tokens). Our evaluation of ten state-of-the-art LLMs reveals that, despite strong results on Ruler, all models struggled with long text generation on LongGenBench, particularly as text length increased. This suggests that current LLMs are not yet equipped to meet the demands of real-world, long-form text generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025; Github: https://github.com/mozhu621/LongGenBench/</p></details> |

It is paramount to ensure the security and reliability of these products by mitigating their vulnerabilities towards malicious user interactions, which can lead to the exposure of great risks and reputational repercussions. In this work, we present a comprehensive study on the efficacy of fine-tuning and aligning Chain-of-Thought (CoT) responses of different LLMs that serve as input moderation guardrails. We systematically explore various tuning methods by leveraging a small set of training data to adapt these models as proxy defense mechanisms to detect malicious inputs and provide a reasoning for their verdicts, thereby preventing the exploitation of conversational agents. We rigorously evaluate the efficacy and robustness of different tuning strategies to generalize across diverse adversarial and malicious query types. Our experimental results outline the potential of alignment processes tailored to a varied range of harmful input queries, even with constrained data resources. These techniques significantly enhance the safety of conversational AI systems and provide a feasible framework for deploying more secure and trustworthy AI-driven interactions.</p></details> | 16 pages, 9 figures |

Beyond the comparison as such, we aim to develop a benchmark to assess the capabilities of LLMs with discourse biases as a robust proxy for more general discourse understanding capabilities. More specifically, we investigated Implicit Causality verbs, for which psycholinguistic research has found participants to display biases with regard to three phenomena:\ the establishment of (i) coreference relations (Experiment 1), (ii) coherence relations (Experiment 2), and (iii) the use of particular referring expressions (Experiments 3 and 4). With regard to coreference biases we found only the largest monolingual LLM (German Bloom 6.4B) to display more human-like biases. For coherence relation, no LLM displayed the explanation bias usually found for humans. For referring expressions, all LLMs displayed a preference for referring to subject arguments with simpler forms than to objects. However, no bias effect on referring expression was found, as opposed to recent studies investigating human biases.</p></details> | 38 pages, 8 figures |

Thus, there are strong incentives to ensure blockchain software is correct -- vulnerabilities here cost millions and break businesses. One of the most powerful ways of establishing software correctness is by using formal methods. Approaches based on formal methods, however, induce a significant overhead in terms of time and expertise required to successfully employ them. Our work addresses this critical disadvantage by automating the creation of a formal model -- a mathematical abstraction of the software system -- which is often a core task when employing formal methods. We perform model synthesis in three phases: we first transpile the code into model stubs; then we "fill in the blanks" using a large language model (LLM); finally, we iteratively repair the generated model, on both syntactical and semantical level. In this way, we significantly reduce the amount of time necessary to create formal models and increase accessibility of valuable software verification methods that rely on them. The practical context of our work was reducing the time-to-value of using formal models for correctness audits of smart contracts.</p></details> |  |

However, it remains unclear how effective students are and what strategies students use while learning with LLMs. Since the majority of students' experiences in online self-learning have come through using search engines such as Google, evaluating AI tools in this context can help us address these gaps. In this mixed methods research, we conducted an exploratory within-subjects study to understand how CS2 students learn programming concepts using both LLMs as well as traditional online methods such as educational websites and videos to examine how students approach learning within and across both scenarios. We discovered that students found it easier to learn a more difficult concept using traditional methods than using ChatGPT. We also found that students ask fewer follow-ups and use more keyword-based queries for search engines while their prompts to LLMs tend to explicitly ask for information.</p></details> | 7 pages |

ACH generates relatively few mutants (aka simulated faults), compared to traditional mutation testing. Instead, it focuses on generating currently undetected faults that are specific to an issue of concern. From these currently uncaught faults, ACH generates tests that can catch them, thereby `killing' the mutants and consequently hardening the platform against regressions. We use privacy concerns to illustrate our approach, but ACH can harden code against {\em any} type of regression. In total, ACH was applied to 10,795 Android Kotlin classes in 7 software platforms deployed by Meta, from which it generated 9,095 mutants and 571 privacy-hardening test cases. ACH also deploys an LLM-based equivalent mutant detection agent that achieves a precision of 0.79 and a recall of 0.47 (rising to 0.95 and 0.96 with simple pre-processing). ACH was used by Messenger and WhatsApp test-a-thons where engineers accepted 73% of its tests, judging 36% to privacy relevant. We conclude that ACH hardens code against specific concerns and that, even when its tests do not directly tackle the specific concern, engineers find them useful for their other benefits.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to FSE 2025 Industry Track</p></details> |

This study addresses these gaps for Modern Greek through three key contributions. First, we evaluate the performance of open-source (Llama-70b) and closed-source (GPT-4o mini) large language models (LLMs) on seven core NLP tasks with dataset availability, revealing task-specific strengths, weaknesses, and parity in their performance. Second, we expand the scope of Greek NLP by reframing Authorship Attribution as a tool to assess potential data usage by LLMs in pre-training, with high 0-shot accuracy suggesting ethical implications for data provenance. Third, we showcase a legal NLP case study, where a Summarize, Translate, and Embed (STE) methodology outperforms the traditional TF-IDF approach for clustering \emph{long} legal texts. Together, these contributions provide a roadmap to advance NLP in lesser-resourced languages, bridging gaps in model evaluation, task innovation, and real-world impact.</p></details> | <details><summary>NLP, ...</summary><p>NLP, Modern Greek, benchmark, machine learning, language resources</p></details> |

Such unstructured knowledge is subject to change due to updates through time from past to present. Equally important are the inconsistencies and inaccuracies occurring in different information sources. Consequently, the model's knowledge about an entity may be perturbed while training over the sequence of snapshots or at inference time, resulting in inconsistent and inaccurate model performance. In this work, we study the appropriateness of Large Language Models (LLMs) as repositories of factual knowledge. We consider twenty-four state-of-the-art LLMs that are either closed-, partially (weights), or fully (weight and training data) open-source. We evaluate their reliability in responding to time-sensitive factual questions in terms of accuracy and consistency when prompts are perturbed. We further evaluate the effectiveness of state-of-the-art methods to improve LLMs' accuracy and consistency. We then propose "ENtity-Aware Fine-tuning" (ENAF), a soft neurosymbolic approach aimed at providing a structured representation of entities during fine-tuning to improve the model's performance.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce a human-expert-inspired method to mitigate the hallucination of LLMs and enhance their performance in HDL code generation. We begin by constructing specialized paradigm blocks that consist of several steps designed to divide and conquer generation tasks, mirroring the design methodology of human experts. These steps include information extraction, human-like design flows, and the integration of external tools. LLMs are then instructed to classify the type of circuit in order to match it with the appropriate paradigm block and execute the block to generate the HDL codes. Additionally, we propose a two-phase workflow for multi-round generation, aimed at effectively improving the testbench pass rate of the generated HDL codes within a limited number of generation and verification rounds. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the functional correctness of the generated Verilog code</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by ISQED2025. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2407.18326</p></details> |

Existing research in ZS-VQA has proposed to leverage knowledge graphs or large language models (LLMs), respectively, as external information sources to help VQA model comprehend images and questions. However, LLMs often struggle in accurately interpreting specific question meanings. Meanwhile, although knowledge graph has rich entity relationships, it is challenging to effectively connect entities to individual image content for visual question answers. In this paper, we propose a novel design to combine knowledge graph and LLMs for zero-shot visual question answer. Our approach uses LLMs' powerful understanding capabilities to accurately interpret image content through a strategic question search mechanism. Meanwhile, the knowledge graph is used to expand and connect users' queries to the image content for better visual question answering. An optimization algorithm is further used to determine the optimal weights for the loss functions derived from different information sources, towards a globally optimal set of candidate answers. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Both source code and benchmark data will be released for public access.</p></details> |  |

Our real-world studies reveal that over 60% of user requests to LLMs have semantically similar counterparts, suggesting the potential for knowledge sharing among requests. However, naively caching and reusing past responses leads to large quality degradation. In this paper, we introduce EchoLM, an in-context caching system that leverages historical requests as examples to guide response generation, enabling selective offloading of requests to more efficient LLMs. However, enabling this real-time knowledge transfer leads to intricate tradeoffs between response quality, latency, and system throughput at scale. For a new request, EchoLM identifies similar, high-utility examples and efficiently prepends them to the input for better response. At scale, EchoLM adaptively routes requests to LLMs of varying capabilities, accounting for response quality and serving loads. EchoLM employs a cost-aware cache replay mechanism to improve example quality and coverage offline, maximizing cache utility and runtime efficiency. Evaluations on millions of open-source requests demonstrate that EchoLM has a throughput improvement of 1.4-5.9x while reducing latency by 28-71% without hurting response quality on average.</p></details> |  |

Furthermore, the advent of REST API documentation languages, such as the OpenAPI Specification, has led to the emergence of many black-box REST API testing tools. However, these tools often focus on individual test elements in isolation (e.g., APIs, parameters, values), resulting in lower coverage and less effectiveness in fault detection. To address these limitations, we present AutoRestTest, the first black-box tool to adopt a dependency-embedded multi-agent approach for REST API testing that integrates multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with a semantic property dependency graph (SPDG) and Large Language Models (LLMs). Our approach treats REST API testing as a separable problem, where four agents -- API, dependency, parameter, and value agents -- collaborate to optimize API exploration. LLMs handle domain-specific value generation, the SPDG model simplifies the search space for dependencies using a similarity score between API operations, and MARL dynamically optimizes the agents' behavior. Our evaluation of AutoRestTest on 12 real-world REST services shows that it outperforms the four leading black-box REST API testing tools, including those assisted by RESTGPT (which generates realistic test inputs using LLMs), in terms of code coverage, operation coverage, and fault detection. Notably, AutoRestTest is the only tool able to trigger an internal server error in the Spotify service. Our ablation study illustrates that each component of AutoRestTest -- the SPDG, the LLM, and the agent-learning mechanism -- contributes to its overall effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in the 47th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2025)</p></details> |

Scaling reinforcement learning (RL) unlocks a new axis for the continued improvement of artificial intelligence, with the promise that large language models (LLMs) can scale their training data by learning to explore with rewards. However, prior published work has not produced competitive results. In light of this, we report on the training practice of Kimi k1.5, our latest multi-modal LLM trained with RL, including its RL training techniques, multi-modal data recipes, and infrastructure optimization. Long context scaling and improved policy optimization methods are key ingredients of our approach, which establishes a simplistic, effective RL framework without relying on more complex techniques such as Monte Carlo tree search, value functions, and process reward models. Notably, our system achieves state-of-the-art reasoning performance across multiple benchmarks and modalities -- e.g., 77.5 on AIME, 96.2 on MATH 500, 94-th percentile on Codeforces, 74.9 on MathVista -- matching OpenAI's o1. Moreover, we present effective long2short methods that use long-CoT techniques to improve short-CoT models, yielding state-of-the-art short-CoT reasoning results -- e.g., 60.8 on AIME, 94.6 on MATH500, 47.3 on LiveCodeBench -- outperforming existing short-CoT models such as GPT-4o and Claude Sonnet 3.5 by a large margin (up to +550%).</p></details> | 25 pages |

In addition, many institutions utilize in-house LLMs and want to ensure that external, non-sanctioned LLMs do not produce content within the institution. In this paper, we answer the following question: Given a piece of text, can we identify whether it was produced by LLM $A$ or $B$ (where $B$ can be a human)? We model LLM-generated text as a sequential stochastic process with complete dependence on history and design zero-shot statistical tests to distinguish between (i) the text generated by two different sets of LLMs $A$ (in-house) and $B$ (non-sanctioned) and also (ii) LLM-generated and human-generated texts. We prove that the type I and type II errors for our tests decrease exponentially in the text length. In designing our tests, we derive concentration inequalities on the difference between log-perplexity and the average entropy of the string under $A$. Specifically, for a given string, we demonstrate that if the string is generated by $A$, the log-perplexity of the string under $A$ converges to the average entropy of the string under $A$, except with an exponentially small probability in string length. We also show that if $B$ generates the text, except with an exponentially small probability in string length, the log-perplexity of the string under $A$ converges to the average cross-entropy of $B$ and $A$. Lastly, we present preliminary experimental results to support our theoretical results. By enabling guaranteed (with high probability) finding of the origin of harmful LLM-generated text with arbitrary size, we can help combat misinformation.</p></details> |  |

Listening affords people more mobility than reading by seeing, thereby broadening their learning opportunities. This study explores the potential applications of large language models (LLMs) to adapt text documents to audio content and addresses the lack of listening-friendly materials for niche content, such as research papers. LLMs can generate scripts of audio content in various styles tailored to specific needs, such as full-content duration or speech types (monologue or dialogue). To explore this potential, we developed PaperWave as a prototype that transforms academic paper PDFs into conversational podcasts. Our two-month investigation, involving 11 participants (including the authors), employed an autobiographical design, a field study, and a design workshop. The findings highlight the importance of considering listener interaction with their environment when designing document-to-audio systems.</p></details> |  |

This paper addresses these limitations by leveraging advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) to develop a haptic agent, focusing specifically on Grounded Force Feedback (GFF) devices recommendation. Our approach involves automating the creation of a structured haptic device database using information from research papers and product specifications. This database enables the recommendation of relevant GFF devices based on user queries. To ensure precise and contextually relevant recommendations, the system employs a dynamic retrieval method that combines both conditional and semantic searches. Benchmarking against the established UEQ and existing haptic device searching tools, the proposed haptic recommendation agent ranks in the top 10\% across all UEQ categories with mean differences favoring the agent in nearly all subscales, and maintains no significant performance bias across different user groups, showcasing superior usability and user satisfaction.</p></details> |  |

Refactoring engines are integral components of modern Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and can automate or semi-automate this process to enhance code readability, reduce complexity, and improve the maintainability of software products. Similar to traditional software systems such as compilers, refactoring engines may also contain bugs that can lead to unexpected behaviors. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called RETESTER, a LLM-based framework for automated refactoring engine testing. Specifically, by using input program structure templates extracted from historical bug reports and input program characteristics that are error-prone, we design chain-of-thought (CoT) prompts to perform refactoring-preserving transformations. The generated variants are then tested on the latest version of refactoring engines using differential testing.

| **[Understanding the LLM-ification of CHI: Unpacking the Impact of LLMs at CHI through a Systematic Literature Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12557v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have been positioned to revolutionize HCI, by reshaping not only the interfaces, design patterns, and sociotechnical systems that we study, but also the research practices we use. To-date, however, there has been little understanding of LLMs' uptake in HCI. We address this gap via a systematic literature review of 153 CHI papers from 2020-24 that engage with LLMs. We taxonomize: (1) domains where LLMs are applied; (2) roles of LLMs in HCI projects; (3) contribution types; and (4) acknowledged limitations and risks. We find LLM work in 10 diverse domains, primarily via empirical and artifact contributions. Authors use LLMs in five distinct roles, including as research tools or simulated users. Still, authors often raise validity and reproducibility concerns, and overwhelmingly study closed models. We outline opportunities to improve HCI research with and on LLMs, and provide guiding questions for researchers to consider the validity and appropriateness of LLM-related work.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a preprint version of the paper conditionally accepted to CHI'25</p></details> |
| **[The Challenge of Using LLMs to Simulate Human Behavior: A Causal Inference Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15524v2)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive potential to simulate human behavior. We identify a fundamental challenge in using them to simulate experiments: when LLM-simulated subjects are blind to the experimental design (as is standard practice with human subjects), variations in treatment systematically affect unspecified variables that should remain constant, violating the unconfoundedness assumption. Using demand estimation as a context and an actual experiment as a benchmark, we show this can lead to implausible results. While confounding may in principle be addressed by controlling for covariates, this can compromise ecological validity in the context of LLM simulations: controlled covariates become artificially salient in the simulated decision process, which introduces focalism. This trade-off between unconfoundedness and ecological validity is usually absent in traditional experimental design and represents a unique challenge in LLM simulations. We formalize this challenge theoretically, showing it stems from ambiguous prompting strategies, and hence cannot be fully addressed by improving training data or by fine-tuning. Alternative approaches that unblind the experimental design to the LLM show promise. Our findings suggest that effectively leveraging LLMs for experimental simulations requires fundamentally rethinking established experimental design practices rather than simply adapting protocols developed for human subjects.</p></details> |  |
| **[MultiTok: Variable-Length Tokenization for Efficient LLMs Adapted from LZW Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21548v2)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models have drastically changed the prospects of AI by introducing technologies for more complex natural language processing. However, current methodologies to train such LLMs require extensive resources including but not limited to large amounts of data, expensive machinery, and lengthy training. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a new tokenization method inspired by universal Lempel-Ziv-Welch data compression that compresses repetitive phrases into multi-word tokens. With MultiTok as a new tokenizing tool, we show that language models are able to be trained notably more efficiently while offering a similar accuracy on more succinct and compressed training data. In fact, our results demonstrate that MultiTok achieves a comparable performance to the BERT and GPT-2 standards as both a stand-alone tokenizer and an add-on to existing tokenizers while also providing close to 2.5x faster training with more than 30% less training data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deploying Privacy Guardrails for LLMs: A Comparative Analysis of Real-World Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12456v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized AI applications but poses significant challenges in safeguarding user privacy. Ensuring compliance with privacy regulations such as GDPR and CCPA while addressing nuanced privacy risks requires robust and scalable frameworks. This paper presents a detailed study of OneShield Privacy Guard, a framework designed to mitigate privacy risks in user inputs and LLM outputs across enterprise and open-source settings. We analyze two real-world deployments:(1) a multilingual privacy-preserving system integrated with Data and Model Factory, focusing on enterprise-scale data governance; and (2) PR Insights, an open-source repository emphasizing automated triaging and community-driven refinements. In Deployment 1, OneShield achieved a 0.95 F1 score in detecting sensitive entities like dates, names, and phone numbers across 26 languages, outperforming state-of-the-art tool such as StarPII and Presidio by up to 12\%. Deployment 2, with an average F1 score of 0.86, reduced manual effort by over 300 hours in three months, accurately flagging 8.25\% of 1,256 pull requests for privacy risks with enhanced context sensitivity. These results demonstrate OneShield's adaptability and efficacy in diverse environments, offering actionable insights for context-aware entity recognition, automated compliance, and ethical AI adoption. This work advances privacy-preserving frameworks, supporting user trust and compliance across operational contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted at Deployable AI workshop at AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Is Long Context All You Need? Leveraging LLM's Extended Context for NL2SQL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12372v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across a range of natural language processing tasks. In particular, improvements in reasoning abilities and the expansion of context windows have opened new avenues for leveraging these powerful models. NL2SQL is challenging in that the natural language question is inherently ambiguous, while the SQL generation requires a precise understanding of complex data schema and semantics. One approach to this semantic ambiguous problem is to provide more and sufficient contextual information. In this work, we explore the performance and the latency trade-offs of the extended context window (a.k.a., long context) offered by Google's state-of-the-art LLM (\textit{gemini-1.5-pro}). We study the impact of various contextual information, including column example values, question and SQL query pairs, user-provided hints, SQL documentation, and schema. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to study how the extended context window and extra contextual information can help NL2SQL generation with respect to both accuracy and latency cost. We show that long context LLMs are robust and do not get lost in the extended contextual information. Additionally, our long-context NL2SQL pipeline based on Google's \textit{gemini-pro-1.5} achieve a strong performance with 67.41\% on BIRD benchmark (dev) without finetuning and expensive self-consistency based techniques.</p></details> | 14 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Automatic Labelling with Open-source LLMs using Dynamic Label Schema Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12332v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Acquiring labelled training data remains a costly task in real world machine learning projects to meet quantity and quality requirements. Recently Large Language Models (LLMs), notably GPT-4, have shown great promises in labelling data with high accuracy. However, privacy and cost concerns prevent the ubiquitous use of GPT-4. In this work, we explore effectively leveraging open-source models for automatic labelling. We identify integrating label schema as a promising technology but found that naively using the label description for classification leads to poor performance on high cardinality tasks. To address this, we propose Retrieval Augmented Classification (RAC) for which LLM performs inferences for one label at a time using corresponding label schema; we start with the most related label and iterates until a label is chosen by the LLM. We show that our method, which dynamically integrates label description, leads to performance improvements in labelling tasks. We further show that by focusing only on the most promising labels, RAC can trade off between label quality and coverage - a property we leverage to automatically label our internal datasets.</p></details> | 11 pages, 1 figure |
| **[A recent evaluation on the performance of LLMs on radiation oncology physics using questions of randomly shuffled options](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10622v3)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Purpose: We present an updated study evaluating the performance of large language models (LLMs) in answering radiation oncology physics questions, focusing on the recently released models. Methods: A set of 100 multiple-choice radiation oncology physics questions, previously created by a well-experienced physicist, was used for this study. The answer options of the questions were randomly shuffled to create "new" exam sets. Five LLMs -- OpenAI o1-preview, GPT-4o, LLaMA 3.1 (405B), Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet -- with the versions released before September 30, 2024, were queried using these new exam sets. To evaluate their deductive reasoning ability, the correct answer options in the questions were replaced with "None of the above." Then, the explain-first and step-by-step instruction prompts were used to test if this strategy improved their reasoning ability. The performance of the LLMs was compared with the answers from medical physicists. Results: All models demonstrated expert-level performance on these questions, with o1-preview even surpassing medical physicists with a majority vote. When replacing the correct answer options with 'None of the above', all models exhibited a considerable decline in performance, suggesting room for improvement. The explain-first and step-by-step instruction prompts helped enhance the reasoning ability of the LLaMA 3.1 (405B), Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet models. Conclusion: These recently released LLMs demonstrated expert-level performance in answering radiation oncology physics questions, exhibiting great potential to assist in radiation oncology physics education and training.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-Assisted Knowledge Graph Completion for Curriculum and Domain Modelling in Personalized Higher Education Recommendations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12300v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While learning personalization offers great potential for learners, modern practices in higher education require a deeper consideration of domain models and learning contexts, to develop effective personalization algorithms. This paper introduces an innovative approach to higher education curriculum modelling that utilizes large language models (LLMs) for knowledge graph (KG) completion, with the goal of creating personalized learning-path recommendations. Our research focuses on modelling university subjects and linking their topics to corresponding domain models, enabling the integration of learning modules from different faculties and institutions in the student's learning path. Central to our approach is a collaborative process, where LLMs assist human experts in extracting high-quality, fine-grained topics from lecture materials. We develop a domain, curriculum, and user models for university modules and stakeholders. We implement this model to create the KG from two study modules: Embedded Systems and Development of Embedded Systems Using FPGA. The resulting KG structures the curriculum and links it to the domain models. We evaluate our approach through qualitative expert feedback and quantitative graph quality metrics. Domain experts validated the relevance and accuracy of the model, while the graph quality metrics measured the structural properties of our KG. Our results show that the LLM-assisted graph completion approach enhances the ability to connect related courses across disciplines to personalize the learning experience. Expert feedback also showed high acceptance of the proposed collaborative approach for concept extraction and classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON2025), London, UK, 22-25 April, 2025</p></details> |
| **[Condor: Enhance LLM Alignment with Knowledge-Driven Data Synthesis and Refinement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12273v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The quality of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) data plays a critical role in enhancing the conversational capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, as LLMs become more advanced, the availability of high-quality human-annotated SFT data has become a significant bottleneck, necessitating a greater reliance on synthetic training data. In this work, we introduce Condor, a novel two-stage synthetic data generation framework that incorporates World Knowledge Tree and Self-Reflection Refinement to produce high-quality SFT data at scale. Our experimental results demonstrate that a base model fine-tuned on only 20K Condor-generated samples achieves superior performance compared to counterparts. The additional refinement stage in Condor further enables iterative self-improvement for LLMs at various scales (up to 72B), validating the effectiveness of our approach. Furthermore, our investigation into the scaling for synthetic data in post-training reveals substantial unexplored potential for performance improvements, opening promising avenues for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Tech ...</summary><p>Tech Report.

| **[You Can't Eat Your Cake and Have It Too: The Performance Degradation of LLMs with Jailbreak Defense](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12210v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rise of generative large language models (LLMs) like LLaMA and ChatGPT, these models have significantly transformed daily life and work by providing advanced insights. However, as jailbreak attacks continue to circumvent built-in safety mechanisms, exploiting carefully crafted scenarios or tokens, the safety risks of LLMs have come into focus. While numerous defense strategies--such as prompt detection, modification, and model fine-tuning--have been proposed to counter these attacks, a critical question arises: do these defenses compromise the utility and usability of LLMs for legitimate users? Existing research predominantly focuses on the effectiveness of defense strategies without thoroughly examining their impact on performance, leaving a gap in understanding the trade-offs between LLM safety and performance. Our research addresses this gap by conducting a comprehensive study on the utility degradation, safety elevation, and exaggerated-safety escalation of LLMs with jailbreak defense strategies. We propose USEBench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate these aspects, along with USEIndex, a comprehensive metric for assessing overall model performance. Through experiments on seven state-of-the-art LLMs, we found that mainstream jailbreak defenses fail to ensure both safety and performance simultaneously. Although model-finetuning performs the best overall, their effectiveness varies across LLMs. Furthermore, vertical comparisons reveal that developers commonly prioritize performance over safety when iterating or fine-tuning their LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[AdaServe: SLO-Customized LLM Serving with Fine-Grained Speculative Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12162v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces AdaServe, the first LLM serving system to support SLO customization through fine-grained speculative decoding. AdaServe leverages the logits of a draft model to predict the speculative accuracy of tokens and employs a theoretically optimal algorithm to construct token trees for verification. To accommodate diverse SLO requirements without compromising throughput, AdaServe employs a speculation-and-selection scheme that first constructs candidate token trees for each request and then dynamically selects tokens to meet individual SLO constraints while optimizing throughput. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that AdaServe achieves up to 73% higher SLO attainment and 74% higher goodput compared to state-of-the-art systems. These results underscore AdaServe's potential to enhance the efficiency and adaptability of LLM deployments across varied application scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contextualizing Recommendation Explanations with LLMs: A User Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12152v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly prevalent in recommender systems, where LLMs can be used to generate personalized recommendations. Here, we examine how different LLM-generated explanations for movie recommendations affect users' perceptions of cognitive, affective, and utilitarian needs and consumption intentions. In a pre-registered, between-subject online experiment (N=759) and follow-up interviews (N=30), we compare (a) LLM-generated generic explanations, and (b) LLM-generated contextualized explanations. Our findings show that contextualized explanations (i.e., explanations that incorporate users' past behaviors) effectively meet users' cognitive needs while increasing users' intentions to watch recommended movies. However, adding explanations offers limited benefits in meeting users' utilitarian and affective needs, raising concerns about the proper design and implications of LLM-generated explanations. Qualitative insights from interviews reveal that referencing users' past preferences enhances trust and understanding but can feel excessive if overused. Furthermore, users with more active and positive engagement with the recommender system and movie-watching get substantial gains from contextualized explanations. Overall, our research clarifies how LLM-generated recommendations influence users' motivations and behaviors, providing valuable insights for the future development of user-centric recommender systems, a key element in social media platforms and online ecosystems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Do LLMs Provide Links to Code Similar to what they Generate? A Study with Gemini and Bing CoPilot](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12134v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are currently used for various software development tasks, including generating code snippets to solve specific problems. Unlike reuse from the Web, LLMs are limited in providing provenance information about the generated code, which may have important trustworthiness and legal consequences. While LLM-based assistants may provide external links that are "related" to the generated code, we do not know how relevant such links are. This paper presents the findings of an empirical study assessing the extent to which 243 and 194 code snippets, across six programming languages, generated by Bing CoPilot and Google Gemini, likely originate from the links provided by these two LLM-based assistants. The study leverages automated code similarity assessments with thorough manual analysis. The study's findings indicate that the LLM-based assistants provide a mix of relevant and irrelevant links having a different nature. Specifically, although 66% of the links from Bing CoPilot and 28% from Google Gemini are relevant, LLMs-based assistants still suffer from serious "provenance debt".</p></details> |  |
